Business Explanation 

"This system automatically watches all of Dow’s competitors, customers, and suppliers on SEC.gov.
When they file something important like a financial report or incident disclosure, the system scores it, categorizes it, and sends Dow a summary report.
Instead of waiting weeks for lawyers to find this, Dow sees it instantly with direct links. This is exactly the pain point their compliance officer described."
