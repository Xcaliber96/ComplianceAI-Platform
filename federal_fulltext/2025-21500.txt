SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Abstract

    The gathering of this information is in keeping with the purposes 
of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA or the Act), Public 
Law 100-497, 25 U.S.C. 2701, et seq., which include: providing a 
statutory basis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes as a means 
of promoting tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong 
tribal governments; ensuring that the Indian tribe is the primary 
beneficiary of the gaming operation; and declaring that the 
establishment of independent federal regulatory authority for gaming on 
Indian lands, the establishment of federal standards for gaming on 
Indian lands, and the establishment of the Commission are necessary to 
meet congressional concerns regarding gaming and to protect such gaming 
as a means of generating tribal revenue. 25 U.S.C. 2702. The Act 
established the Commission and laid out a comprehensive framework for 
the regulation of gaming on Indian lands.

II. Data

    Title: Management Contract Provisions.
    OMB Control Number: 3141-0004.
    Brief Description of Collection: The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act 
(IGRA or the Act), Public Law 100-497, 25 U.S.C. 2701, et seq., 
established the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC or Commission) 
and laid out a comprehensive framework for the regulation of gaming on 
Indian lands. Amongst other actions necessary to carry out the 
Commission's statutory duties, the Act requires the NIGC Chair to 
review and approve all management contracts for the operation and 
management of class II and/or class III gaming activities, and to 
conduct background investigations of persons with direct or indirect 
financial interests in, and management responsibility for, management 
contracts. 25 U.S.C. 2710, 2711. The Commission is authorized to 
``promulgate such regulations and guidelines as it deems appropriate to 
implement'' IGRA. 25 U.S.C. 2706(b)(10). The Commission has promulgated 
parts 533, 535, and 537 of title 25, Code of Federal Regulations, to 
implement these statutory requirements.
    Section 533.2 requires a tribe or management contractor to submit a 
management contract for review within 60 days of execution, and to 
submit all the items specified in Sec.  533.3. Section 535.1 requires a 
tribe to submit an amendment to a management contract within 30 days of 
execution, and to submit all the items specified in Sec.  535.1(c). 
Section 535.2 requires a tribe or a management contractor, upon 
execution, to submit the assignment by a management contractor of its 
rights under a previously approved management contract. Section 537.1 
requires a management contractor to submit all of the items specified 
in Sec.  537.1(b),(c) in order for the Commission to conduct background 
investigations on: each person with management responsibility for a 
management contract; each person who is a director of a corporation 
that is a party to a management contract; the ten persons who have the 
greatest direct or indirect financial interest in a management 
contract; any entity with a financial interest in a management 
contract; and any other person with a direct or indirect financial 
interest in a management contract, as otherwise designated by the 
Commission. This collection is mandatory, and the benefit to the 
respondents is the approval of Indian gaming management contracts, and 
any amendments thereto.
    Respondents: Tribal governing bodies and management contractors.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 33.
    Estimated Annual Responses: 51 (submissions of contracts, contract 
amendments, contract assignments, and background investigation 
material).
    Estimated Time per Response: Depending on the type of submission, 
the range of time can vary from 1 burden hours to 16 burden hours for 
one item.
    Frequency of Response: Usually no more than once per year.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours on Respondents: 620.
    Estimated Total Non-hour Cost Burden: $ 125,271.
    Title: Fees.
    OMB Control Number: 3141-0007.
    Brief Description of Collection: The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act 
(IGRA or the Act), 25 U.S.C. 2701, et seq., laid out a comprehensive 
framework for the regulation of gaming on Indian lands. Amongst other 
actions necessary to carry out the Commission's statutory duties, the 
Act requires Indian tribes that conduct a class II and/or class III 
gaming activity to pay annual fees to the Commission based on the 
assessable gross revenues of each gaming operation using rates 
established by the Commission. 25 U.S.C. 2717. The Commission is 
authorized to ``promulgate such regulations and guidelines as it deems 
appropriate to implement'' IGRA. 25 U.S.C. 2706(b)(10). The Commission 
has promulgated part 514 of title 25, Code of Federal Regulations, to 
implement these statutory requirements.
    Section 514.6 requires a tribe to submit, along with its fee 
payments, quarterly fee statements (worksheets) showing its assessable 
gross revenues for the previous fiscal year to support the computation 
of fees paid by each gaming operation. Section 514.7 requires a tribe 
to submit a notice within 30 days after a gaming operation changes its 
fiscal year. Section 514.15 allows a tribe to submit fingerprint cards 
to the Commission for processing by the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI), along with a fee to cover the NIGC's and FBI's cost to process 
the fingerprint cards on behalf of the tribes. Part of this collection 
is mandatory, and the other part is voluntary. The required submission 
of the fee worksheets allows the Commission to both set and adjust

[[Page 54741]]

fee rates, and to support the computation of fees paid by each gaming 
operation. In addition, the voluntary submission of fingerprint cards 
allows a tribe to conduct statutorily mandated background 
investigations on applicants for key employee and primary management 
official positions.
    Respondents: Indian gaming operations.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 708.
    Estimated Annual Responses: 52,451.

fingerprint cards and fiscal year change notices).
    Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 31,098.
    Estimated Total Non-hour Cost Burden: $ 1,648,255.
    Title: Minimum Internal Control Standards for Class II Gaming.
    OMB Control Number: 3141-0009.
    Brief Description of Collection: The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act 
(IGRA or the Act), 25 U.S.C. 2701, et seq., laid out a comprehensive 
framework for the regulation of gaming on Indian lands. Amongst other 
actions necessary to carry out the Commission's statutory duties, the 
Act directs the Commission to monitor class II gaming conducted on 
Indian lands on a continuing basis in order to adequately shield Indian 
gaming from organized crime and other corrupting influences, to ensure 
that the Indian tribe is the primary beneficiary of the gaming 
operation, and to assure that gaming is conducted fairly and honestly 
by both the operator and players. 25 U.S.C. 2702(2), 2706(b)(1). The 
Commission is also authorized to ``promulgate such regulations and 
guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement'' IGRA. 25 U.S.C. 
2706(b)(10). The Commission has promulgated part 543 of title 25, Code 
of Federal Regulations, to aid it in monitoring class II gaming on a 
continuing basis.
    Section 543.3 requires a tribal gaming regulatory authority (TGRA) 
to submit to the Commission a notice requesting an extension to the 
deadline (by an additional six months) to achieve compliance with the 
requirements of the new tier after a gaming operation has moved from 
one tier to another. Section 543.5 requires a TGRA to submit a detailed 
report after the TGRA has approved an alternate standard to any of the 
NIGC's minimum internal control standards, and the report must contain 
all the items specified in Sec.  543.5(a)(2). Section 543.23(c) 
requires a tribe to maintain internal audit reports and to make such 
reports available to the Commission upon request. Section 543.23(d) 
requires a tribe to submit two copies of the agreed-upon procedures 
(AUP) report within 120 days of the gaming operation's fiscal year end. 
This collection is mandatory and allows the NIGC to confirm tribal 
compliance with the minimum internal control standards.

    Estimated Number of Respondents: 412.
    Estimated Annual Responses: 840.
    Estimated Time per Response: Depending on the tier level of the 
gaming facility, the range of time can vary from 1 burden hour to 7 
burden hours for one AUP audit report.
    Frequency of Response: Annually.

    Estimated Total Non-hour Cost Burden: $ 3,866,060.
    Title: Facility License Notifications and Submissions.
    OMB Control Number: 3141-0012.
    Brief Description of Collection: The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act 
(IGRA or the Act), 25 U.S.C. 2701, et seq., laid out a comprehensive 
framework for the regulation of gaming on Indian lands. Amongst other 
actions necessary to carry out the Commission's statutory duties, the 
Act requires Indian tribes that conduct class II and/or class III 
gaming to issue ``a separate license . . . for each place, facility, or 
location on Indian lands at which class II [and class III] gaming is 
conducted,'' 25 U.S.C. 2710(b)(1), (d)(1), and to ensure that ``the 
construction and maintenance of the gaming facilities, and the 
operation of that gaming is conducted in a manner which adequately 
protects the environment and public health and safety.'' 25 U.S.C. 
2710(b)(2)(E). The Commission is authorized to ``promulgate such 
regulations and guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement'' IGRA. 
25 U.S.C. 2706(b)(10). The Commission has promulgated part 559 of title 
25, Code of Federal Regulations, to implement these requirements.
    Section 559.2 requires a tribe to submit a notice (that a facility 
license is under consideration for issuance) at least 120 days before 
opening any new facility on Indian lands where class II and/or class 
III gaming will occur, with the notice containing all the items 
specified in Sec.  559.2(b). Section 559.3 requires a tribe to submit a 
copy of each newly issued or renewed facility license within 30 days of 
issuance. Section 559.4 requires a tribe to submit an attestation 
certifying that by issuing the facility license, the tribe has 
determined that the construction, maintenance, and operation of that 
gaming facility is conducted in a manner that adequately protects the 
environment and the public health and safety. Section 559.5 requires a 
tribe to submit a notice within 30 days if a facility license is 
terminated or expires or if a gaming operation closes or reopens. 
Section 559.6 requires a tribe to maintain and provide applicable and 
available Indian lands or environmental and public health and safety 
documentation, if requested by the NIGC. This collection is mandatory 
and enables the Commission to perform its statutory duty by ensuring 
that tribal gaming facilities on Indian lands are properly licensed by 
the tribes.
    Respondents: Indian tribal gaming operations.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 336.
    Estimated Annual Responses: 679.

    Title: Minimum Technical Standards for Class II Gaming Systems and 
Equipment.
    OMB Control Number: 3141-0014.
    Brief Description of Collection: The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act 
(IGRA or the Act), 25 U.S.C. 2701, et seq., laid out a comprehensive 
framework for the regulation of gaming on Indian lands. Amongst other 
actions necessary to carry out the Commission's statutory duties, the 
Act directs the Commission to monitor class II gaming conducted on 
Indian lands on a continuing basis in order to adequately shield Indian 
gaming from organized crime and other corrupting influences, to ensure 
that the Indian tribe is the primary beneficiary of the gaming 
operation, and to assure that gaming is conducted fairly and honestly 
by both the operator and players. 25 U.S.C. 2702(2), 2706(b)(1). The 
Act allows Indian tribes to use ``electronic, computer, or other 
technologic aids'' to conduct class II gaming activities. 25 U.S.C. 
2703(7)(A). The Commission is authorized to ``promulgate such 
regulations and guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement'' IGRA. 
25 U.S.C. 2706(b)(10). The Commission has promulgated part 547 of title 
25, Code of Federal Regulations, to aid it in monitoring class II 
gaming facilities that

[[Page 54742]]

are using electronic, computer, or other technologic aids to conduct 
class II gaming.
    Section 547.5(a)(2) requires that, for any grandfathered class II 
gaming system made available for use at any tribal gaming operation, 
the tribal gaming regulatory authority (TGRA): must retain copies of 
the gaming system's testing laboratory report, the TGRA's compliance 
certificate, and the TGRA's approval of its use; and must maintain 
records identifying these grandfathered class II gaming systems and 
their components. Section 547.5(b)(2) requires that, for any class II 
gaming system generally, the TGRA must retain a copy of the system's 
testing laboratory report and maintain records identifying the system 
and its components. As long as a class II gaming system is available to 
the public for play, section 547.5(c)(3) requires a TGRA to maintain 
records of any modification to such gaming system and a copy of its 
testing laboratory report. Section 547.5(d)(3) requires a TGRA to 
maintain records of approved emergency hardware and software 
modifications to a class II gaming system (and a copy of the testing 
laboratory report) so long as the gaming system remains available to 
the public for play and must make the records available to the 
Commission upon request. Section 547.5(f) requires a TGRA to maintain 
records of its following determinations: (i) regarding a testing 
laboratory's (that is owned or operated or affiliated with a tribe) 
independence from the manufacturer and gaming operator for whom it is 
providing the testing, evaluating, and reporting functions; (ii) 
regarding a testing laboratory's suitability determination based upon 
standards no less stringent than those set out in 25 CFR 
533.6(b)(1)(ii) through (v) and based upon no less information than 
that required by 25 CFR 537.1; and/or (iii) the TGRA's acceptance of a 
testing laboratory's suitability determination made by any other gaming 
regulatory authority in the United States. The TGRA must maintain said 
records for a minimum of three years and must make the records 
available to the Commission upon request. Section 547.17 requires a 
TGRA to submit a detailed report for each enumerated standard for which 
the TGRA approves an alternate standard, and the report must include: 
(i) an explanation of how the alternate standard achieves a level of 
security and integrity sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the 
standard it is to replace; and (ii) the alternate standard as approved 
and the record on which the approval is based. This collection is 
mandatory and allows the NIGC to confirm tribal compliance with NIGC 
regulations on ``electronic, computer, or other technologic aids'' to 
conduct class II gaming activities.
    Respondents: Tribal governing bodies.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 811.
