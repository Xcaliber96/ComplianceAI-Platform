Federal Communications Commission (FCC or the Commission) invites the 
general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to 
comment on the following information collection. Comments are requested 
concerning: whether the proposed collection of information is necessary 
for the proper performance of the functions of the Commission, 
including whether the information shall have practical utility; the 
accuracy of the Commission's burden estimate; ways to enhance the 
quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; ways to 
minimize the burden of the collection of information on the

unless it displays a currently valid control number. No person shall be 
subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection of 
information subject to the PRA that does not display a valid Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) control number.

DATES: Written PRA comments should be submitted on or before January

    Needs and Uses: On August, 23, 2016, the Federal Communications 
Commission released a Report and Order, FCC 16-113, PS Docket No. 15-
199 that modified Part 90 of the Rules Private Land Mobile Radio 
Services. The amended rule revises the Part 90 eligibility rules to 
permit railroad police officers to access the interoperability. 
Specifically, the Commission modified Section 90.20(xiv) to provide 
that:
    (xiv)(A) Railroad police officers are a class of users eligible to 
operate on the nationwide interoperability and mutual aid channels 
listed in 90.20(i) provided their employer holds a Private Land Mobile 
Radio (PLMR) license of any radio category, including Industrial/
Business (I/B). Eligible users include full and part time railroad 
police officers, Amtrak employees who qualify as railroad police 
officers under this subsection, Alaska Railroad employees who qualify 
as railroad police officers under this subsection, freight railroad 
employees who qualify as railroad police officers under this 
subsection, and passenger transit lines police officers who qualify as 
railroad police officers under this subsection. Railroads and railroad 
police departments may obtain licenses for the nationwide 
interoperability and mutual aid channels on behalf of railroad police 
officers in their employ. Employers of railroad police officers must 
obtain concurrence from the relevant state interoperability coordinator 
or regional planning committee before applying for a license to the 
Federal Communications Commission or operating on the interoperability 
and mutual aid channels.
    (1) Railroad police officer means a peace officer who is 
commissioned in his or her state of legal residence or state of primary 
employment and employed, full or part time, by a railroad to enforce 
state laws for the protection of railroad property, personnel, 
passengers, and/or cargo.
    (2) Commissioned means that a state official has certified or 
otherwise designated a railroad employee as qualified under the 
licensing requirements of that state to act as a railroad police 
officer in that state.
    (3) Property means rights-of-way, easements, appurtenant property, 
equipment, cargo, facilities, and buildings and other structures owned, 
leased, operated, maintained, or transported by a railroad.
    (4) Railroad means each class of freight railroad (i.e., Class I, 
II, III); Amtrak, Alaska Railroad, commuter railroads and passenger 
transit lines.
    (5) The word state, as used herein, encompasses states, territories 
and the District of Columbia.
    (B) Eligibility for licensing on the 700 MHz narrowband 
interoperability channels is restricted to entities that have as their 
sole or principal purpose the provision of public safety services.
    To effectively implement the provisions of the Rule, no other

[[Page 55115]]

modifications to existing FCC rules are required. The changes are 
intended to simplify the licensing process for railroad police officers 
and ensure interoperable communications. The modified rules provide a 
benefit to public safety licensees by ensuring that only railroad 
police officers with appropriate governmental authorization can operate 
on the interoperability and mutual aid channels during emergencies. 
This will provide the additional benefit of promoting interoperability 
with railroad police officers by eliminating eligibility as a gating 
factor when licensing spectrum. The Report and Order reduces the burden 
on railroad police by allowing them to meet eligibility standard by 
requiring employers of railroad police officers to obtain concurrence 
from the relevant state interoperability coordinator or regional 
planning committee before applying for a license to the Federal 
Communications Commission or operating on the interoperability and 
mutual aid channels. Compliance with this requirement is already a 
requisite for public safety eligibility to use the interoperability and 
mutual aid channels, consequently any new burden imposed by this 
requirement would be minimal.

Federal Communications Commission.
