[Public Notice: 12869]


Foreign Terrorist Organization Designation of Cartel de los Soles

    Based upon a review of the Administrative Record assembled in this 
matter, and in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary 
of the Treasury, I have concluded that there is a sufficient factual 
basis to find that the relevant circumstances described in section 219 
of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (hereinafter 
``INA'') (8 U.S.C. 1189), exist with respect to: Cartel de los Soles 
(also known as Cartel of the Suns).
    Therefore, I hereby designate the aforementioned organization and 
its respective aliases as a Foreign Terrorist Organization pursuant to 
section 219 of the INA.
    This determination shall be published in the Federal Register. The 
designation goes into effect upon publication.

    Dated: November 16, 2025.
Marco Rubio,
Secretary of State.
