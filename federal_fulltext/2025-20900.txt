SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 1. On October 17, 2024, the Commission 
issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to amend 
the index level used to determine annual changes to oil pipeline rate 
ceilings.\1\ The Supplemental NOPR requested comment regarding (a) 
changing the current index level of Producer Price Index for Finished 
Goods plus 0.78% (PPI-FG+0.78% (Initial Index)) to PPI-FG-0.21% 
(Rehearing Index) and (b) other issues related to the appropriate index 
level following the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) in Liquid Energy 
Pipeline Association v. FERC.\2\

proceeding.

I. Background

A. Indexing and the Kahn Methodology

    3. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct 1992) required the 
Commission to establish a ``simplified and generally applicable'' 
ratemaking methodology \3\ that was consistent with the just and 
reasonable standard of the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA).\4\ To 
implement this mandate, the Commission issued Order No. 561,\5\ 
establishing an indexing methodology that allows oil pipelines to 
change their rates subject to certain ceiling levels as opposed to 
making cost-of-service filings.\6\ In Order No. 561, the Commission 
committed to review the index level every five years to ensure that it 
adequately reflects changes to industry costs.\7\ The Commission 
conducted five-year index reviews in 2000,\8\ 2005,\9\ 2010,\10\ and 
2015.\11\

    \6\ Pursuant to the Commission's indexing methodology, oil 
pipelines change their rate ceiling levels effective every July 1 by 
``multiplying the previous index year's ceiling level by the most 
recent index published by the Commission.'' 18 CFR 342.3(d)(1). Oil 
pipelines may adjust their rates to the ceiling levels pursuant to 
Commission's regulations so long as no protest or complaint 
demonstrates that the index rate change substantially diverges from 
the pipeline's cost changes. Id. 343.2(c)(1).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. In Order No. 561 and each successive five-year review, the 
Commission has calculated the index level based upon a methodology 
developed by Dr. Alfred E. Kahn.\12\ The Kahn Methodology uses pipeline 
data from FERC Form No. 6, page 700 from the prior five-year period to 
determine an appropriate adjustment to be applied to PPI-FG. The 
calculation is as follows. Each pipeline's cost change on a per-barrel 
mile basis over the prior five-year period (e.g., the years 2014-2019) 
is calculated. In order to capture normal industry cost experience, the 
resulting data set is trimmed by removing an equal number of pipelines 
from the top and bottom of the data set. The Kahn Methodology then 
calculates three measures of the trimmed data sample's central 
tendency: the median, the mean, and a weighted mean.\13\ The Kahn 
Methodology calculates a composite by averaging these measures of 
central tendency and measures the difference between the composite and 
the PPI-FG over the prior five-year period. The Commission then sets 
the index level at PPI-FG plus (or minus) this differential.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ The D.C. Circuit has affirmed the Commission's use of the 
Kahn Methodology. AOPL I, 83 F.3d at 1433-37; Flying J Inc. v. FERC, 
363 F.3d at 497-500.
    \13\ The weighted mean assigns a different weight to each 
pipeline's cost change based upon the pipeline's total barrel-miles.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. The 2020 Five-Year Review

    5. The 2020 five-year review addressed the index level for the July 
1, 2021, to June 30, 2026 period.\14\ In December of 2020, the 
Commission's Initial Order \15\ adopted the Initial Index level of PPI-
FG+0.78%. As relevant here, the Commission determined the Initial 
Index, in part, by: (1) adjusting the data for Master Limited 
Partnership (MLP) pipelines to remove the effects of a 2018 policy 
change (Income Tax Policy Change), and (2) trimming the data set to the 
middle 80% of cost changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ The Commission initiated the 2020 five-year review by 
issuing a Notice of Inquiry in June of 2020. Five-Year Rev. of the 
Oil Pipeline Index, 171 FERC ] 61,239 (2020).
    \15\ Five-Year Rev. of the Oil Pipeline Index, 173 FERC ] 61,245 
(2020) (Initial Order), order on reh'g, 178 FERC ] 61,023 (2022) 
(Rehearing Order), vacated sub nom. LEPA v. FERC, 109 F.4th 543.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. First, the Commission considered whether to adjust the data to 
remove the effects of the Income Tax Policy Change. As noted above, the 
Commission measures industry-wide cost changes using data from 
pipelines' Form No. 6, page 700 for the five years prior to the start 
of the five-year review, here, 2014 to 2019. In 2018, the Commission 
changed its policy regarding the recovery of income tax costs and 
required MLP pipelines to eliminate their income tax allowance and 
Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes (ADIT) balances from their page 
700s.\16\ As a result, the 2014 page 700 data for MLP pipelines 
reflected the Commission's old policy while the 2019 page 700 data 
reflected the new policy. In the Initial Order, the Commission adjusted 
for this by removing the effects of the Income Tax Policy Change.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ See Inquiry Regarding the Comm'n Pol'y for Recovery of 
Income Tax Costs, 162 FERC ] 61,227 (2018 Income Tax Policy 
Statement), reh'g denied, 164 FERC ] 61,030 (2018), requests for 
clarification dismissed, 168 FERC ] 61,136 (2019), petitions for 
review dismissed sub nom. Enable Miss. River Transmission, LLC v. 
FERC, 820 F. App'x 8 (D.C. Cir. 2020).
    \17\ For any pipelines that were MLPs in 2014, the Commission 
set the 2014 page 700 income tax allowance to zero and revised the 
2014 return on rate base to reflect the removal of ADIT. Initial 
Order, 173 FERC ] 61,245 at P 16.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7. Second, the Initial Order trimmed the data set to the middle 80% 
of cost

[[Page 53257]]

changes. As noted above, the Kahn Methodology statistically trims the 
page 700 data by removing an equal number of pipelines from the top and 
bottom of the data set to remove outlying and anomalous data that can 
distort the measure of central tendency. Participants in the 2020 five-
year review proceeding disputed whether to trim the data to the middle 
80% or the middle 50% of cost changes. The Commission determined that 
using the middle 80% was appropriate for this index review.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ Id. P 25.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    8. In January 2021, shippers filed requests for rehearing of the 
Initial Order. While those rehearing requests were pending, the 
Commission published a new annual index on May 14, 2021, consistent 
with the Initial Order.\19\ Pipelines proceeded to make rate filings, 
which became effective July 1, 2021, reflecting the Initial Order.

Finished Goods, 175 FERC ] 61,117 (2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9. In January 2022, the Commission issued the Rehearing Order \20\ 
adopting the lower Rehearing Index level of PPI-FG-0.21%.\21\ In the 
Rehearing Order, the Commission reversed course on the two issues 
described above: the Commission calculated the Rehearing Index (1) 
using unadjusted page 700 data that reflected the Income Tax Policy 
Change, and (2) trimming the data set to the middle 50% of cost 
changes.\22\ In addition, the Commission addressed certain relatively 
minor computational issues identified by pipelines related to the 
appropriate source for the 2014 data from page 700.\23\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    10. The Commission directed pipelines to recompute their ceiling 
levels and reduce their rates to reflect the lower Rehearing Index, 
effective March 1, 2022.\24\ Certain parties appealed the Rehearing 
Order.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ Id. P 106.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. LEPA v. FERC and Reinstatement Order

    11. In LEPA v. FERC, the D.C. Circuit vacated the Rehearing 
Order.\25\ The court held that the Commission's Rehearing Order 
violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by amending the Initial 
Index without providing notice and an opportunity for comment. The 
court explained that once an agency's rule ``carrie[s] legal 
consequences,'' the APA requires the agency to follow notice-and-
comment procedures before amending the rule.\26\ The court found that 
the Initial Index became ``sufficiently final'' by July 1, 2021, when 
pipelines' rates for the first year of the five-year period became 
effective, ``to require that any amendment undergo notice-and-comment 
procedures.'' \27\ Because the Commission changed the index to the 
Rehearing Index level and required pipelines to lower their rates 
without providing notice-and-comment procedures, the court vacated the 
Rehearing Order and ordered the Commission to reinstate the Initial 
Order.

(D.C. Cir. 2022)) (internal quotation marks omitted).
    \27\ Id. at 549.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    12. On September 17, 2024, the Commission issued an order 
reinstating the Initial Order in compliance with the court's 
decision.\28\ The Commission directed oil pipelines to recompute their 
ceiling levels for a second time to reflect the Initial Index and 
explained that pipelines could file to prospectively increase their 
indexed rates up to their recomputed ceiling levels.\29\ The Commission 
also stated that it would address other issues following LEPA v. FERC 
in a subsequent order.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    13. Parties continued to file comments in Docket No. RM20-14 
disputing the appropriate index level following LEPA v. FERC.\30\ Among 
other things, shippers argued that the Commission should reinstitute 
the Rehearing Order vacated by LEPA v. FERC and consider their 
rehearing requests.\31\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ In addition, certain shippers filed a Petition for Action 
requesting the Commission readopt the Rehearing Index in notice-and-
comment proceedings. Five-Year Review of the Oil Pipeline Index, 
Joint Shippers Petition for Action Following Vacatur and Remand of 
Five-Year Index Review Decision, Docket No. RM20-14-003, (filed Sep.

II. Supplemental NOPR

A. Supplemental NOPR

    14. In order to resolve the ongoing disputes over whether the index 
should be modified following LEPA v. FERC and to comply with the 
court's holding that any change must be accomplished through APA 
notice-and-comment procedures, the Commission issued the Supplemental 
NOPR. The Commission proposed to amend the index level to PPI-FG-0.21% 
(the same level as the Rehearing Index) and sought comments on its 
proposal. The Commission proposed to amend the index level on a 
prospective basis for the remainder of the five-year period. More 
specifically, the Commission proposed the following:
    [ssquf] Calculating Prospective Ceiling Levels: The Commission 
proposed that pipelines recalculate their ceiling levels as though the 
amended index level of PPI-FG-0.21% was effective throughout the five-
year period beginning in 2021.\32\ However, the Commission noted that 
commenters could address, in the alternative, if ceiling levels should 
only reflect a revised index level as of July 1, 2025, rather than the 
full five-year period.\33\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \32\ Under this approach, pipelines would recalculate their July 
1, 2025 ceiling levels using the revised index level for 2021, 2022, 
2023, and 2024.
    \33\ Supplemental NOPR, 189 FERC ] 61,030 at P 37.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [ssquf] Income Tax Policy Change: The Commission proposed to use 
unadjusted page 700 data that reflects the Income Tax Policy Change, 
consistent with the Rehearing Order, rather than the adjusted data used 
in the Initial Order.\34\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ Id. PP 24-34.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [ssquf] Statistical Data Trimming: The Commission proposed to trim 
the data set to the middle 50% of cost changes, as the Commission did 
in the Rehearing Order, rather than the middle 80% adopted by the 
Initial Order.\35\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \35\ Id. PP 13-23.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [ssquf] Appropriate Source of 2014 Page 700 Data: The Commission 
proposed to use page 700 data for 2014 from more recent filings made in 
April 2016 rather than the outdated 2014 data filed in April 2015. The 
Commission explained that the Initial Order inadvertently used outdated 
page 700 data for 2014.\36\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \36\ Id. PP 35-36.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    15. The Commission acknowledged that it had never previously 
undertaken a rulemaking to consider revisions to the index level 
outside of the five-year review process. However, the Commission found 
it appropriate to initiate new notice-and-comment procedures given the 
D.C. Circuit's holdings in LEPA v. FERC and ongoing concerns with the 
Initial Index.\37\ The Commission emphasized that commenters could 
address any issues or concerns associated with the proposal to revise 
the index level during the five-year period.\38\

B. Comments

    16. Initial comments on the Supplemental NOPR were filed on 
November 26, 2024, and reply comments were filed on December 20, 2024. 
In general, pipeline commenters (Pipelines) \39\ oppose the 
Commission's proposal to revise the index level. Pipelines assert that 
amending the index level at this time would disrupt settled 
expectations, cause regulatory uncertainty, and incentivize litigation 
over pipeline rates.\40\ By contrast, shipper commenters (Shippers) 
\41\ support the Commission's proposal.

Company (Shell).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    17. Regarding the Commission's proposal to calculate ceiling levels 
as if any revised index was effective for the entire five-year period, 
Pipelines argue that the Commission's proposal is inconsistent with the 
vacatur of the Rehearing Order and the D.C. Circuit's directive in LEPA 
v. FERC to reinstate the Initial Order.\42\ Additionally, Pipelines 
argue that the Commission's proposal is inconsistent with Commission 
regulations,\43\ and constitutes impermissible retroactive rulemaking 
\44\ and retroactive ratemaking.\45\ Shippers dispute Pipelines' claims 
that the Commission's proposal constitutes retroactive rulemaking or 
ratemaking.\46\ Shippers argue that the Commission's proposal ensures 
that going-forward rates reflect any revised index level adopted in 
this proceeding,\47\ and conforms to the Commission's practice in the 
2000 index review.\48\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    18. Pipelines oppose the Commission's proposal to calculate a 
revised index level using page 700 data that incorporates the Income 
Tax Policy Change. Pipelines argue that because previous index reviews 
did not incorporate the Commission's policy allowing MLP pipelines to 
recover a full income tax allowance, it would be improper to reflect 
the 2018 policy change removing the MLP income tax allowance in this 
review.\49\ Additionally, Pipelines contend that most pipelines in the 
data set are not MLPs and the double recovery is not widely reflected 
in MLP pipelines' rates.\50\ In contrast, Shippers argue that the 
Commission's proposal to reflect the Income Tax Policy Change in the 
index calculation conforms with indexing's purpose of tracking changes 
in recoverable costs,\51\ regardless of whether individual MLP 
pipelines' rates incorporate the income tax double recovery.\52\ 
Shippers contend that implementing the Income Tax Policy Change as 
proposed fulfills EPAct 1992's mandates for simplified and streamlined 
ratemaking while ensuring just and reasonable rates.\53\ Pipelines also 
oppose the Commission's proposal to trim the data set to the middle 
50%, arguing that the record in this proceeding supports using the 
middle 80%.\54\ Shippers, on the other hand, support the Commission's 
proposal and argue that the middle 50% conforms to past Commission 
practice and is a better measure of normal cost changes.\55\

III. Discussion

    19. Upon consideration of the record in this proceeding and given 
the late stage of the five-year review period that began July 1, 2021, 
and concludes June 30, 2026, we are not persuaded to proceed with the 
proposal considered in the Supplemental NOPR. The Commission initiated 
the Supplemental NOPR to allow industry-wide comment on ``all issues 
related to the appropriate index level following LEPA v. FERC,'' \56\ 
including whether to modify the index level outside the five-year 
review process based on the issues discussed in the Rehearing 
Order.\57\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \56\ Supplemental NOPR, 189 FERC ] 61,030 at P 2.
    \57\ Id. PP 13-34.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    20. We conclude that the best course of action is to allow the 
current index level to remain effective for the remainder of this five-
year period. The question before the Commission in the instant 
proceeding is not what action the Commission should have taken in 2020 
at the beginning of this five-year review. Rather, the question 
presented here is whether in 2025 the Commission should now change the 
index level prospectively in the last year of this five year period as 
proposed in the Supplemental NOPR.\58\ Changing the index level for a 
fourth time in the fifth year of the five-year period \59\ would 
prolong ongoing regulatory uncertainty regarding the index level.\60\ 
As

[[Page 53259]]

discussed below, we do not find that the record supports taking such a 
step. Moreover, at this stage, the benefits of any index change are 
limited, as pipelines made the last annual indexed rate filing of the 
five-year period in June 2025.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \58\ As with any rulemaking, any action the Commission might 
take to amend the index level through notice-and-comment procedures 
may be prospective only. Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 
204, 208 (1988); see also LEPA v. FERC, 109 F.4th at 547.
    \59\ After establishing the Initial Index for this five-year 
period in 2020 and after 201 pipelines filed rates pursuant to that 
index effective July 1, 2021, the Commission changed the index level 
twice. First, the Commission issued the Rehearing Order on January 
20, 2022 and pipelines filed rates to comply with the Rehearing 
Order's lower index made effective March 1, 2022. Then, following 
LEPA v. FERC, the Commission issued the Reinstatement Order on 
September 17, 2024, which restored the Initial Index and pipelines 
once again refiled rates and ceiling levels.
    \60\ As noted above, indexing is intended to provide a 
``simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for oil 
pipelines'' under EPAct 1992. EPAct 1992 1801(a). Consistent with 
that goal, the Commission established a framework under which the 
Commission would review the index once every five years. Order No. 
561, FERC Stats. & Regs. ] 30,985 at 30,946-47.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    21. We therefore exercise our discretion to withdraw the 
Supplemental NOPR and terminate this rulemaking proceeding. We address 
below the Supplemental NOPR's proposals regarding (1) recalculation of 
prospective ceiling levels, (2) the Income Tax Policy Change, (3) 
statistical data trimming, and (4) the appropriate source of 2014 Page 
700 data.\61\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \61\ The Supplemental NOPR also requested comment on any 
additional remedial steps the Commission should take following LEPA 
v. FERC. Because we decline to adjust the index level, we reject 
Shippers' arguments that they are entitled to remedies for any part 
of the five-year period based on the application of a lower index 
level than the Initial Index. We decline to address here whether 
Pipelines are entitled to remedies for the period between March 1, 
2022 and September 17, 2024 when the Rehearing Index was in effect. 
Instead, we address this issue in a concurrent order in Docket No. 
RM20-14. See Revisions to Oil Pipeline Reguls. Pursuant to the 
Energy Pol'y Act of 1992, Order Denying Rehearing, Denying Petition 
and Granting Remedies, 193 FERC ] 61,137 (2025).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Calculating Prospective Ceiling Levels

    22. We are not persuaded to adopt the Supplemental NOPR's proposal 
to require pipelines to recalculate ceiling levels effective 
prospectively from the issuance of this rule as though a revised index 
resulting from this rulemaking was effective starting July 1, 2021.\62\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \62\ Supplemental NOPR, 189 FERC ] 61,030 at P 37. As explained 
above, the indexing methodology allows oil pipelines to change their 
rates, effective every July 1, subject to specific ceiling levels, 
which pipelines recalculate annually by multiplying their previous 
year's ceiling level by the annual index published by the 
Commission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    23. As explained further below, commenters raised extensive 
questions and concerns regarding this proposal, including assertions 
that this proposal departs from the Commission's indexing framework and 
regulations, and runs afoul of the rules against retroactive rulemaking 
and retroactive ratemaking. On balance, we are not convinced that the 
Commission should recalculate pipeline ceiling levels for the preceding 
four years of the five-year period.
    24. First, commenters argue that the proposal to recalculate prior 
ceiling levels departs from the Commission's indexing framework and 
regulations.\63\ Although the Commission can amend its rules through 
notice-and-comment rulemakings, we recognize that the proposal to 
recalculate the ceiling levels for multiple past years would be an 
unprecedented departure from the Commission's existing indexing 
policies and regulations, in which the index is ``cumulative from year 
to year,'' \64\ and each annual index is applied to a pipeline's 
ceiling level from the preceding year.\65\ Moreover, each year's index 
is based upon the prior years' cost changes, not some other adjustment 
as proposed in the Supplemental NOPR.\66\ Pipeline rates are bound by 
those annual ceiling rate changes.\67\

    \65\ 18 CFR 342.3(d)(1).
    \66\ In particular, section 342.3(d)(1) of the Commission's 
regulations requires pipelines to compute the ceiling level for each 
index year by multiplying the previous index year's ceiling level by 
the most recent index. 18 CFR 342.3(d)(1).
    \67\ Carriers are permitted to raise their rates to unused 
ceiling levels at any time after those ceiling levels are 
established and while they remain in effect. Id.; id. 342.3(a). 
Conversely, the Commission prohibited pipelines from filing rates 
exceeding their ceiling levels except in very specific 
circumstances. Order No. 561, FERC Stats. & Regs. ] 30,985 at 
30,947; 18 CFR 342.4(a)-(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    25. Second, the Commission designed the cumulative ceiling level 
approach to achieve EPAct 1992's ``criteria of simplicity and general 
applicability'' \68\ and ``reduce[ ] the necessity and likelihood of 
prolonged litigation.'' \69\ Yet another change to the ceiling levels 
that were in place over the prior four years would directly contravene 
such mission, adding even more complexity and is thus in tension with 
the index's simplified design.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    26. Third, we acknowledge significant debate in the record 
regarding whether the remedy proposed in the Supplemental NOPR 
constitutes impermissible retroactive rulemaking and retroactive 
ratemaking.\70\ While we decline to address the scope of the 
Commission's remedial authority in this rulemaking context, we are not 
persuaded that perpetuating and exacerbating uncertainty for the final 
year of this index cycle is warranted.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    27. We are not persuaded by other arguments advanced by Shippers. 
Although the Shippers argue that the proposal is necessary to ensure 
that the ``flaws'' of the Initial Index do not result in inflated 
ceiling levels going forward,\71\ as discussed below, we find those 
flaws to be overstated.

    28. We recognize that Shippers cite to the 2000 five-year review as 
one prior instance in which the Commission directed pipelines to 
recalculate index increases over multiple years for prospective effect 
in rates.\72\ However, we believe this case is distinguishable. The 
Commission's decision to recalculate ceiling levels in the 2000 five-
year review was made in addressing the legal error identified by the 
D.C. Circuit on remand,\73\ whereas any recalculation of ceiling levels 
as proposed in the Supplemental NOPR would occur in response to a 
rulemaking. Thus, we are not persuaded that the Commission's decision 
in the 2000 five-year review would support adoption of the Supplemental 
NOPR's proposal on ceiling levels.

    \73\ Id. The D.C. Circuit remanded the Commission's December 
2000 order establishing the index level on the grounds that the 
Commission had not adequately addressed the concerns raised by 
certain pipelines. See AOPL II, 281 F.3d at 245-46.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    29. In sum, we conclude that the benefit of rate certainty at this 
late stage of the current five-year index cycle generally counsels 
against the Supplemental NOPR's proposal to revise the index going back 
more than four years. It would be an unprecedented step for the 
Commission to take such action, and we are concerned about establishing 
a practice here that could justify additional disruption of subsequent 
index periods. On balance, we are not persuaded to adopt the 
Supplemental NOPR's proposal to recalculate pipeline ceiling levels for 
the full five-year period.

B. Income Tax Policy Change

    30. We are not persuaded to modify the index level to incorporate 
the Income Tax Policy Change as proposed in the Supplemental NOPR in 
order to address an income tax double recovery in pipeline rates. As 
discussed below, there are valid arguments against taking such action, 
particularly in the fifth year of the five-year index.
    31. As an initial matter, it is not clear the extent to which an 
income tax double recovery exists in oil pipeline rates. The income tax 
double recovery concern applies only to MLP pipelines, less than half 
of the pipelines subject to

[[Page 53260]]

the index.\74\ Moreover, as the Initial Order explained, it is not 
clear that the income tax double recovery is widely incorporated in 
those MLP pipelines' rates. The Commission only permitted MLP pipelines 
to include a full income tax allowance in their costs of service 
between 2005 and 2018. During that period, the Commission's index 
reviews did not actually incorporate the Commission's policies allowing 
MLP pipelines to recover an income tax allowance.\75\ Although the 
Commission's prior income tax policy influenced MLP pipelines' rates in 
other ways,\76\ MLP pipelines are only a subset of all pipelines and 
the Supplemental NOPR acknowledged that MLP pipelines' rates only 
``imperfectly captured the 2005 income tax policy change'' that allowed 
MLPs to recover a full income tax allowance.\77\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \74\ Seventy of the 160 pipelines in the data set (or 
approximately 44%) were organized as MLPs when the Commission 
adopted the Income Tax Policy Change. See Designated Carriers 
Initial Comments, Aff. of Dr. Michael J. Webb, at P 48 & n.60 (Webb 
Aff.).
    \75\ Before the Commission updated its calculation of the index 
in the 2015 Index Review to use page 700 data, the Kahn Methodology 
used net carrier property as a proxy for capital costs and income 
taxes. 2015 Index Review, 153 FERC ] 61,312 at P 14 (citing Order 
No. 561-A, FERC Stats. & Regs. ] 31,000 at 31,096, 31,098). This 
proxy did not reflect changes in the Commission's Opinion No. 154-B 
cost-of-service methodology, including changes to the Commission's 
income tax policy. As a result, the Commission's prior policies 
permitting MLP pipelines to recover a full or partial income tax 
allowance were never directly incorporated into the index.
    \76\ See Supplemental NOPR, 189 FERC ] 61,030 at P 33. For 
example, as the Supplemental NOPR observed, 164 of the 277 total oil 
pipelines in the Commission's data set, or 59%, have been added 
since the 2005 five-year review. Supplemental NOPR, 189 FERC ] 
61,030 at n.68. Those pipelines either filed cost-of-service rates 
directly incorporating the income tax allowance or negotiated rates 
under the circumstances of the Commission's income tax policies for 
MLP pipelines.
    \77\ Supplemental NOPR, 189 FERC ] 61,030 at P 33; see also 
Inquiry Regarding Income Tax Allowances, 111 FERC ] 61,139, at P 32 
(2005).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    32. Second, to the extent the income tax double recovery was 
incorporated into MLP pipelines' rates, the index provides an 
incomplete mechanism for remedying this issue because it would not 
fully remove any double recoveries from MLP pipeline rates. The index 
reflects an average of all pipelines' cost changes on an industry-wide 
basis,\78\ including the cost changes of non-MLP pipelines that were 
not affected by the Income Tax Policy Change. Accordingly, the 
reduction to the index level that results from reflecting the Income 
Tax Policy Change provides an imprecise mechanism for addressing any 
MLP pipeline double recoveries.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \78\ E.g., Order No. 561-A, FERC Stats. & Regs. ] 31,000 at 
31,103 (explaining that indexing ``relies upon industry-wide average 
costs . . . to establish rates'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    33. Third, the late-stage of this proceeding (the fifth year of the 
five-year review) significantly reduces the effectiveness of the index 
as a mechanism for addressing the income tax double recovery. To 
meaningfully address the income tax double recovery, as proposed in the 
Supplemental NOPR, the Commission would need to direct pipelines to 
recompute their ceiling levels and rates as though the revised index 
level was effective for the full five-year period beginning July 1, 
2021. As discussed above, however, this presents considerable concerns, 
and thus we decline to take such a step.\79\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \79\ Supra PP 22-29.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    34. Finally, attempting to address the double recovery via the 
index reduces the index for pipelines that have no double recovery. For 
example, it is not clear that index reductions to address the double 
recovery are necessary for MLP pipelines whose revenues under-recover 
costs.\80\ Whereas shippers may file cost-of-service complaints in 
those circumstances where pipelines' rates are excessive in light of 
the Income Tax Policy Change, making an industry-wide adjustment of the 
index level for the only remaining year of the five-year period would 
be both overbroad (in capturing pipelines who do not have a double-
recovery embedded in rates) and have limited effectiveness (in only 
capturing a fraction of any double-recovery).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \80\ Even where an MLP pipeline filed a cost-of-service rate 
that included a full income tax allowance or negotiated a settlement 
rate based on the Commission's prior income tax policy, it is not 
clear that the pipeline is presently over-recovering its cost of 
service. For instance, when the Commission evaluated whether natural 
gas pipelines were over-recovering their costs of service as a 
result of the Income Tax Policy Change, the resulting proceedings 
did not result in rate reductions for most pipelines. Interstate & 
Intrastate Nat. Gas Pipelines, Order No. 849-A, 84 FR 17739 (April 
26, 2019), 167 FERC ] 61,051, at P 4 (2019) (stating that of 120 
natural gas pipelines that filed FERC Form No. 501-G in response to 
Order No. 849, 84 pipelines explained why no change to their cost-
of-service rates was necessary following the Income Tax Policy 
Change).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    35. In 2020, at the beginning of this five-year review period, the 
income tax allowance double recovery issue was an issue of first 
impression that the Commission in 2020 addressed by removing the 
effects of that change from the calculation of the index.\81\ It is now 
2025, the fifth year of the five-year index process, and the benefit of 
rate certainty support leaving the index undisturbed.\82\ None of the 
comments \83\ undermine the factual findings above and, as explained 
above, we decline to modify the index level for a policy change that 
was only partially incorporated into pipeline rates and where, to the 
extent any double recovery exists, any modifications we could make at 
this stage would provide an imprecise and limited resolution to the 
double-recovery issue.\84\

    \84\ We decline to resolve the differing positions in the 
Initial Order and the Supplemental NOPR, regarding whether the index 
should generally reflect policy changes embedded in the Opinion No. 
154-B cost of service. See Supplemental NOPR, 189 FERC ] 61,030 at P 
30 (citing Initial Order, 173 FERC ] 61,245 at P 17). Similarly, we 
do not resolve whether reflecting the Income Tax Policy Change would 
effectuate a true-up for prior-period over-recoveries. Id. P 31 
(citing Initial Order, 173 FERC ] 61,245 at P 18). As necessary, 
those issues can be addressed in subsequent five-year review 
proceedings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    36. We acknowledge that the Commission stated in the 2018 Income 
Tax Policy Statement that it would ``incorporate the effects of the 
post-United Airlines policy changes . . . on industry-wide oil pipeline 
costs in the 2020 five-year review.'' \85\ However, these statements 
were not binding,\86\ and the Commission later reconsidered those 
statements in the Initial Order and decided a different course of 
action was more appropriate.\87\ We find that at this late stage any 
potential benefits of addressing the Income Tax Policy Change through 
the index calculation are significantly attenuated, and do not outweigh 
the disruption and regulatory

[[Page 53261]]

uncertainty that revising the index level again would entail.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Statistical Data Trimming

    37. We likewise decline to adopt the Supplemental NOPR's proposal 
to modify the index level by using the middle 50% instead of the middle 
80% of cost changes.
    38. We find that any benefits that may result from using the middle 
50% do not justify revising the index level at this late stage in the 
five-year review period. The record demonstrates that using the middle 
50% would reduce the index level by 33 basis points, from PPI-FG+0.78% 
to PPI-FG+0.45%.\88\ Moreover, this change would be only for one year 
and affect pipeline rates by \1/3\ of one percent or 0.33%.\89\ It 
would represent an extremely small percentage of the total pipeline 
indexed rate changes over the five-year review period, and, when 
considered over the five-year period, this 0.33% effect is de minimis. 
Indexing necessarily involves some degree of imprecision.\90\ Even in a 
more traditional ratemaking framework, a change of 0.33% above or below 
a pipeline's cost of service is within expected imprecision in rates 
over any period of time.\91\ Neither ratemaking generally nor the index 
in particular are so exact.\92\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \88\ LEPA Initial Comments, Declaration of Dr. Ramsey D. 
Shehadeh, at Ex. A4 (Shehadeh Decl.).
    \89\ For example, assume that Pipeline A's ceiling level was $10 
on June 30, 2021. Thus, Pipeline A's ceiling level would be $12.748 
following the reinstatement of the index level of PPI-FG+0.78% 
pursuant to LEPA v. FERC (10 * 0.994188 * 1.097007 * 1.143094 * 
1.022547 = 12.748). See Order Reinstating Index, 189 FERC ] 61,173 
at P 1 (listing index multipliers reflecting PPI-FG+0.78% index 
level for July 1, 2021-June 30, 2025). In addition, assume that the 
annual change in PPI-FG from 2023-2024 is 1.22%, which reflects the 
most recent data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
available at <a href="https://data.bls.gov/toppicks?survey=bls">https://data.bls.gov/toppicks?survey=bls</a> (accessible by 
selecting ``PPI Finished Goods 1982 + 100 (Unadjusted) - 
WPUFD49207'' and clicking ``Retrieve data''). Using the index of 
PPI-FG+0.78%, Pipeline A's ceiling level would increase from $12.748 
to $13.004 effective July 1, 2025 (12.748 * (1 + 0.0122 + 0.0078)) = 
13.0036). By contrast, using a revised index of PPI-FG+0.45% that 
reflects the middle 50% for July 1, 2025-June 30, 2026, Pipeline A's 
ceiling level would increase from $12.748 to $12.961 (12.748 * (1 + 
0.0122 + 0.0045) = 12.9609). As a result, revising the index level 
using the middle 50% at this stage would only reduce Pipeline A's 
ceiling level by $0.043 (or 0.33%).
    \90\ E.g., Order No. 561, FERC Stats. & Regs. ] 30,985 at 30,949

actual cost changes experienced by individual pipelines and the rate 
changes permitted by the index is inevitable''); 2005 Index Review, 
114 FERC ] 61,293 at P 57 (explaining that in adopting indexing, the 
Commission ``recognized in adopting a uniform index for all 
pipelines that inevitably some pipelines would over-earn while 
others will under-earn''); see also Joint Commenters Reply Comments 
at 69 (stating that ``indexing is necessarily inexact to some 
degree'').
    \91\ For example, between 2018 and 2019, 156 of the 160 
pipelines in the data set had a change in billing determinants 
(throughput) exceeding plus or minus 0.33%. Likewise, between 2018 
and 2019, 94% of pipelines had page 700 costs of service per barrel-
mile changes exceeding plus or minus 0.33%.
    \92\ See, e.g., Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. v. FERC, 45 
F.4th 265, 286 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (stating that ``courts have long 
recognized that ratemaking is `much less a science than an art' '') 
(quoting Ala. Elec. Coop., Inc. v. FERC, 684 F.2d 20, 27 (D.C. Cir. 
1982)); Farmers Union Cent. Exch., Inc. v. FERC, 734 F.2d 1486, 1502 
(D.C. Cir. 1984) (explaining that there is a ``zone of 
reasonableness'' for just and reasonable rates).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    39. The question before the Commission is not the index that should 
be in place for the full five-year index period, but whether there is 
sufficient basis to change the Commission-established index in the 
fifth year of the five-year review period. As discussed above, this 
record does not justify such an unprecedented step.

D. Appropriate Source of 2014 Page 700 Data

    40. As explained in the Supplemental NOPR,\93\ page 700 includes 
columns for reporting summary cost-of-service data for both the current 
year and the previous year. The more recently filed data reported in 
the previous-year column often updates the data that was filed in the 
prior year. As a result, for the first year of the index review period 
in the five-year review, the Commission uses updated page 700 data 
filed in the following year's Form No. 6, where available.\94\ However, 
in the Initial Order, the Commission inadvertently departed from its 
prior practice by using outdated page 700 data for 2014.\95\ Thus, the 
Supplemental NOPR proposed to calculate a revised index level using 
updated page 700 data for 2014, where available, as reported in the 
previous-year column in the Form No. 6 filings submitted in April 
2016.\96\

a witness was ``correct to use the data contained in [a] resubmitted 
FERC Form No. 6'').
    \95\ Specifically, although 38 pipelines filed updated 2014 data 
in April 2016, the Initial Order erroneously relied on those 
pipelines' originally filed 2014 data as reported in April 2015.

    41. After further consideration, we decline to adopt the proposal 
in the Supplemental NOPR. Consistent with our determination above, we 
conclude that any benefit of adopting this proposal would not justify 
the additional disruption that would result from modifying the index 
level for a fourth time at this late stage of the five-year period.

IV. Conclusion

    42. As discussed above, upon review of the record in this 
proceeding and given the late stage of the five-year review period that 
began July 1, 2021, we are not persuaded to proceed with the proposals 
considered in the Supplemental NOPR. Thus, we withdraw the Supplemental 
NOPR and terminate this rulemaking proceeding.
    The Commission orders:
    The Supplemental NOPR is hereby withdrawn and Docket No. RM25-2-000 
is hereby terminated.

    By the Commission.
    Issued: November 20, 2025.
Debbie-Anne A. Reese,
Secretary.
