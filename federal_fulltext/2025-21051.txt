that document on each person on the official service list for the 
project. Further, if an intervenor files comments or documents with the

    k. This application has been accepted for filing, and is ready for

    l. Project Description: The existing project consists of a 27-foot-
high dam known as the Forestport Dam, that includes a 315-foot-long 
ogee spillway. The Forestport Dam creates an impoundment that has a 
surface area of 118 acres at a normal surface elevation of 1,126.55 
feet National Geodetic Vertical Datum 1929 (NGVD29).
    From the impoundment, water flows through gates and a canal to a 
forebay known as Alder Pond. Alder Pond has a surface area of 24 acres 
at a normal surface elevation of 1,124.6 feet NGVD29 and is formed by a 
550-foot-long, 15-foot-high earth embankment known as Alder Pond Dam.
    From Alder Pond, water flows through a power canal to an intake 
structure with trashracks with 1.75-inch clear bar spacing. From the 
intake structure, water flows through a penstock to a powerhouse that 
includes a 3.3-megawatt (MW) S-type Kaplan turbine-generator. From the 
powerhouse, water is released into a tailrace that discharges into the 
Black River.
    The project generators are connected to the regional electric grid 
by generator lead lines and a 4.16/46-kV transformer.
    Project recreation facilities include: (1) Alder Pond parking and 
access area, adjacent to the east side of the Alder Pond Dam; (2) 
Forestport impoundment parking and access area, adjacent to the 
Forestport Dam on the northwest shore of the Forestport impoundment; 
(3) an approximately 1,200 foot-long portage route from the Forestport 
access area to the Alder Pond access area; (4) an approximately 150-
foot-long power canal portage route; and (5) a powerhouse parking and 
access area.
    Forestport Hydro proposes to: (1) continue operating the project in 
a run-of-river mode and maintaining the surface elevation of the 
Forestport impoundment at 1,126.55 feet NGVD29;

[[Page 53287]]

(2) continue to maintain the surface elevation of Alder Pond between 
1,123.6 and 1,124.6 feet NGVD29; (3) continue to release a minimum flow 
of 140 cfs or inflow, whichever is less, over the Forestport Dam; (4) 
implement a Bat and Bald Eagle Management Plan and an Invasive Species 
Management Plan; (5) develop an operation compliance monitoring plan; 
(6) continue to maintain existing project recreation facilities and 
update directional and safety signage; (7) move the power canal portage 
take-out site upstream of the boat barrier; and (8) to protect cultural 
resources, consult with the New York State Historic Preservation 
Officer before beginning any land-clearing or land-disturbing 
activities.
    m. A copy of the application can be viewed on the Commission's 
website at <a href="http://www.ferc.gov">http://www.ferc.gov</a> using the ``eLibrary'' link. Enter the
