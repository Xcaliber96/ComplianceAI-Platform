Information Collection Request

    Title: Applications for Merchant Mariner Credentials and Medical 
Certificates.
    OMB Control Number: 1625-0040.
    Summary: This information is necessary to determine competency, 
character and physical qualifications for the issuance of a Merchant 
Mariner Credential (MMC) or Medical Certificate.

[[Page 55148]]

    Need: 46 CFR parts 10-13 and 16 detail the requirements for the 
issuance of an MMC or Medical Certificate.
    Forms:

<bullet> CG-718A, Certificate of Discharge to Merchant Mariner.
<bullet> CG-719B, Application for Merchant Mariner Credential.
<bullet> CG-719C, Disclosure Statement for Narcotics, DWI/DUI, and/or 
Other Convictions.
<bullet> CG-719D, Application for Duplicate Merchant Mariner Credential 
and Medical Certificate.
<bullet> CG-719K, Application for Medical Certificate.
<bullet> CG-719K/E, Application for Medical Certificate, Short Form.
<bullet> CG-719P, DOT/USCG Periodic Drug Testing Form.
<bullet> CG-719S, Small Vessel Sea Service Form.

    Basis for the change to the Forms: The majority of changes to the 
forms in this collection are not associated with new statutory or 
regulatory authority, but rather improvements to the flow and quality 
of content, user functionality, and to aid the Coast Guard in 
processing applications. The forms have undergone significant 
reorganization in response to recommendations from the National 
Merchant Mariner Medical Advisory Committee (NMEDMAC), the National 
Merchant Marine Personnel Advisory Committee (NMERPAC), and comments 
from the public provided at the NMEDMAC and NMERPAC public meetings. As 
an example, the wording, location and specificity of form instructions 
were revised to provide better clarity and to improve ease of use. Key 
instructions are now located within the corresponding section of the 
form to reduce the need for mariner applicants to flip back and forth 
between pages to search for instructions. This improvement is also 
expected to reduce processing delays caused by submission of incomplete 
forms. Another improvement is that these forms will now provide an 
option for applicants to sign the forms using an electronic signature. 
Finally, additional language was added to Criminal Record Review 
section of the CG-719B to clarify that mariners must disclose all 
convictions, including convictions for boating safety crimes. 
Additionally, for applicants without convictions who have used or been 
addicted to dangerous drugs, the CG-719B form now provides a place for 
them to list the drugs used without having to fill out a CG-719C.
    Basis for the change for the addition of Forms to this collection: 
First, the Coast Guard is proposing to add a new optional form, the CG-
719D, to provide a convenient option for individuals who want to 
request a duplicate merchant mariner credential or duplicate medical 
certificate. Second, the Coast Guard seeks comments on adding form CG-
718A ``Certificate of Discharge to Merchant Mariner'' into this 
collection. Coast Guard personnel use form CG-718A to evaluate an 
applicant for an MMC. Form CG-718A was previously accounted for under 
OMB Control Number 1625-0012.
    Respondents: Applicants for MMC, whether original, renewal, 
duplicate, raise of grade, or a new endorsement on a previously issued 
MMC. Applicants for Medical Certificates to include National and STCW 
credentialed mariners, and first-class pilots.
    Frequency: On occasion.
    Hour Burden Estimate: The estimated burden has decreased from 
62,006 hours to 57,333 hours a year; due to a decrease in the estimated 
annual number of responses.

    Authority:  The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995; 44 U.S.C. 
chapter 35, as amended.

    Dated: November 26, 2025.
Bradley E. White,
(Acting) Chief, Office of Privacy Management, U.S. Coast Guard.
