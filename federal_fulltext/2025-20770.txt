SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Description: The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), 
as amended, authorizes the Secretary of HHS to expand benefits and 
services to victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons in the 
U.S. Through TVAP, grant recipients provide time-limited comprehensive 
case management services to confirmed and potential victims of a severe 
form of human trafficking, as defined by TVPA, as amended, who are 
seeking or have received HHS certification. Case management services 
must be provided to qualified persons directly by full-time case 
managers that are staffed by the prime recipient and may also be 
provided through a network of per capita service providers.
    OTIP proposes to continue to collect information to measure grant 
project performance, provide technical assistance to grant recipients, 
assess program outcomes, inform program evaluation, respond to 
congressional inquiries and mandated reports, and inform policy and 
program development that is responsive to the needs of victims.
    The information collection captures information on participant 
demographics (e.g., age, sex, type of trafficking experienced, service 
location) and services provided, along with aggregate information on 
outreach activities conducted, subrecipients enrolled, and dollars 
spent per service. Minor nonsubstantive updates have been made to 
performance indicators under this collection to simplify response 
options or to bring the collection into alignment with OTIP's grant 
recipient reporting database, the Anti-Trafficking Information 
Management System (ATIMS).
    Respondents: TVAP grant recipients and clients of those programs, 
specifically: TVAP and the Aspire: Child Trafficking Victim Assistance 
Demonstration Program funding recipients.

Annual Burden Estimates

    Based on review of performance data received pertaining to the 
number of clients served through TVAP programs and funding levels, the 
total number of respondents for each form has been lowered. The time to 
complete each form remains the same.
