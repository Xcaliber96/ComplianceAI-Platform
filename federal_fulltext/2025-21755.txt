SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Public Comments Invited: You are asked to comment on any aspect of 
this information collection, including (a) Whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for FAA's performance; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimated burden; (c) ways for FAA to enhance the

ways that the burden could be minimized without reducing the quality of 
the collected information. The agency will summarize and/or include

    OMB Control Number: 2120-xxxx.
    Title: Reauthorization Section 769 Survey to Evaluate Airport 
Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) Staffing Levels.
    Form Numbers: N/A.
    Type of Review: This is a review of a new information collection.
    Background: Currently, 14 CFR 139.319 does not require an 
individual to be trained as an emergency medical technician (EMT). 
Instead, section 139.319(i)(4) requires one individual, who has been 
trained and is current in basic emergency medical services, to be 
available during air carrier operations. Section 769(a) of the FAA 
Reauthorization Act of 2024 (the ``Act'') instructs the FAA to update 
section 139.319 to ensure that at least one individual maintains 
certification at the EMT basic level, or higher, at a small, medium, or 
large hub airport. Section 769(b) of the Act also requires the FAA to 
conduct a review of airport environments and related regulations to 
evaluate sufficient staffing levels necessary for firefighting, rescue, 
and emergency medical services and responses at airports certified 
under part 139.
    To carry out the requirements of section 769 of the Act, the FAA 
will develop a questionnaire to:
    <bullet> Establish an initial baseline of airport rescue staffing 
levels/resources;
    <bullet> Assist the FAA in conducting a staffing review of airports 
to evaluate sufficient staffing levels necessary for emergency medical 
services at Part 139 airports; and
    <bullet> Support its upcoming Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
addressing the EMT certification requirement.
    Respondents: Approximately 518 airports.
    Frequency: Once.
    Estimated Average Burden per Response: 3 hours.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden: 1,554 hours.

    Issued in Washington, DC, on 28 November 2025.
Anthony M. Butters,
Acting Manager, Airport Safety and Operations (AAS-300).
