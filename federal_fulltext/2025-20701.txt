Project (P-8369-050).
    m. The application is not ready for environmental analysis at this 
time.
    Project Description: The project includes a dam with a spillway 
crest elevation of 1,528.0 feet National Geodetic Vertical Dam of 1929 
(NGVD 29). The dam creates an impoundment that has a surface area of 
1,360 acres at 1,528.0 feet NGVD 29. From the impoundment, water flows 
through an intake structure located on the southern shoreline of the 
impoundment, approximately 100 feet upstream of the dam. The intake 
structure includes trashracks with 1-inch clear bar spacing. From the 
intake structure, water flows to a powerhouse that contains a 200-
kilowatt Kaplan turbine-generator unit. Water is discharged from the 
powerhouse to a tailrace that empties into the Saranac River.
    Electricity generated at the powerhouse is transmitted to the 
electric grid via an underground generator lead line, transformer, and 
overhead transmission line.
    Project recreation facilities include: (1) Riverside Park that 
includes picnic tables and a pavilion; (2) Hydropoint Park that 
includes a hand-carry boat access site on the shoreline of the 
impoundment; (3) Beaver Park that includes a hand-carry boat put-in 
site on the west bank of the Saranac River downstream of the dam; and 
(4) the River Walk that includes a recreation trail along the Saranac 
River.
    The Village proposes to: (1) continue operating the project in a 
run-of-river mode such that project outflow approximates inflow to the 
impoundment and the normal maximum surface elevation of the impoundment 
is maintained at 1,528.67 feet NGVD 29; (2) continue releasing a 
minimum flow of 55 cfs or inflow, whichever is less, as measured 
immediately downstream of the dam; (3) continue maintaining the project 
recreation facilities; (4) implement invasive species and bat and bald 
eagle plans filed with the license application; and (5) implement an 
impoundment drawdown plan and operation and compliance monitoring plan 
filed with the license application.
    n. In addition to publishing the full text of this notice in the 
Federal Register, the Commission provides all interested persons an 
opportunity to view and/or print the contents of this notice, as well
