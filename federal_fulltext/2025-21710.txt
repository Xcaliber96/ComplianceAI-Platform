    Pursuant to section 157.9 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and 
Procedure,\1\ within 90 days of this Notice the Commission staff will 
either: complete its environmental review and place it into the 
Commission's public record (eLibrary) for this proceeding; or issue a 
Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review. If a Notice of Schedule 
for Environmental Review is issued, it will indicate, among other 
milestones, the anticipated date for the Commission staff's issuance of 
the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) or environmental 
assessment (EA) for this proposal. The filing of an EA in the 
Commission's public record for this proceeding or the issuance of a 
Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review will serve to notify 
federal and state agencies of the timing for the completion of all 
necessary reviews, and the subsequent need to complete all federal 
authorizations within 90 days of the date of issuance of the Commission 
staff's FEIS or EA.

Time on December 16, 2025.
    There are three methods you can use to submit your comments or 
protests to the Commission. In all instances, please reference the 
Project docket number CP26-23-000 in your submission.
    (1) You may file your comments electronically by using the eComment 
feature, which is located on the Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ferc.gov">www.ferc.gov</a> 
under the link to Documents and Filings. Using eComment is an easy 
method for interested persons to submit brief, text-only comments on a 
project;
    (2) You may file your comments or protests electronically by using 
the eFiling feature, which is located on the Commission's website 
(<a href="http://www.ferc.gov">www.ferc.gov</a>) under the link to Documents and Filings. With eFiling, 
you can provide comments in a variety of formats by attaching them as a 
file with your submission. New eFiling users must first create an 
account by clicking on ``eRegister.'' You will be asked to select the 
type of filing you are making; first select ``General'' and then select 
``Comment on a Filing''; or
    (3) You can file a paper copy of your comments or protests by 
mailing them to the following address below. Your written comments must 
reference the Project docket number (CP26-23-000).

    Persons who comment on the environmental review of this project 
will be placed on the Commission's environmental mailing list, and will

issued for this project and will be notified of meetings associated 
with the Commission's environmental review process.
    The Commission considers all comments received about the project in 
determining the appropriate action to be taken. However, the filing of 
a comment alone will not serve to make the filer a party to the 
proceeding. To become a party, you must intervene in the proceeding. 
For instructions on how to intervene, see below.

municipalities, and other entities,\6\ has the option to file a motion

Courts of Appeal.

    All timely, unopposed \9\ motions to intervene are automatically 
granted by operation of Rule 214(c)(1).\10\ Motions to intervene that 
are filed after the intervention deadline are untimely, and may be 
denied. Any late-filed motion to intervene must show good cause for 
being late and must explain why the time limitation should be waived 
and provide justification by reference to factors set forth in Rule 
214(d) of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.\11\ A person 
obtaining party status will be placed on the service list maintained by 
the Secretary of the Commission and will receive copies (paper or
