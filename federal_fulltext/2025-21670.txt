33 CFR Part 117

[Docket No. USCG-2025-0999]
RIN 1625-AA09


Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Passaic River, Between the City 
of Newark and Town of Kearny, NJ

AGENCY: Coast Guard, DHS.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Coast Guard proposes to modify the operating regulation 
that governs the Point No Point Railroad Bridge across the Passaic 
River, mile 2.6, between the City of Newark and Town of Kearny, NJ. The 
proposed change in the regulation will allow the bridge to be remotely 
operated from the Conrail North Jersey Dispatch Center in Mount Laurel, 
NJ. This proposed change will alter the operating schedule of the 
bridge to open on signal and no longer require a four-hour advance 
notice. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.

DATES: Comments and related material must be received by the Coast 
Guard on or before December 31, 2025.

ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments identified by docket number USCG-
2025-0999 at <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a>.
    See the ``Public Participation and Request for Comments'' portion 
of the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section below for instructions on 
submitting comments. This notice of proposed rulemaking with its plain-
language, 100-word-or-less proposed rule summary will be available in 
this same docket.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: If you have questions on this proposed 
rule, call or email Mr. Gregory P. Hitchen, Northeast Coast Guard 
District (dpb), the Coast Guard; telephone 571-607-8154, email

II. Background, Purpose and Legal Basis

    The Point No Point Railroad Bridge across the Passaic River, 
between the City of Newark and Town of Kearny, NJ, mile 2.6, owned and 
operated by Conrail, has a vertical clearance of 20 feet above mean 
high water when closed and is unlimited when open.
    This proposed regulation will allow the bridge to be remotely 
operated from the Conrail North Jersey Dispatch Center in Mount Laurel, 
NJ. The current operating schedule is published in 33 CFR 117.739(c). 
With the implementation of remote operation of the bridge, the 
operating schedule will change to allow the bridge to open on signal 
versus requiring a four-hour advance notice. There are 30 daily train 
transits that cross the bridge and an average of one bridge opening 
every six months for vessel transits. The bridge is normally maintained 
in the closed position due to the average daily number of trains 
crossing the bridge. The Passaic River has limited commercial and 
recreational vessel traffic. Most commercial traffic supports marine 
construction projects in the waterway.
    The Coast Guard is proposing to allow remote operations to improve 
the efficiency of bridge openings. Currently the Conrail train 
dispatcher in Mount Laurel NJ must dispatch bridge operating personnel 
to open the Point No Point Railroad Bridge. Remote operations will 
allow the Conrail train dispatcher to open the bridge on signal.
    The legal basis for this rulemaking is 33 U.S.C. 499.

III. Discussion of Proposed Rule

    This proposed operating regulation will allow the Point No Point 
Railroad Bridge to be operated remotely from the Conrail North Jersey 
Dispatch Center in Mount Laurel, NJ. The remote operations system 
includes eight camera views (four marine and four rail), marine radar, 
sonar, automated integration system (AIS) sensors, integration 
software, a dedicated phone line for bridge operations, and 
radiotelephone communications on VHF-FM channels 13 and 16.
    The remote operation system is designed to provide equal or greater 
capabilities compared to the on-site bridge tender, in visibility of 
the waterway and bridge, and in signals (communications) via sound and 
visual signals and radio telephone (voice) via VHF-FM channels 13 and 
16. The remote operation system also incorporates a dedicated telephone 
line for bridge operations and push-to-talk (PTT) capability on VHF-FM 
channels 13. Vessels that require an opening shall continue to request 
an opening via the methods (sound or visual signals or radio telephone 
(VHF-FM) voice

[[Page 55064]]

communications) as defined in 33 CFR 117.15(b) through (d), via 
telephone at (856) 231-2301, or push-to-talk (PTT) on VHF-FM channel 
13. Vessels may push the PTT button five times while on VHF-FM channel 
13 and the North Jersey Dispatch Center will receive and respond to the 
request and commence opening of the bridge.
    The remote operation system will be considered failed and qualified 
personnel will return and operate the Point No Point Railroad Bridge 
within 60 minutes if any of the following conditions are found: (1) The 
remote operation system becomes incapable of safely and effectively 
operating the bridge from the remote operation center, (2) visibility 
of the waterway or bridge is degraded to less than equal that of an on-
site bridge tender (all eight camera views are required), or (3) 
signals (communications) via sound or visual signals or radio telephone 
(voice) via VHF-FM channels 13 or 16 become inoperative.

IV. Regulatory Analyses

    We developed this proposed rule after considering numerous statutes 
and Executive Orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our 
analyses based on these statutes and Executive Orders.

A. Impact on Small Entities

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, as 
amended, requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of 
regulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term ``small 
entities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations 
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their 
fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 
50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this 
proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities for the following reasons. (1) 
vessels will be able to obtain bridge openings on signal versus a four-
hour advance notice, (2) the remote operation system is designed to 
provide equal or greater capabilities compared to the on-site bridge 
tender, and (3) the bridge owner will be capable of restoring on-site 
operation of the bridge within 60 minutes if the remote operation 
system fails.
    If you think that your business, organization, or governmental 
jurisdiction qualifies as a small entity and that this rule would have 
a significant economic impact on it, please submit a comment (see 
ADDRESSES) explaining why you think it qualifies and how and to what 
degree this rule would economically affect it.
    Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we want to assist small 
entities in understanding this proposed rule. If the proposed rule 
would affect your small business, organization, or governmental 
jurisdiction and you have questions concerning its provisions or 
options for compliance, please contact the person listed in the FOR 
FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section. The Coast Guard will not retaliate 
against small entities that question or complain about this proposed 
rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.

B. Collection of Information

    This proposed rule would call for no new collection of information 
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520.).

C. Federalism and Indian Tribal Governments

    A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132 
(Federalism), if it has a substantial direct effect on the States, on 
the relationship between the National Government and the States, or on 
the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels 
of government. We have analyzed this proposed rule under that Order and 
have determined that it is consistent with the fundamental federalism 
principles and preemption requirements described in Executive Order 
13132.
    Also, this proposed rule does not have tribal implications under 
Executive Order 13175 (Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments) because it would not have a substantial direct effect on 
one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal 
Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. If 
you believe this proposed rule has implications for federalism or 
Indian tribes, please contact the person listed in the FOR FURTHER 
INFORMATION CONTACT section.

D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) 
requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary 
regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may 
result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in 
the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for 
inflation) or more in any one year. Though this proposed rule will not 
result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this 
proposed rule elsewhere in this preamble.

E. Environment

    We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security 
Management Directive 023-01, Rev.1, associated implementing 
instructions, and Environmental Planning Policy COMDTINST 5090.1 
(series), which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f). The 
Coast Guard has determined that this action is one of a category of 
actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant 
effect on the human environment. This proposed rule promulgates the 
operating regulations or procedures for drawbridges. Normally such 
actions are categorically excluded from further review, under paragraph 
L49, of Appendix A, Table 1 of DHS Instruction Manual 023-01-001-01, 
Rev. 1.
    Neither a Record of Environmental Consideration nor a Memorandum 
for the Record are required for this rule. We seek any comments or 
information that may lead to the discovery of a significant 
environmental impact from this proposed rule.
