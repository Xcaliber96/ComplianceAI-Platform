National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

49 CFR Parts 563 and 585

[Docket No. NHTSA-2025-0050]
RIN 2127-AM78


Event Data Recorders

AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 
Department of Transportation (DOT).

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM); response to petitions for 
reconsideration.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: NHTSA published a final rule on December 18, 2024, in response 
to a mandate of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST 
Act) to establish the appropriate recording period in NHTSA's Event 
Data Recorder (EDR) regulation (49 CFR part 563). The final rule 
amended the pre-crash data capture requirements of EDRs by increasing 
the recording duration and sample rate from 5 seconds at 2 Hz to 20 
seconds at 10 Hz. The agency received three petitions for 
reconsideration from the Alliance of Automotive Innovation, the EDR 
Committee of SAE International, and FCA US LLC (a subsidiary of 
Stellantis N.V.) in response to the final rule. NHTSA is proposing to 
delay the compliance date from September 1, 2027, to September 1, 2028, 
and implement a phase-in period for EDRs to meet the new requirements.

DATES: Comments must be received by December 29, 2025. In compliance 
with the Paperwork Reduction Act, NHTSA is also seeking comment on a 
reinstatement with modification to a previously approved information 
collection. For additional information, see the Paperwork Reduction Act 
section under the Rulemaking Analyses and Notices section below. All 
comments relating to the information collection requirements should be 
submitted to NHTSA and to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) at 
the address listed in the ADDRESSES section on or before December 29, 
2025.
    Proposed Compliance Dates: NHTSA proposes delaying the compliance 
date and adopting a 4-year phase-in period to comply with the 
requirements in 49 CFR part 563 as amended by the final rule published 
on December 18, 2024, final rule, ``Event Data Recorders.'' The 
proposal would require that 25 percent of a manufacturer's applicable 
vehicles produced from September 1, 2028, to August 31, 2029, comply 
with Part 563, followed by 50 percent from September 1, 2029, to August 
31, 2030, 75 percent from September 1, 2030, to August 31, 2031, and 
100 percent on and after September 1, 2031. NHTSA also proposes that 
vehicles manufactured in two or more stages or that are altered are not 
required to comply with the rule until on or after September 1, 2031. 
Small-volume and limited-line manufacturers would be required to comply 
beginning on September 1, 2032. The proposal would permit voluntary 
early compliance.

I. Executive Summary

    In this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), NHTSA responds to 
petitions for reconsideration of a final rule published December 18, 
2024, that amended the data capture requirements

[[Page 54620]]

of event data recorders (EDRs) to specify a 20-second recording 
duration and a 10 Hz sample rate.\1\ The primary purpose of an EDR is 
to record technical information for a brief period before, during, and 
after a collision, aiding in post-crash analysis and reconstruction. 
The data recorded by the EDR provides a snapshot of the vehicle 
dynamics that can aid crash investigators in assessing the performance 
of specific safety equipment, including air bag deployment strategies, 
air bag operation, and event severity. This information can also help 
NHTSA and others identify potential opportunities for safety 
improvements in current and future vehicles and implement more 
effective safety regulations. Manufacturers are not required to install 
EDRs in their vehicles. However, EDRs that are voluntarily installed 
must meet the requirements NHTSA has established in 49 CFR part 563 
(Part 563).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 89 FR 102810 (December 18, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NHTSA received three petitions for reconsideration of the December 
2024 final rule from the Alliance of Automotive Innovation (Auto 
Innovators),\2\ the EDR Committee of SAE International (SAE),\3\ and 
FCA U.S. LLC (FCA), a subsidiary of Stellantis N.V.\4\ NHTSA is 
granting the petitions for reconsideration in part and proposing to 
adopt the compliance timeline requested by both SAE and Auto Innovators 
in their respective petitions. This modified timeline would provide 
manufacturers with an extended lead time and a phase-in to allow them 
to integrate the necessary EDR and Airbag Control Module (ACM) \5\ 
architecture changes within their current model development cycles 
without disrupting existing product plans. The agency's proposal 
balances the need for enhanced crash data, as mandated by the FAST Act, 
with practical industry constraints to ensure these safety advancements 
can be implemented effectively across the entire vehicle fleet. 
However, NHTSA is not proposing to adjust the recording duration and 
sample rate requirements for EDRs as finalized in the December 2024 
final rule. These technical specifications represent enhancements to 
vehicle crash data collection capabilities that will support more 
comprehensive crash investigations. NHTSA is deferring a final decision 
on reconsideration until after review of comments received in response 
to this NPRM.

in the petitions for reconsideration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NHTSA is proposing to extend the lead time for initial compliance 
with the requirements of the December 18, 2024, rule by one year from 
September 1, 2027, to September 1, 2028. In addition, NHTSA proposes 
adding a phase-in period that would require 25 percent of a 
manufacturer's fleet equipped with EDRs to be compliant with the 
requirements of the final rule beginning in the first year of 
compliance, and an additional 25 percent each year after that, until 
the fleet is fully compliant in the fourth year. This matches the lead 
time and phase-in period suggested in the petitions received from Auto 
Innovators and SAE. We seek comment on all aspects of this proposal.

II. Background

A. Event Data Recorders and Part 563

    NHTSA established Part 563 on August 28, 2006, setting forth 
requirements for the accuracy, collection, storage, survivability, and 
retrievability of data in vehicles equipped with EDRs. NHTSA does not 
mandate EDRs on vehicles, but, if vehicles are equipped with EDRs, the 
EDRs must meet specific data capture requirements as outlined in Tables 
I-III of Part 563. Table I lists 15 data elements all EDRs subject to 
Part 563 are required to record, along with the recording interval 
(duration) and data sample rate. Table II lists optional data elements 
that EDRs are not required to capture, but if recorded, are subject to 
the recording interval (duration) and sample rate for each listed data 
element in Table II.\6\ All data elements in Tables I and II must be 
reported according to the range, accuracy, and resolution in Table III 
of Part 563. Since Part 563 became fully effective on September 1, 
2012, the adoption of EDRs has been nearly universal. NHTSA's internal 
analysis estimates 99.5 percent of model year 2021 passenger cars and 
other vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 3,855 
kilograms (kg) (8,500 pounds) or less are equipped with EDRs that 
comply with Part 563.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Two data elements in Table II are listed as ``if equipped,'' 
meaning if a vehicle has the specified equipment, the specified 
information must be recorded.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    EDRs are often integrated into a vehicle's ACM, the electronic 
system used to determine the deployment timing for air bags. EDRs 
record data related to restraints and deployment internal to the ACM, 
often at or just after a triggering event, referred to as crash data. 
EDRs also record data from other existing vehicle sensors such as wheel 
speed or accelerator pedal position that is transferred from the 
vehicle's other onboard computers (electronic control units or ECUs) to 
the ACM via controller area network (CAN) or similar communication. The 
EDR temporarily stores this pre-crash data in a buffer. When a 
triggering event occurs, pre-crash and crash data are stored in non-
volatile memory, so it survives even if the vehicle battery is damaged 
or disconnected in the crash. This data can include vehicle speed, 
throttle position, brake application, steering angle, seatbelt use, and 
air bag deployment timing. If a vehicle is equipped with an EDR, it 
must contain at a minimum the data outlined in Table I of Part 563, but 
manufacturers can add additional data elements at their discretion. The 
required pre-crash data elements in Table I include: (1) speed, vehicle 
indicated; (2) engine throttle, percent full (or accelerator pedal, 
percent full); and (3) service brake, on/off. The storage size of this 
data is considered small, often just kilobytes, because the EDR only 
stores a short interval of data around the time of a triggering event.

B. Rulemaking Actions

    On June 22, 2022, pursuant to section 24303 of the Fixing America's 
Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act), Public Law 114-94 (December 4, 
2015), NHTSA issued an NPRM to amend Part 563.\7\ The NPRM relied on 
the findings of an EDR Duration Study \8\ required by the FAST Act and 
information gathered from NHTSA's defects investigation experience 
which indicated that EDR data can be used to assess whether a vehicle 
operated properly at the time of an event, or to help detect 
undesirable operations. The June 2022 NPRM proposed extending the 
recording interval and data sample rate of pre-crash data elements 
under Part 563 from 5 seconds at 2 Hz to 20 seconds at 10 Hz (i.e., an 
increase from 2 samples per second to 10 samples per second).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 87 FR 37289 (June 22, 2022).
    \8\ Event Data Recorder Duration Study [Appendix to a Report to 
Congress. Report No. DOT HS 813 082B], 2022, <a href="https://doi.org/10.21949/1530244">https://doi.org/10.21949/1530244</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NHTSA explained in the June 2022 NPRM that extending the recording 
duration from 5 to 20 seconds would help capture critical data on the 
initiation of pre-crash actions and maneuvers for most crashes. The 
June 2022 NPRM acknowledged the proposed changes could result in 
additional costs, as more memory would be required to store the 
increased amount of pre-crash data. However, the agency explained the

[[Page 54621]]

additional memory could be incorporated into the existing or planned 
memory design in vehicles, based on the relatively small amount of 
memory necessary to record the pre-crash data for 20 seconds at 10 
Hz.\9\ NHTSA proposed an effective date of the first September 1 one 
year after the publication of the final rule, noting that a one-year 
lead time was appropriate because increasing the required pre-crash 
data would not require any additional hardware or a substantial 
redesign of either the EDR or the vehicle and would likely require only 
minimal software changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ NHTSA estimated that an increase in pre-crash recording 
duration from 5 seconds to 20 seconds with an increase in recording 
frequency from 2 Hz to 10 Hz would require 1.33 Kb of additional 
memory for one event.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    After reviewing comments submitted in response to the June 2022 
NPRM, NHTSA published a final rule on December 18, 2024, that increased 
the pre-crash recording duration and sample rate requirements of the 
seven pre-crash data elements in Part 563 from 5 seconds to 20 seconds, 
as proposed.\10\ Per the statutory mandate of the FAST Act, the 
December 2024 final rule aimed to establish the appropriate period for 
EDRs to capture and record vehicle-related data to provide sufficient 
information to investigate the cause of motor vehicle crashes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ Three data elements are included in Table I of part 563 as 
mandatory elements to be recorded if an EDR is equipped. Four data 
elements are included in Table II of part 563 as having to meet 
certain requirements if they are recorded by the EDR.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NHTSA explained in the December 2024 final rule that the increased 
recording duration will provide more details on actions taken prior to 
crashes. Specifically, vehicle actions such as running a stop sign or 
red light could be captured in full and included in crash 
reconstruction when supplemented with roadway and traffic control 
information. The increased recording duration could also help capture 
any corrective maneuvers taken by a vehicle prior to an initial road 
departure or braking and acceleration actions taken in the approach 
stage before traversing large intersections. NHTSA explained that the 
increased sample rate will help clarify the interpretation of pre-crash 
data, including braking and steering actions taken by the vehicle, 
especially in situations where an action occurs just prior to impact 
(between 0.5 seconds prior to impact and the time of impact). The 
agency also noted that this could both help reduce potential 
uncertainty related to the relative timing of recorded data elements 
and assist with the identification of potential pedal misapplication. 
The compliance date set by NHTSA for the December 2024 final rule was 
September 1, 2027, for vehicles equipped with an EDR. Small-volume or 
limited-line manufacturers were given until September 1, 2029, to 
comply, and altered or multi-stage manufacturers were given until 
September 1, 2030, to comply.

III. Summary of Petitions for Reconsideration

    NHTSA regulations allow any interested person to petition the 
Administrator for reconsideration of a rule. Under NHTSA's regulations, 
petitions for reconsideration must provide an explanation why 
compliance with the rule is not practicable, is unreasonable, or is not 
in the public interest. In addition, petitions must be received within 
45 days of the publication of the final rule. The Administrator may 
consolidate petitions relating to the same rule. The Administrator may 
issue a final decision on reconsideration without further proceedings 
or may provide opportunity for comment.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ 49 CFR 553.35, 553.37.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The agency received three petitions for reconsideration in response 
to the December 2024 final rule from Auto Innovators, SAE, and FCA.\12\ 
In its petition, Auto Innovators stated that the changes to the pre-
crash recording period and sample rate lack sufficient evidence of 
safety benefits and impose significant implementation burdens. The 
petition from Auto Innovators raised three main concerns. First, the 
petition stated that NHTSA's reliance on the EDR Duration Study in the 
December 2024 final rule without fully addressing comments to the June 
2022 NPRM was inadequate.\13\ Second, the petition claimed that the 
two-year lead time in the final rule (compliance date of September 1, 
2027) underestimated the complexity of changing the hardware and 
software for EDRs. The petition disputed NHTSA's claim that many EDRs 
can meet the new requirements with minor changes, citing needs for 
increased memory, energy, and redesigned components, which could strain 
supply chains and vehicle production cycles. Third, Auto Innovators 
stated that NHTSA's analysis in the December 2024 final rule 
oversimplified the costs of compliance by focusing on component-level 
upgrades (e.g., capacitors, memory) and did not adequately consider 
broader redesign, validation, and recertification expenses for existing 
and late-stage development vehicles. The petition stated that capacitor 
size estimates differed by a factor of approximately 1,000 and that any 
changes to the number of capacitors could impact the vehicle 
architecture or onboard computers. Regarding crash data retrieval (CDR) 
tools, Part 563 mandates that manufacturers ensure commercially 
available tools for EDR data access and retrieval within 90 days of a 
vehicle's first sale if the vehicle is equipped with an EDR. 49 CFR 
563.12. Auto Innovators highlighted the unaddressed cost, complexity, 
and lead time for updating CDR tools for all manufacturers within the 
90-day window, especially without a phase-in period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ NHTSA-2024-0084-0005 (Auto Innovators), NHTSA-2024-0084-
0004 (SAE), and NHTSA-2024-0084-0003 (FCA).
    \13\ Auto Innovators and SAE in response to the June 2022 NPRM 
critiqued aspects of the EDR Duration Study, including the model 
year of the vehicles, the small set of data elements, and the basis 
for concluding that 20 seconds of pre-crash data enhances crash 
analysis beyond the previous requirement of 5 seconds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Auto Innovators sought a revised rule that balances safety goals 
with practical implementation to maintain the current level of EDR 
implementation. The petitioner suggested a three-year lead time with a 
four-year phase-in (25/50/75/100 percent). NHTSA understands this 
suggestion to mean the first September 1 that is three years from the 
publication of the December 2024 final rule. Auto Innovators requested 
that NHTSA reassess the feasibility and benefits of the December 2024 
final rule and conduct a more thorough cost-benefit analysis with 
industry input. It also urged alignment with international 
standards.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ UN ECE No. 160 maintains the 5 seconds/2 Hz minimum 
requirements for pre-crash recorded data elements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    SAE stated that the December 2024 final rule is impractical, 
unreasonable, and not in the public interest. SAE noted that it 
advocates for the use of EDRs as tools for crash reconstruction, not 
driver behavior monitoring devices, and stated that the prior 
requirements (5 seconds at 2 Hz) are sufficient. SAE stated that 20 
seconds of pre-crash data captures speculative actions unrelated to 
crash causation, posing risks of privacy violations and misleading 
reconstructions without crash-site evidence. SAE disputed NHTSA's 
reliance on the EDR Duration Study, asserting that no evidence supports 
the benefit of longer data capture durations. Regarding CDR tools, 
while most manufacturers use Bosch CDR products,\15\ SAE stated that 
due to the

[[Page 54622]]

complicated connection and interface requirements for each 
manufacturer, Bosch would have to develop new software and possibly all 
new interfaces and software to read EDR data. SAE asserted this 
development process will be further complicated by longer imaging times 
for each device due to the increased amount of EDR data.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ In comments on the June 2022 NPRM, Bosch suggested 
exempting older, soon-to-be discontinued models from the amendments, 
arguing that capturing new vehicle technologies is more beneficial 
than extending recording duration. While supporting a sample rate 
increase to 10 Hz for better capture events such as braking, 
steering, and lane change maneuvers, Bosch noted that even this 
change alone would require software and hardware modifications.
    \16\ SAE notes there are currently 22 manufacturers and 55 
brands supported worldwide by the tool, and these changes would 
require a substantial workload. SAE mentions that other EDR data 
collection tool suppliers (e.g., GIT) would be negatively impacted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    SAE also stated that a two-year timeline is inadequate and would 
require manufacturers to implement extensive hardware and software 
updates and perform rigorous testing and validation, and could prompt 
manufacturers to disable EDRs, thus undermining safety goals. SAE 
recommended retaining the previous recording requirements or adopting a 
phase-in and hosting a workshop to assess manufacturer needs if the new 
recording requirements are maintained. SAE also questioned NHTSA's cost 
justification process under the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
guidelines, requesting related documentation and cited the cost 
estimates provided by Auto Innovators in response to the June 2022 
NPRM.\17\ SAE recommended that NHTSA reconsider the final rule, citing 
minimal societal benefit, privacy risks, and industry burdens. SAE also 
requested a three-year lead time with a four-year phase-in (25/50/75/
100 percent).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ Auto Innovators estimated the cost burden for the initial 
year would be $231.36 million. That estimate is $8.4 million per 
manufacturer (for 17 manufacturers) for development and testing plus 
the incremental EDR module cost ($5.40) times the number of vehicles 
fitted in that year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FCA's petition stated that it supports the goal of extending the 
EDR capture and recording period but that the two-year lead time is 
impractical to implement. FCA explained that the design changes 
necessary to update their EDRs do not align with existing product 
plans, necessitating costly, expedited investments. FCA asserted that a 
more gradual timeline would reduce costs significantly, potentially to 
zero, by aligning with standard industry product lifecycles. FCA 
suggested a 4-year phase-in as follows: September 1, 2027: 25 percent 
compliance; September 1, 2028: 50 percent compliance; September 1, 
2029: 75 percent compliance; September 1, 2030: 100 percent compliance. 
FCA stated that this timeline would allow current vehicle models to be 
phased out under existing rules while new models adopt the updated 
standards, enabling cost-effective validation through crash tests. FCA 
stated that removing EDR functionality due to timeline pressures would 
not align with its safety and transparency goals as it remains 
committed to maintaining EDR technology. FCA emphasized that EDRs aid 
post-crash analysis rather than directly saving lives.

IV. Discussion and Analysis

    NHTSA is proposing to grant the petitions in part by extending the 
lead time and implementing a phase-in schedule to align the changes 
made to EDRs more closely with the production life cycles of vehicles. 
The added lead time and phase-in period aims to ease the financial 
burden associated with the testing and development stages necessary to 
validate the EDR functions as intended and not compromise performance 
of the air bag deployment systems. The three petitions expressed 
concerns with the following general areas of the final rule: lead time, 
costs and benefits, estimate of hardware and software changes, basis 
for recording duration, industry standards, and CDR development. The 
sections below examine each topic in turn, discussing the petitions and 
explaining the agency's response.

A. Lead Time and Phase-In Schedule

Lead Time
    Auto Innovators, SAE, and FCA stated that the final rule's 
compliance date (September 1, 2027) is impractical, forcing a redesign 
of current EDRs and electrical systems across all vehicle models. They 
recommended a phase-in schedule: Auto Innovators and SAE suggested an 
additional year of lead time (a total of three years of lead time) 
followed by a four-year phase-in (25/50/75/100 percent), while FCA 
suggested a four-year phase-in (25/50/75/100 percent) starting from the 
rule's compliance date (a total of two years of lead time).\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ The final rule required all vehicles equipped with an EDR 
to meet the new requirements beginning two years following the first 
September 1 after publication. Because the final rule was published 
in December 2024 the compliance date was set as September 1, 2027.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NHTSA has tentatively determined that the implementation timeline 
for the December 2024 final rule may create unnecessary redesign and 
validation costs, especially with regards to late-stage design and in-
market vehicles, and may risk some such vehicles no longer being 
equipped with EDRs. Therefore, the agency is proposing to amend Part 
563 by extending the lead time by one year and adding the phase-in 
period suggested by Auto Innovators and SAE in their petitions for 
reconsideration. This option is being proposed in part because, based 
on the cost estimates below, the extra year of lead time compared to 
the schedule suggested by FCA would reduce costs further. This option 
is also being proposed to lower the risk that NHTSA and a wide range of 
stakeholders could lose access to valuable EDR data. Since Part 563 is 
an ``if equipped'' standard, manufacturers retain discretion over 
whether to install EDRs in vehicles, provided any EDRs that are 
installed on light vehicles required to have frontal air bags comply 
with the regulation's requirements. If some manufacturers determine 
that costs or technical issues involved in bringing certain models into 
compliance with the requirements in the December 2024 final rule 
outweigh the benefits of including EDRs, they may discontinue EDR 
installation.
    NHTSA's December 2024 final rule set an effective date of September 
1, 2027. The approximately two years and eight months provided more 
implementation flexibility than the June 2022 NPRM's proposed one-year 
lead time. This decision was partially based on manufacturer feedback 
suggesting some EDRs already had the memory, energy, and processing 
power for capturing 20 seconds of pre-crash data at 10 Hz. NHTSA did 
acknowledge that even EDRs with the capability to record 20 seconds of 
pre-crash data would require testing and validation to ensure 
compliance and to prevent interference with air bag timing. However, 
NHTSA admitted that it lacked the data to estimate how many EDRs in the 
current vehicle fleet possess the necessary hardware for the new 
requirements, given adequate time for software changes and system 
validation.
    The agency acknowledges that manufacturers may have insufficient 
time to adopt in full the new requirements which could force limiting 
some of their EDR functionality. As highlighted in the petitions, the 
development cycle and installation of EDRs can span three to four 
years, and manufacturers may have already finalized EDRs for model 
years 2026 through 2030, making immediate changes costly.
    Therefore, to lower the risk that NHTSA and a wide range of 
stakeholders could lose access to valuable EDR data due to burdensome 
cost and redesign constraints imposed

[[Page 54623]]

by the December 2024 final rule's original timeline, NHTSA proposes to 
extend the lead time and add a phase-in schedule for vehicles equipped 
with EDRs to meet the pre-crash recording requirements. The agency did 
not intend for manufacturers to remove EDR functionality and did not 
suggest manufacturers remove EDRs to meet the requirements in the 
December 2024 final rule. NHTSA anticipates that a phase-in schedule 
would allow manufacturers to implement the necessary EDR and ACM 
architecture changes in existing model development cycles. This 
approach also ensures the agency's continued collection of valuable 
data from vehicles with EDRs that do not yet meet the new requirements.
    The phase-in schedule, excluding small volume and multi-stage 
manufacturers, would be as follows for vehicles equipped with EDRs:
    <bullet> 25 percent of the vehicles manufactured on or after 
September 1, 2028, and before September 1, 2029.
    <bullet> 50 percent of the vehicles manufactured on or after 
September 1, 2029, and before September 1, 2030.
    <bullet> 75 percent of the vehicles manufactured on or after 
September 1, 2030, and before September 1, 2031.
    <bullet> 100 percent of the vehicles manufactured on or after 
September 1, 2031.
    Small-volume manufacturers and multi-stage manufacturers would not 
be subject to the phase-in. Small-volume manufacturers would have an 
additional year to comply, and multi-stage manufacturers and alterers 
would have two additional years. As proposed, the requirements would 
apply beginning September 1, 2032, to small-volume manufacturers or 
limited-line manufacturers and September 1, 2033, for vehicles 
manufactured by manufacturers producing altered vehicles or vehicles in 
two or more stages.
Cost Savings Associated With This Proposed Rule
    In developing this response to the petitions, NHTSA analyzed 
potential cost savings from different lead time extensions and phase-in 
schedules. Table 1 summarizes societal cost saving based on a three-
year phase-in with a one-year lead time extension. The proposed lead 
time and phase-in (one-year extension followed by 25/50/75/100 percent 
phase-in) means the first model year (MY) impacted by the final rule 
would apply to consumers purchasing new MY2029 vehicles. The phase-in 
would begin on September 1, 2028, with 25 percent compliance of 
vehicles between September 1, 2028, and August 31, 2029, increasing to 
50 percent and 75 percent in the following years, and 100 percent after 
August 31, 2031. This phase-in is projected to save $9.95 to $25.14 
million in 2028, $6.63 to $16.76 million in 2029, and $3.32 to $8.38 
million in 2030. The lead time extension itself is projected to save an 
additional $13.26 to $33.52 million in 2027, resulting in total 
quantified savings of $33.15 to $83.80 million from 2027 to 2030. When 
discounting at three percent, the cost savings is approximately $29.77 
million to $75.23 million. When discounting at seven percent, the cost 
savings is approximately $25.95 million to $65.57 million.
    In comments to the June 2022 NPRM and the petitions addressed in 
this document, manufacturers documented significant implementation 
costs associated with the mandatory updates to EDRs across their 
vehicle fleets. The estimates from Auto Innovators indicated that mid-
cycle engineering modifications would require an estimated $231.36 
million in redesign expenditures in the first year followed by $88.56 
in subsequent years. The additional lead time and phase-in schedule 
would enable manufacturers to integrate compliant EDRs into their 
standard development timelines, eliminating the need for costly 
expedited engineering solutions. NHTSA's conservative estimate of 
$33.15 million to $83.80 million in quantified savings represents only 
the direct costs avoided through this approach to extend the lead time 
and offer a phase-in. The agency does not have the information to 
estimate the additional cost savings from manufacturers not having to 
make substantial design changes to vehicle models in the middle of 
their production cycle. Manufacturers may find further unquantifiable 
savings through flexibility and technological advancements, allowing 
them to phase out older EDRs lacking the necessary capabilities to 
record for 20 seconds at 10 Hz without requiring extensive 
modifications. For example, NHTSA anticipates that emerging storage 
technologies could replace Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only 
Memory (EEPROM), currently a common method for recording EDR data. 
These newer technologies would allow data to be written to non-volatile 
memory more quickly than EEPROM, potentially reducing the reserve power 
needed if the vehicle battery fails during the data recording process. 
If manufacturers determine that alternatives like flash memory or 
ferroelectric random-access memory (FRAM) are suitable for EDRs and 
cost-effective solutions, the implementation costs may decrease. In 
addition, as technology advances, manufacturers can expect either 
reduced prices for existing memory components or increased storage 
capacity at comparable price points, without significantly increasing 
the physical size of EDR modules.

B. Cost Estimates

    The petitioners raised several issues with the cost analysis in the 
December 2024 final rule. Broadly, petitioners raised issues with the 
component hardware and software cost estimates NHTSA used, such as an 
inadequate estimate of the changes to the amount of memory and reserve 
power that would be needed, the costs associated with additional 
validation and testing needed to meet the new requirements, and the 
component estimates in the final regulatory evaluation (FRE) \19\ 
supplementing the December 2024 final rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ NHTSA-2024-0084-0002.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NHTSA is not adjusting its cost estimates with regard to hardware 
and software changes in response to the petitions. It is not clear from 
the Auto Innovators' petition what aspect of the December 2024 final 
rule petitioners are requesting be amended if such a change in cost 
estimates is made. Nonetheless, the agency previously underestimated 
the amount of time some manufacturers would need to design, test, and 
validate EDRs after implementing hardware and software changes. The 
proposed additional lead time and phase-in period should alleviate the 
financial burden associated with manufacturers having to upgrade EDRs 
across their models. It may also allow manufacturers to increase the 
amount of non-volatile memory and RAM, if needed, and validate the 
correct transfer rates and frequencies of the required data (Table I 
elements). It would also allow manufacturers to assess whether more 
reserve energy is necessary to write the increased amount of data 
within the EDR or additional reserve energy sources for maintaining 
power for other vehicle systems after a triggering event. Furthermore, 
this proposed extended period may facilitate the testing and 
development of newer, faster data processing and writing technologies, 
potentially reducing the reserve energy needed for reliable data 
capture.
    Regarding the component hardware itself, NHTSA estimated in the 
June 2022 NPRM and December 2024 final rule that the amount of memory 
required to meet the new requirements would increase from 0.90 kB to 
2.26 kB per event, not accounting for necessary memory buffers. While 
the June 2022 NPRM initially anticipated near-zero costs based solely 
on memory upgrades, the December 2024 final rule's analysis was updated 
to account for EDRs lacking sufficient hardware to accommodate the 
increased data. This revised cost analysis included incremental 
expenses for upgrading all hardware components necessary for buffering 
and writing the data to non-volatile memory. Feedback indicated many 
manufacturers use flash memory (standalone or in microcontrollers) with 
capacities up to 96 kB to capture EDR data. A few manufacturers are 
recording pre-crash data at 10 Hz (but not for 20 seconds) while many 
already capture pre-crash data elements not listed as required data 
elements to capture in Table I of Part 563. Based on the estimated data 
increase of 1.33 kB per event, NHTSA continues to believe manufacturers 
either have sufficient memory in a subset of their EDRs or can develop 
EDRs with more memory, if needed, to capture 20 seconds of data given 
enough time to test and develop EDRs.
    Based on the amount of data to be recorded with the extended 
duration and the current amount of memory available in EDRs (32 Kb to 
96 Kb), NHTSA did not anticipate a need for more reserve power in the 
December 2024 final rule and has not received information to change 
this assumption in the NPRM. Another study on EDRs published by NHTSA 
(referred to as the EDR Technologies Study in the NPRM and 2024 Final 
Rule) \20\ showed a decade-long trend of manufacturers moving from 
EEPROM to flash memory, which should reduce the amount of time 
necessary to write the data and consequently the reserve energy needed 
to complete the writing process. Manufacturers had indicated to NHTSA 
that some EDR modules already possess the hardware capabilities (in 
terms of memory, power, and controller specifications) to meet the new 
requirements. Therefore, NHTSA is not adjusting its cost estimates for 
hardware and software changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ DOT HS 812 929.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NHTSA is not altering the component-level costs presented in the 
FRE supplementing the December 2024 final rule. The agency provided a 
cost range ($13.26 million to $33.52 million annually) based on the 
hardware specification of two EDR platforms to meet the new Part 563 
requirements, which were components selected to meet the AEC-Q200 
standard. NHTSA is addressing an error in the analysis, however, that 
the FRE should have used ``mF'' (millifarad) instead of ``[mu]F'' 
(microfarad) as the standard unit of capacitors. The agency's cost 
estimates have therefore been revised to include upgrading from a 3.3-
mF capacitor to a 6.8-mF capacitor. The average unit prices, after a 70 
percent discount, were $0.24 for 3.3-mF capacitors (based on 24 quotes) 
and $0.26 for 6.8-mF capacitors (based on 13 quotes), resulting in a 
$0.02 difference, consistent with the component-level upgrade cost 
presented in the FRE.

C. Basis for December 2024 Final Rule and Benefits

    The petitions from Auto Innovators and SAE critiqued the EDR 
Duration Study that NHTSA used to justify extending the recording 
duration and criticized NHTSA discussion in the June 2022 NPRM and 
December 2024 final rule of the benefits of the increased amount of EDR 
pre-crash data.\21\ Auto Innovators requested that NHTSA reconsider the 
EDR duration and frequency specifications and examine the possibility 
that similar safety benefits can be attained through less burdensome 
requirements. SAE requested that NHTSA retain the prior 5-second 
duration and 2-Hz recording frequency for pre-crash data elements or 
adopt a phase-in schedule for manufacturers to meet the new EDR 
requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ Auto Innovators and SAE offered similar comments in 
response to the June 2022 NPRM (87 FR 37289).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NHTSA is not proposing to amend these aspects of Part 563. Auto 
Innovators claims NHTSA has not demonstrated the potential safety 
benefits of the extended recording duration. However, Congress mandated 
NHTSA conduct a study to determine an appropriate recording duration 
for providing sufficient information to investigate the cause of motor 
vehicle crashes. Following the submission of this study's findings, the 
FAST Act required NHTSA to issue a final rule. The June 2022 NPRM and 
December 2024 Final Rule extensively detail the benefits of increasing 
the recording duration.
    The fundamental purpose of Part 563 is to ensure EDRs record data 
``valuable for effective crash investigations and for analysis of 
safety equipment performance.'' The EDR Duration Study's findings 
clearly indicate that the current 5-second pre-crash recording duration 
under Part 563 fails to capture the initiation of pre-crash braking and 
steering maneuvers in a significant number of cases. The study showed 
that extending the pre-crash recording duration would capture a greater 
amount of information regarding a vehicle's actions leading up to a 
triggering event, thereby increasing the value of EDR data for crash 
investigations. Based on these findings, a 20-second recording duration 
is necessary to ensure that the initiation of

[[Page 54625]]

pre-crash actions and crash avoidance maneuvers are captured for the 
majority of crashes. This recording duration will increase the utility 
of the recorded information, potentially leading to further 
advancements in the safety of both current and future vehicles. 
Furthermore, the study concluded that a more comprehensive 
understanding of pre-crash actions will aid in the evaluation of crash 
avoidance systems (such as lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, 
forward collision avoidance, automatic emergency braking, and 
intersection safety assistance systems), even if specific data from 
these systems is not directly reported by the EDR.
    The EDR Duration Study aimed to identify the necessary recording 
duration for investigating crash causation. The study was not directed 
to prove that increasing the recording duration of EDR data would 
increase safety or to estimate the cost of design changes associated 
with extending the recording duration. NHTSA believes the study 
provides a robust basis for increasing the recording duration to 20 
seconds based on the study's finding that a 5-second window often 
misses significant pre-crash actions, particularly for road departure 
and intersection crashes. The study showed that 5 seconds is 
insufficient to capture crucial information, such as the initiation of 
crash avoidance maneuvers like braking and steering, in a considerable 
percentage of crashes where EDRs are triggered. For example, the study 
demonstrated that approximately 35 percent of drivers that applied 
brakes did so outside of the 5-second window prior to impact. The 
actions of the vehicles captured beyond 5 seconds would assist 
investigators with crash reconstruction. Moreover, the study indicated 
that 20 seconds would encompass the 90th percentile of recording 
duration needed for lane departure, intersection, and rear-end crashes.
    NHTSA acknowledges the vehicles used in the study lacked modern 
safety features that could have intervened within five seconds of the 
crash event. However, current regulations do not mandate that EDRs 
capture the status of active safety systems. While manufacturers may 
voluntarily record data on modern safety features in their EDRs, it 
could not be consistently included in the study. Consequently, the 
current five-second recording duration of most EDRs inherently 
restricts the ability to analyze crash causation beyond that timeframe. 
The study used the 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) and 
Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2) NDS because they contained 
data extending beyond five seconds, enabling researchers to analyze 
vehicle actions in rear-end crashes, lane departures, and the approach 
and traversal stages when passing through an intersection.
    The EDR Duration Study was conducted in two phases. Phase one used 
existing crash data from NHTSA's database to analyze how often the 
five-second EDR recording duration failed to capture the start of 
driver actions before crashes. This phase established that the five-
second requirement was inadequate and proved the need for longer 
recording durations. Phase two used naturalistic driving study data to 
examine the complete timeline of driver pre-crash actions (beyond five 
seconds pre-crash). Researchers used this real-world driving behavior 
data to determine what EDR recording duration would be needed to 
capture when drivers first began taking pre-crash actions. Phase two of 
the EDR Duration Study examined newer vehicles than the vehicles 
examined in Phase one. Though active safety features are not required 
to be recorded in EDRs, Phase two found that increased recording time 
could allow for more voluntary recording of active safety systems. The 
activation times for ABS in that data ranged from two to nine seconds 
before a crash, further demonstrating the inadequacy of a five-second 
recording duration to capture all relevant pre-crash vehicle dynamics. 
Moreover, understanding vehicle dynamics and driver behavior that occur 
before ABS activation is crucial for comprehensive crash causation 
analysis. These earlier timeframes can contain the initial decision 
points and driving patterns that precipitate the conditions leading to 
ABS engagement. Without this extended timeline data, investigators 
could miss critical information about steering and braking inputs, 
early avoidance maneuvers, and progressive system interventions that 
form the complete causal chain of events.
    The EDR Duration Study referred to driver ``behavior'' and 
``actions'' interchangeably. Literature has shown that crash causation 
is often related to driver error, so understanding a driver's actions 
pre-crash is crucial. Therefore, the study focused on the duration 
needed to capture a driver's actions pre-crash in full, which is within 
the scope of EDR data collection for effective crash investigation 
purposes. Consequently, the Phase two objective was precisely to 
determine a recording duration that enhances the certainty of capturing 
the complete timeline of pre-crash actions.
    NHTSA underscores that achieving the most accurate reconstruction 
of events triggering EDR recording necessitates the continued 
integration of all pertinent information alongside EDR data. When 
analyzing data more likely to represent normal driving behavior and 
less directly related to crash causation, the EDR Duration Study 
specifically examined actions preceding the event, such as changes in 
steady-state vehicle velocity and the earliest instances of braking. A 
finding from Phase two of the study was that a 20-second pre-crash data 
window would encompass the 90th percentile of the required recording 
duration for the analyzed crash modes (lane departure, intersection, 
and rear-end) and associated crash avoidance maneuvers.
    NHTSA emphasizes that the 20-second extended recording duration 
will be particularly beneficial in analyzing intersection crashes. 
These crashes typically involve an approach stage as the vehicle nears 
the intersection and a traversal stage in which the vehicle is exposed 
in the intersection. Based on the EDR Duration Study, extending the 
pre-crash recording duration to 20 seconds would capture approximately 
90 percent of all intersection events and nearly all braking scenarios, 
compared to less than one percent with the five-second recording 
duration. The extended duration, combined with the increased sample 
rate, would document the complete sequence of driver actions from 
initial accelerator release (occurring up to 12 seconds pre-crash) 
through brake application (up to 10 seconds pre-crash) to any evasive 
maneuvers. With typical intersection events lasting 10-19 seconds 
depending on the configuration, the longer duration would capture the 
entire approach and traversal phases. This EDR data would reveal the 
critical decision points across various intersection sizes and approach 
types (e.g., complete stops, low-speed rolling stops, high-speed 
rolling stops). Similarly, in road departure crashes, longer durations 
could capture more complete information on gradual lane departures and 
corrective steering or braking maneuvers initiated by the driver before 
the initial departure from the roadway. This extended duration could 
also prove valuable in analyzing events occurring on larger highways, 
potentially capturing the actions of a vehicle as it approaches a stop 
sign or a signaled intersection, even across multiple lanes.
    Regarding privacy concerns, NHTSA reaffirms that EDRs do not record 
personally identifiable information. The

[[Page 54626]]

data captured is routinely overwritten, preserving data only when 
specific crash events meet the defined trigger threshold in Part 563. 
Extending the pre-crash recording duration to 20 seconds is not 
anticipated to heighten privacy concerns, as it involves no new or 
significantly altered technology for collecting, storing, or 
disseminating personally identifiable information. Moreover, the Driver 
Privacy Act of 2015, enacted under the FAST Act after Part 563's 
establishment, legally designates the vehicle owner or lessee as the 
owner of EDR data. Retrieval of this recorded data is strictly limited 
to purposes of enhancing motor vehicle safety and safety research 
(provided the data remain non-personally identifiable), or with the 
explicit consent of the vehicle owner or through a lawful court or 
administrative order. These privacy protections should effectively 
address expressed concerns while enabling the agency to fulfill the 
FAST Act's mandate of establishing an appropriate recording period 
within NHTSA's EDR regulation.
    Auto Innovators and SAE stated that there will remain an ongoing 
need to collect supplementary data like police reports and ADAS event 
data for a more complete understanding of crash causation. NHTSA agrees 
that supplemental information (e.g., police reports) remains crucial 
for researchers, law enforcement, and reconstructionists to analyze 
vehicle and crash dynamics. However, NHTSA clarifies that the FAST 
Act's mandate specifically addressed pre-crash recording duration, not 
the addition of ADAS event data to be captured by EDRs. In response to 
SAE's caution against solely relying on EDR data, NHTSA emphasizes that 
the December 2024 final rule did not suggest abandoning the 
consideration of other critical factors in crash investigations. 
Instead, the increased data, coupled with a higher sample rate, aims to 
offer a more complete understanding of the pre-crash actions of the 
vehicle and their interplay. NHTSA is not mandating the inclusion of 
additional data elements beyond those listed in Part 563 at this time. 
However, the extended lead time and phase-in period proposed in this 
notice could present an opportunity for manufacturers to modernize the 
EDRs being equipped in their vehicles if they so choose. This timeframe 
may allow manufacturers the flexibility to develop and rigorously test 
EDR systems capable of capturing crucial information related to crash 
avoidance technologies and other ADAS like SAE Level 2 systems.\22\ 
This includes data that is already available within other existing ECUs 
onboard the vehicle, but that may not currently be recorded by the EDR. 
Notably, some manufacturers already equip vehicles with EDRs that 
capture status for systems like adaptive cruise control, automatic 
emergency braking, forward collision warning, and lane departure 
warning, which are all data elements beyond the current Part 563 
requirements. Manufacturers may voluntarily add data elements to be 
recorded by their EDRs, provided these additions do not compromise the 
EDR's ability to meet the minimum data capture requirements outlined in 
Part 563. This modernization could significantly enhance the richness 
and utility of EDR data for future safety research and analysis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ SAE Level 2 refers to features that provide steering and 
brake/acceleration support to the driver. An example would be lane 
centering and adaptive cruise control features functioning at the 
same time while the driver constantly supervises the support 
features to maintain safety.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Therefore, NHTSA is not proposing to amend the 20-second recording 
duration and 10 Hz sample rate requirements for EDRs as finalized in 
the December 2024 final rule.

D. Industry Standards

    In its petition, SAE asked for more information on the process 
associated with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. 
A-119 (Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary 
Consensus Standards and in Conformity Assessment Activities). SAE asked 
whether NHTSA sent any documentation to OMB in justification of the 
costs and the rationale per OMB's conformity assessment activities (per 
OMB A-119).\23\ SAE requested the agency to identify and share such 
documentation. Auto Innovators stated that NHTSA should have exercised 
discretion when implementing the FAST Act requirement and instead 
should have sought to align with established industry standards and 
international regulatory requirements more closely.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ In relevant part, OMB A-119 states, ``In those 
circumstances where an agency elects to use or develop a government 
unique standard in lieu of using a voluntary consensus standard, 
Section 12(d) of the NTTAA requires the agency to submit a report 
describing the reason(s) to OMB. Under the Circular, this report is 
submitted to OMB through the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST). For more information on reporting, see Sections 
9-11 of this Circular.'' Section 9 of OMB A-119 states, ``At 
minimum, your agency must have the ability to provide to OMB, 
through NIST, (1) a report on the agency's use of government-unique 
standards in lieu of voluntary consensus standards, along with an 
explanation of the reasons for such 33 usages, as required by 
Section 12(d) of the NTTAA and as described in Section 5c of this 
Circular; and (2) a summary of your agency's activities undertaken 
to carry out the provisions of this Circular.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NHTSA carefully considered the consensus standards applicable to 
EDR data elements in establishing Part 563 and in amending Part 563 in 
the December 2024 final rule.\24\ NHTSA declined to adopt the voluntary 
consensus standards for the pre-crash recording because such a decision 
would be inconsistent with the best available information to the agency 
and conflict with the outcome of a study required by the FAST Act. The 
factors the agency considered when implementing a conformity assessment 
program are discussed in the preamble to the December 2024 final rule 
with regards to the requirements of the National Technology Transfer 
and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA) (Pub. L. 104-113). These factors 
have not changed, and NHTSA declines to propose amending Part 563 
pursuant to align with industry consensus standards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ There are consensus standards related to EDRs, most notably 
standards published by SAE (J1698--Event Data Recorder), Institute 
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) (Standard 1616, IEEE 
Standard for Motor Vehicle Event Data Recorder) and UN Regulation 
No. 160 (which was followed by UN Regulation No. 160 Revision 1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With regards to material submitted pursuant to Circular A-119, the 
Circular A-119 annual report does not typically include rulemaking and 
decision information, such as costs. It identifies where NHTSA 
regulations incorporate a government-unique standard in lieu of an 
industry-developed voluntary consensus standard and explains the 
reasons for such usage.

E. CDR Development

    Part 563 mandates that manufacturers ensure commercially available 
tools for EDR data access and retrieval within 90 days of a vehicle's 
first sale if the vehicle is equipped with an EDR. 49 CFR 563.12. NHTSA 
acknowledges the concerns raised by Auto Innovators, SAE, and Bosch 
regarding EDR data accessibility. The additional lead time and phase-in 
proposed here should enable producers of EDR data retrieval tools to 
update, test, and validate their new products, including direct-to-
module cables, ensuring their capability to retrieve the EDR data 
effectively.

V. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices

Executive Orders 12866 and 14192

    This proposed rule does not meet the criteria of a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order (E.O.) 12866. Therefore, the 
Office of

[[Page 54627]]

Management and Budget (OMB) has not reviewed this proposed rule under 
that Executive Order.
    Under E.O. 14192, a deregulatory action is an action that has been 
finalized and has total costs less than zero. The rulemaking, if 
finalized as proposed, would be an E.O. 14192 deregulatory action.
    The requirements specified in the final rule provide benefits 
through the use of EDR data in crash defects investigations. However, 
the FRE was not able to quantify those benefits. The FRE accounted for 
the incremental costs associated with the final rule. Incremental costs 
reflect the increase in total lifetime cost for end users as a result 
of meeting the requirements specified in the final rule relative to 
costs incurred under the baseline. Therefore, the incremental costs 
reflected in the analysis are associated with upgrading currently 
compliant EDRs to meet the requirements specified in the final rule. 
Those incremental costs reflect hardware and software costs, as well as 
costs for redesign, validation, and labor. The FRE estimated that the 
incremental cost associated with the final rule ranged from 
approximately $13.26 million to $33.52 million in 2022 dollars.
    This rulemaking is a deregulatory action under E.O. 14192 because 
it would reduce the implementation burden associated with the December 
2024 final rule, which increased the pre-crash data recording duration 
and sample rate required under 49 CFR part 563. While the substantive 
requirements adopted in the December 2024 final rule remain unchanged, 
the agency is proposing to modify the compliance schedule in response 
to petitions for reconsideration that identified implementation 
challenges and risk of unintended consequences.
    Petitioners explained that the original compliance date imposed a 
rigid and accelerated timeline that did not align with typical vehicle 
development cycles. These conditions would have imposed high compliance 
costs, disrupted product planning, and could have resulted in the 
removal or disabling of EDR functionality in some vehicle models--
undermining the very safety objectives the rule was designed to 
advance. Quantified cost savings are discussed in more detail above, in 
Section IV.A. Also, as noted, the safety benefits of the December 2024 
final rule were unquantified. This was similar when NHTSA established 
Part 563. This was due to the difficulties in estimating both the exact 
portion of benefits creditable to an increased amount of EDR data after 
a standard is implemented or a safety countermeasure is developed and 
of quantifying how the benefits to safety research and emergency 
response translate to improved vehicle safety. Nonetheless, the agency 
acknowledges that it is likely the implementation timeline created a 
regulatory failure by imposing a disproportionate burden relative to 
those benefits, particularly for vehicle platforms in late-stage design 
or production. The agency seeks comment with information which may aid 
this determination. This proposed rule would correct that failure.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601-612) (as 
amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act 
(SBREFA) of 1996; 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), agencies must prepare and make 
available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis that 
describes the effect of the rule on small entities (i.e., small 
businesses, small organizations, and small government jurisdictions). 
No regulatory flexibility analysis is required, however, if the head of 
an agency or an appropriate designee certifies that the rule does not 
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. I certify that this rulemaking action would not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
The factual basis for this certification is provided below.
    The proposed delay in the compliance date and creation of a phase-
in period would reduce the burden on small entities by providing more 
time to comply with the new requirements. In addition, limited line 
\25\ and small-volume manufacturers \26\ would only need to produce 
vehicles with EDRs that meet the requirements, if the vehicle is 
equipped with an EDR, on or after September 1, 2032. Manufacturers 
producing altered vehicles or vehicles in two or more stages would have 
one additional year, until September 1, 2033, for compliance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ Limited line manufacturer means a manufacturer that sells 
three or fewer carlines, as that term is defined in 49 CFR 583.4, in 
the United States during a production year.
    \26\ Small-volume manufacturer as defined in Sec.  571.127, 
``Automatic emergency braking systems for light vehicles,'' is an 
original vehicle manufacturer that produces or assembles fewer than 
5,000 vehicles annually for sale in the United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NHTSA has concluded that this proposed rule would not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; 
therefore, an analysis is not included.

Executive Order 13132 (Federalism)

    NHTSA has examined this rule pursuant to E.O. 13132 (64 FR 43255, 
August 10, 1999) and concluded that no additional consultation with 
States, local governments, or their representatives is mandated beyond 
the rulemaking process. The agency has concluded that this rule does 
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant consultation 
with State and local officials or the preparation of a federalism 
summary impact statement. The rule does not have ``substantial direct 
effects on the States, on the relationship between the national 
government and the States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of government.''
    This proposed rule would amend an existing regulation. When 49 CFR 
part 563 was promulgated in 2006, NHTSA explained its view that any 
State laws or regulations that prohibit the types of EDRs addressed by 
Part 563 would create a conflict and therefore be preempted.\27\ As a 
result, regarding this proposed rule, NHTSA does not believe there are 
current State laws or regulations for EDRs that conflict with Part 563.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ The 2006 final rule promulgating 49 CFR part 563 discussed 
preemption at length. See 71 FR 50907, 51029 (August 28, 2006).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice Reform)

    With respect to the review of the promulgation of a new regulation, 
section 3(b) of E.O. 12988, ``Civil Justice Reform'' (61 FR 4729, 
February 7, 1996), requires that Executive agencies make every 
reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation: (1) clearly specifies 
the preemptive effect; (2) clearly specifies the effect on existing 
Federal law or regulation; (3) provides a clear legal standard for 
affected conduct, while promoting simplification and burden reduction; 
(4) clearly specifies the retroactive effect, if any; (5) adequately 
defines key terms; and (6) addresses other important issues affecting 
clarity and general draftsmanship under any guidelines issued by the 
Attorney General. This document is consistent with that requirement.
    Pursuant to this E.O., NHTSA notes as follows. The issue of 
preemption is discussed above, in the section discussing E.O. 13132 
(Federalism). NHTSA notes further that there is no requirement that 
individuals submit a petition for reconsideration or pursue other 
administrative proceedings before they may file suit in court.

[[Page 54628]]

Executive Order 13609 (Promoting International Regulatory Cooperation)

    E.O. 13609, ``Promoting International Regulatory Cooperation'' (77 
FR 26413, May 1, 2012), promotes international regulatory cooperation 
to meet shared challenges involving health, safety, labor, security, 
environmental, and other issues and to reduce, eliminate, or prevent 
unnecessary differences in regulatory requirements.
    The agency is currently participating in the negotiation and 
development of technical standards for Event Data Recorders in the 
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) World Forum for 
Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29). As a signatory member, 
NHTSA is obligated to initiate rulemaking to incorporate safety 
requirements and options specified in Global Technical Regulations 
(GTRs) if the U.S. votes in the affirmative to establish the GTR. No 
GTR for EDRs has been developed at this time. NHTSA has analyzed this 
proposed rule under the policies and agency responsibilities of E.O. 
13609 and has determined this rulemaking would have no effect on 
international regulatory cooperation.

National Environmental Policy Act

    The Department has analyzed the environmental impacts of this 
notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). Pursuant to 49 CFR 
1.81, the Secretary has delegated the ``functions'' under NEPA to the 
Administrators ``as they relate to the matters within the primary 
responsibility of each Operating Administration.'' NHTSA has determined 
that this proposed rule is categorically excluded pursuant to 23 CFR 
771.118(c)(4). Categorical exclusions are actions identified in an 
agency's NEPA procedures that do not normally have a significant impact 
on the environment and therefore do not require either an environmental 
assessment (EA) or environmental impact statement (EIS). This 
rulemaking, which proposes to amend the regulations regarding Event 
Data Recorders to extend the lead time and establish a four-year phase-
in, is categorically excluded pursuant to 23 CFR 771.118(c)(4) 
(Planning and administrative activities not involving or leading 
directly to construction, such as: Training, technical assistance and 
research; promulgation of rules, regulations, directives, or program 
guidance; approval of project concepts; engineering; and operating 
assistance to transit authorities to continue existing service or 
increase service to meet routine demand). NHTSA does not anticipate any 
environmental impacts, and there are no extraordinary circumstances 
present in connection with this rulemaking.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    Under the procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), a Federal agency must request and 
receive approval from OMB before it collects certain information from 
the public and a person is not required to respond to a collection of 
information by a Federal agency unless the collection displays a valid 
OMB control number. On May 28, 2025, and November 18, 2025, NHTSA 
published notices and requests for comment on a reinstatement with 
modification of a previously approved information collection to collect 
information regarding a reporting and recordkeeping requirement to 
facilitate enforcement of updates to FMVSS No. 208, ``Occupant crash 
protection.'' Those documents also requested to rename the Information 
Collection Request (ICR) associated with OMB Control No. 2127-0535 as 
``49 CFR part 585; Phase-In Reporting Requirements'' and to consolidate 
all phase-in reporting requirements including in 49 CFR part 585 in 
that ICR. This proposed rule would establish new information collection 
requirements for phase-in reporting and record retention requirements 
related to EDRs. The ICR for a reinstatement with modification of a 
previously approved information collection described below has been 
forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and 
comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and 
the expected burden.
    Agency: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
    Title: Phase-In Reporting Requirements.
    OMB Control Number: 2127-0535.
    Form Number: N/A.
    Type of Request: Reinstatement with modification of a previously 
approved information collection.
    Type of Review Requested: Regular.
    Requested Expiration Date of Approval: 3 years from date of 
approval.
    Summary of the Collection of Information: This collection would 
require manufacturers of passenger cars, multipurpose passenger 
vehicles, trucks, and buses with a gross vehicle weight rating of 3,855 
kg (8,500 pounds) or less that are equipped with EDRs to provide motor 
vehicle production data for the following four years: September 1, 
2028, to August 31, 2029; September 1, 2029, to August 31, 2030; 
September 1, 2030, to August 31, 2031; and September 1, 2031, to August 
31, 2032. Manufacturers would annually submit a report, and maintain 
records related to the report, concerning the number of such vehicles 
that meet the EDR requirements of Part 563 during the phase-in of those 
requirements.
    Description of the Need for the Information and Proposed Use of the 
Information: The purpose of the reporting requirements would be to aid 
the agency in determining whether a manufacturer of passenger cars, 
multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses with a GVWR of 3,855 
kg (8,500 pounds) or less and an unloaded vehicle weight of 2,495 kg 
(5,500 pounds) or less, has complied with the event data recorder 
requirements during the phase-in of those requirements.
    Affected Public: The respondents are manufacturers of passenger 
cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses having a gross 
vehicle weight rating of 3,855 kg (8,500 pounds) or less that are 
equipped with EDRs.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: Approximately 22 vehicle 
manufacturers.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: NHTSA estimates that the total 
annual hour burden is 22 hours.
    The annual burden involves the tasks of collection of the 
information required by the annual report as well as placing the 
information in a form suitable for record keeping and data retrieval. 
Because almost all the information required is already recorded by the 
manufacturers as part of their production control and tracking systems, 
a nominal assessment of half a burden hour per respondent is estimated 
for data retrieval and report preparation and half a burden hour per 
respondent for the record keeping of the data. Therefore, NHTSA 
estimates that the average total burden for submitting data will be 11 
hours per year (22 manufacturers x .5 hours = 11 hours) and estimates 
that the average total burden for record retention will be 11 hours per 
year (22 manufacturers x .5 hours = 11 hours). NHTSA estimates the 
labor costs associated with these labor hours using hourly labor rates 
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). BLS estimates that 
hourly wages represent approximately 70.2 percent of total compensation 
for private industry workers.\28\ For the labor costs associated

[[Page 54629]]

with this ICR, NHTSA uses the mean hourly wage of $40.64 per hour for 
``Technical Writers'' (occupational code 27-3042) for the Motor Vehicle 
Manufacturing Industry (Sectors 31, 32, and 33) \29\ and applies the 
70.2 percent factor to find the total compensation rate of $57.89 per 
hour ($40.64 per hour divided by 0.705). The total annual labor cost 
associated with the burden hours is estimated to be $1,273.58 (time 
burden of 22 hours x $57.89 cost per hour).

    Estimated Total Annual Burden Cost: $0
    NHTSA estimates that there are no costs associated with the 
proposed information collection other than labor costs associated with 
the burden hours.
    Public Comments Invited: You are asked to comment on any aspects of 
this information collection, including (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Department, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Department's estimate 
of the burden of the proposed information collection; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility and clarity of the information to be 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology.

National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act

    Under the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 
(NTTAA) (Pub. L. 104-113), ``all Federal agencies and departments shall 
use technical standards that are developed or adopted by voluntary 
consensus standards bodies, using such technical standards as a means 
to carry out policy objectives or activities determined by the agencies 
and departments.'' Voluntary consensus standards are technical 
standards (e.g., materials specifications, test methods, sampling 
procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by 
voluntary consensus standards bodies, such as SAE. The NTTAA directs 
agencies to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when the agency 
decides not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus 
standards. The NTTAA requires agencies to use voluntary consensus 
standards in lieu of government-unique standards except where 
inconsistent with law or otherwise impractical. In the December 2024 
final rule, NHTSA provided a discussion of why that final rule declined 
to use voluntary consensus standards. This discussion remains 
applicable to this proposed rule which would not change aspects of Part 
563 for which there are voluntary consensus standards. Please refer to 
Section IV.D for discussion of voluntary consensus standards in regard 
to OMB Circular A-119.

Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4) requires 
agencies to prepare a written assessment of the costs, benefits, and 
other effects of proposed or final rules that include a Federal mandate 
likely to result in the expenditures by States, local or Tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 
million or more (adjusted annually for inflation with base year of 
1995) in any one year. This proposed rule does not contain Federal 
mandates (under the regulatory provisions of Title II of the UMRA) for 
State, local and Tribal governments, or the private sector of $100 
million or more in any one year (as adjusted for inflation). Thus, the 
rulemaking is not subject to the requirements of sections 202 and 205 
of the UMRA.

Executive Order 13175 (Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments)

    E.O. 13175, ``Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments'' (65 FR 67249, November 6, 2000) requires Federal agencies 
to consult and coordinate with Tribes on a government-to-government 
basis on policies that have Tribal implications, including regulations, 
legislative comments or proposed legislation, and other policy 
statements or actions that have substantial direct effects on one or 
more Indian Tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government 
and Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities 
between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes. NHTSA has assessed 
the impact of this proposed rule on Indian tribes and determined that 
this proposed rule would not have tribal implications that require 
consultation under E.O. 13175.

Privacy Act

    In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(c), DOT solicits comments from the 
public to inform its rulemaking process. DOT posts these comments, 
without edit, to <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a>, as described in the system of 
records notice, DOT/ALL-14 FDMS, accessible through <a href="http://www.dot.gov/privacy">www.dot.gov/privacy</a>. To facilitate comment tracking and response, we encourage 
commenters to provide their name, or the name of their organization; 
however, submission of names is completely optional. Anyone is able to 
search the electronic form of all comments received into any of our 
dockets by the name of the individual submitting the comment (or 
signing the comment, if submitted on behalf of an association, 
business, or labor union.). You may review DOT's complete Privacy Act 
Statement in the Federal Register published on April 11, 2000, (Volume 
65, Number 70; Pages 19477-78).

Plain Language Requirement

    E.O. 12866 and E.O. 13563 requires each agency to write all rules 
in plain language. Application of the principles of plain language 
includes consideration of the following questions:

[[Page 54630]]

    <bullet> Have we organized the material to suit the public's needs?
    <bullet> Are the requirements in the rule clearly stated?
    <bullet> Does the rule contain technical language or jargon that is 
not clear?
    <bullet> Would a different format (grouping and order of sections, 
use of headings, paragraphing) make the rule easier to understand?
    <bullet> Would more (but shorter) sections be better?
    <bullet> Could we improve clarity by adding tables, lists, or 
diagrams?
    <bullet> What else could we do to make the rule easier to 
understand?
    If you have any responses to these questions, please include them 
in your comments on this proposal.

Regulation Identifier Number (RIN)

    The Department of Transportation assigns a regulation identifier 
number (RIN) to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of 
Federal Regulations. The Regulatory Information Service Center 
publishes the Unified Agenda twice a year. You may use the RIN 
contained in the heading at the beginning of this document to find this 
action in the Unified Agenda.

Public Participation

How do I prepare and submit comments?
    Your comments must be written and in English. To ensure that your 
comments are correctly filed in the Docket, please include the docket 
number indicated in this document in your comments.
    Your comments must not be more than 15 pages long. (49 CFR 553.21) 
NHTSA established this limit to encourage you to write your primary 
comments in a concise fashion. However, you may attach necessary 
additional documents to your comments. There is no limit on the length 
of the attachments.
    If you are submitting comments electronically as a PDF (Adobe) 
file, NHTSA asks that the documents be submitted using the Optical 
Character Recognition (OCR) process, thus allowing NHTSA to search and 
copy certain portions of your submissions.
    Please note that pursuant to the Data Quality Act, in order for 
substantive data to be relied upon and used by the agency, it must meet 
the information quality standards set forth in the OMB and DOT Data 
Quality Act guidelines. Accordingly, we encourage you to consult the 
guidelines in preparing your comments. OMB's guidelines may be accessed 
at <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/regulations/dot-information-dissemination-quality-guidelines">https://www.transportation.gov/regulations/dot-information-dissemination-quality-guidelines</a>.
How can I be sure that my comments were received?
    If you wish the Docket to notify you upon its receipt of your 
comments, enclose a self-addressed, stamped postcard in the envelope 
containing your comments. Upon receiving your comments, the Docket will 
return the postcard by mail.
How do I submit confidential business information?
    You should submit a redacted ``public version'' of your comment 
(including redacted versions of any additional documents or 
attachments) to the docket using any of the methods identified under 
ADDRESSES. This ``public version'' of your comment should contain only 
the portions for which no claim of confidential treatment is made and 
from which those portions for which confidential treatment is claimed 
has been redacted. See below for further instructions on how to do 
this.
    You also need to submit a request for confidential treatment 
directly to the Office of Chief Counsel. Requests for confidential 
treatment are governed by 49 CFR part 512. Your request must set forth 
the information specified in Part 512. This includes the materials for 
which confidentiality is being requested (as explained in more detail 
below); supporting information, pursuant to Sec.  512.8; and a 
certificate, pursuant to Sec.  512.4(b) and part 512, Appendix A.
    You are required to submit to the Office of Chief Counsel one 
unredacted ``confidential version'' of the information for which you 
are seeking confidential treatment. Pursuant to Sec.  512.6, the words 
``ENTIRE PAGE CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION'' or ``CONFIDENTIAL 
BUSINESS INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN BRACKETS'' (as applicable) must 
appear at the top of each page containing information claimed to be
