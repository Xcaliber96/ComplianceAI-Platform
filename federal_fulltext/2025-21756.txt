    On November 14, 2023, Yuba County Water Agency (YCWA) filed an 
application to relicense the 12-megawatt Narrows Hydroelectric Project 
(Narrows Project) No. 1403. The project is located on the Yuba River, 
near the City of Marysville, in Nevada County, California. On May 12, 
2025, Commission staff issued a notice of intent to prepare an 
environmental assessment (EA) to evaluate the effects of relicensing 
the Narrows Project. The notice included an anticipated schedule for 
issuing the EA in November 2025.
    Staff are still evaluating the effects of relicensing the Narrows 
Project. In order for staff to fully consider all the information filed 
by YCWA, the procedural schedule for completing the EA is being revised 
as follows. Further revisions to the schedule may be made as 
appropriate.
