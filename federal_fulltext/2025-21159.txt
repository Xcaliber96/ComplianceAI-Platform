SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title; Associated Form; and OMB Number: Spouse Education and Career 
Opportunities (SECO) Program; OMB Control Number 0704-0556.
    Type of Request: Revision.
    Number of Respondents: 24,247.

    Annual Responses: 24,247.
    Average Burden per Response: 30 minutes.

    Needs and Uses: The DoD SECO Program is the primary source of 
education, career and employment counseling for all military spouses 
who are seeking post-secondary education, training, licenses and 
credentials needed for portable career employment. The SECO system 
delivers the resources and tools necessary to assist spouses of service 
members with career exploration/discovery, career education and 
training, employment readiness, and career connections at any point 
within the spouse career lifecycle. It is imperative that the DoD 
collect data to ensure that the SECO program is meeting its overarching 
goal of increasing employment opportunities for military spouses. The 
DoD requires the information in the proposed collection for program 
planning and management purposes. Collected information will ensure 
that the SECO program will be able to collect relevant metrics and make 
determinations of program viability and improvement. Additionally, the 
data collected is utilized to build a spouse profile that allows 
information to be saved over time and to prepopulate information into 
tools such as resume builders and career and education planning 
resources.
    Affected Public: Individuals or households.
    Frequency: On Occasion.
    Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary.
    DOD Clearance Officer: Mr. Reginald Lucas.

    Dated: November 21, 2025.
