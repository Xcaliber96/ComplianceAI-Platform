    Justification: HRSA is providing a $1.175 million supplement to 
each of the 12 MSE grant recipients from cohort 2023; HRSA-23-124. The 
supplement will provide scholarships to medical students in their 3rd 
or 4th year, who are applying to primary care residency programs in 
general internal medicine, general pediatrics, family medicine, or 
internal medicine/pediatrics. This core funding is designed to support 
students early in their training who are aligned with the MSE Program 
purpose, goals, and objectives. These years are critical in a student's 
educational journey, as they begin clinical rotations, choose and apply 
for residency training specialties, and make firm decisions about 
future practice locations. This supplement provides additional 
incentive and support at a time when long-term career intentions are 
being considered. In addition, the following activities are required 
under this supplement:
    (1) Support the development of faculty in general internal 
medicine, general pediatrics, family medicine, or internal medicine/
pediatrics.
    (2) Support the training of general internal medicine, general 
pediatrics,

family medicine, or internal medicine/pediatrics primary care providers 
to become and/or serve as preceptors and provide stipend support as 
needed.
    (3) Create/enhance and implement curricula that includes:
    <bullet> Integrating behavioral health and primary care practice 
including prevention and treatment of opioid and other substance use 
disorders;
    <bullet> Incorporating the use of telehealth and technology methods 
such as Multiple Chronic Conditions e-Care Plan, artificial 
intelligence and assistive technology, and mobile health technologies 
to provide telehealth and in-person care delivery;
    <bullet> Facilitating health systems and practice transformation 
through the use of digital health, value-based care, and patient-
centered approaches to improve quality, reduce costs, and adapt to new 
technologies and payment models; and
    <bullet> Educating and training medical students on environmental 
health and community nutrition needs to Make America Healthy Again.
