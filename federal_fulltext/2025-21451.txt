SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title of Collection: Consumer Response Intake Form.
    OMB Control Number: 3170-0011.
    Type of Review: Extension of a currently approved information 
collection.
    Affected Public: Individuals or households.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 6,000,000.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 1,123,334.
    Abstract: The Consumer Response Intake Form is designed to aid 
consumers in the submission of complaints, inquiries, and feedback and 
to help the Bureau fulfill its statutory requirements. Consumers (also 
referred to as respondents) will be able to complete and submit 
information through the Intake Form electronically on the Bureau's 
website. Alternatively, respondents may request that the Bureau mail a 
paper copy of the Intake Form and then mail it back to the Bureau or 
call to submit a complaint by telephone. The questions within the 
Intake Form prompt respondents for a description of, and key facts 
about, the complaint at issue, the desired resolution, contact and 
account information, information about the company they are submitting 
a complaint about, and previous action taken to attempt to resolve the 
complaint.
    Request for Comments: Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the CFPB, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (b) The accuracy of the CFPB's estimate of the 
burden of the collection of information, including the validity of the 
methods and the assumptions used; (c) Ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) Ways 
to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, 
including through the use of automated collection techniques or other 
forms of information technology. Comments submitted in response to this 
notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB's 
approval. All comments will become a matter of public record.

Anthony May,
Paperwork Reduction Act Officer, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
