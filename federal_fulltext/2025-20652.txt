[Docket No: SSA-2025-0651]


Agency Information Collection Activities: Comment Request

    The Social Security Administration (SSA) publishes a list of 
information collection packages requiring clearance by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) in compliance with Public Law 104-13, the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, effective October 1, 1995. This notice 
includes a revision of OMB-approved information collection.
    SSA is soliciting comments on the accuracy of the agency's burden 
estimate; the need for the information; its practical utility; ways to 
enhance its quality, utility, and clarity; and ways to minimize burden 
on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology. Mail, email, or fax your 
comments and recommendations on the information collection to the OMB 
Desk Officer and SSA Reports Clearance Officer at the following 
addresses or fax numbers.

    SSA submitted the information collection below to OMB for 
clearance. Your comments regarding this information collection would be 
most useful if OMB and SSA receive them 30 days from the date of this 
publication. To be sure we consider your comments, we must receive them 
no later than December 24, 2025. Individuals can obtain copies of the 
OMB clearance package by writing to the <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6d223f433f081d021f191e432e01080c1f0c030e082d1e1e0c430a021b"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="80cfd2aed2e5f0eff2f4f3aec3ece5e1f2e1eee3e5c0f3f3e1aee7eff6">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
    Fee Agreement for Representation before the Social Security 
Administration--0960-0810. The Social Security Act requires individuals 
who represent a claimant before the agency and want to receive a fee 
for their services to obtain SSA's authorization of the fee. One way to 
obtain the authorization is to submit the fee agreement to the agency 
either in writing or through using Form SSA-1693, Fee Agreement for 
Representation before the Social Security Administration. Since 
representatives currently use fee agreements which vary in length, 
content, and complexity, submission of a free-form fee agreement may 
cause delays in SSA's review time. SSA encourages respondents to use 
Form SSA-1693 to submit the information either using the paper form or 
the electronically submittable e1693 through SSA's website. SSA uses 
the information from the SSA-1693 to review the request and authorize 
any fee to representatives who seek to charge and collect a fee from a 
claimant. The respondents are the representatives who help claimants 
through the application process, and the claimants who they represent.

    Note: We are revising the burden for this information 
collection, and updating the Privacy Act Statement to comply with 
current legal requirements.

    Type of Request: Revision of an OMB-approved information 
collection.

* We based this figure on the averaged total of the average Lawyer's Legal Services wages, as reported by Bureau of Labor Statistics data, and the
  average U.S. worker's hourly wages, as reported by Bureau of Labor Statistics data (Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics).
** We based this figure on the average FY 2026 wait times for field offices (16 minutes), based on SSA's current management information data. This
  figure reflects the data posted on our public facing website (800 number performance <radical> SSA) on the date we drafted this notice. As the figures
  fluctuate daily, the wait times may be different on the publication date of this notice. While we are including this theoretical cost, respondents
  typically choose to mail or fax the paper form rather than deliver the form in person to a field office.
** This figure does not represent actual costs that SSA is imposing on recipients of Social Security payments to complete this application; rather,
  these are theoretical opportunity costs for the additional time respondents will spend to complete the application. There is no actual charge to
  respondents to complete the application
