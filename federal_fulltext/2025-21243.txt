Clearance of Renewed Approval of Information Collection: Suspected 
Unapproved Parts Report

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Notice and request for comments.

invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information 
collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period

8120-11 is reported voluntarily by manufacturers, repair stations, 
aircraft owner/operators, air carriers, and the general public who wish 
to report the discovery of, and potential use or possession of aircraft 
suspected unapproved parts to the FAA for review. The report 
information is collected and evaluated by the FAA, Aviation Safety 
Hotline Program Office, and used to determine if an unapproved part 
investigation is warranted.

DATES: Written comments should be submitted by December 26, 2025.

ADDRESSES: Written comments and recommendations for the proposed 
information collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of 
this notice to <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a>. Find this particular

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Public Comments Invited: You are asked to comment on any aspect of 
this information collection, including (a) Whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for FAA's performance; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimated burden; (c) ways for FAA to enhance the 
quality, utility and clarity of the information collection; and (d) 
ways that the burden could be minimized without reducing the quality of 
the collected information.
    OMB Control Number: 2120-0552.
    Title: Suspected Unapproved Parts Report.
    Form Numbers: FAA Form 8120-11.
    Type of Review: Renewal of an information collection.
    Background: The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment 
period soliciting comments on the following collection of information 
was published on May 22, 2025 (90 FR 21983). The information collected 
on the FAA Form 8120-11 is reported voluntarily by manufacturers, 
repair stations, aircraft owner/operators, air carriers, and the 
general public who wish to report suspected unapproved parts to the FAA 
for review. The report information is collected and correlated by the 
FAA, Aviation Safety Hotline Program Office, and used to determine if 
an unapproved part investigation is warranted. When unapproved parts 
are confirmed that are likely to exist on other products or aircraft of 
the same or similar design or are being used in other facilities, the 
information is used as a basis for an aviation industry alert or 
notification. Alerts are used to inform industry of situations 
essential to the prevention of accidents. If the information had not 
been collected, the consequence to the aviation community would be the 
inability to determine whether or not unapproved parts are being 
offered for sale or use for installation on type-certificated products.
    Procedures and processes relating to the SUP program and associated 
reports are found in FAA Order 8120.16A,

[[Page 54453]]

Suspected Unapproved Parts Program, and AC 21-29, Detecting and 
Reporting Suspected Unapproved Parts. When unapproved parts are 
identified, the FAA notifies the public by published Field 
Notifications (FN), disseminated using Unapproved Parts Notifications 
(UPN), a Safety Alert for Operators (SAFO), Aviation Maintenance 
Alerts, Airworthiness Directives (AD), entry into an issue of the 
Service Difficulty Reporting Summary, a Special Airworthiness 
Information Bulletin, a display on an internet site, or direct mailing. 
Reporting of information is strictly voluntary. The information is 
requested from any individual or facility suspecting an unapproved 
part. Any burden is minimized by requesting only necessary information 
to warrant an investigation.
    Respondents: Anyone may fill out and send a Form 8120-11 into the 
FAA.
    Frequency: Whenever anyone discovers or suspects they have received 
an unapproved part.
    Estimated Average Burden per Response: About 12 minutes to read and 
disposition each form.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden: The FAA collects approximately 30 
forms from the public per year.

    Issued in Fort Worth, Texas.
