CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION

[Docket No. CPSC-2012-0058]


Agency Information Collection Activities; Extension of 
Collection; Safety Standard for Walk-Behind Power Lawn Mowers

AGENCY: Consumer Product Safety Commission.

ACTION: Notice of information collection; request for comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) announces that 
the Commission has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) a request for extension of approval of information collection 
requirements associated with the Safety Standard for Walk-Behind Power 
Lawn Mowers. OMB previously approved the collection of information 
under control number 3041-0091. OMB's most recent extension of approval 
will expire on November 30, 2025. On September 23, 2025, CPSC published 
a notice in the Federal Register to announce the agency's intention to 
seek extension of approval of the collection of information. The 
Commission received four public comments. Therefore, by publication of 
this notice, the Commission announces that CPSC has submitted to OMB a 
request for extension of approval of that collection of information.

DATES: Submit comments on the collection of information by December 29, 
2025.

ADDRESSES: Submit comments about this request by email: 
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f1beb8a3b0ae8284939c988282989e9fb19e9c93df949e81df969e87"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="90dfd9c2d1cfe3e5f2fdf9e3e3f9fffed0fffdf2bef5ffe0bef7ffe6">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or fax: 202-395-6881. Comments by mail 
should be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
Attn: OMB Desk Officer for the CPSC, Office of Management and Budget,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: CPSC seeks to renew the following currently 
approved collection of information:
    Title: Safety Standard for Walk-Behind Lawn Mowers.
    OMB Number: 3041-0091.

[[Page 55090]]

    Type of Review: Renewal of collection.
    Frequency of Response: On occasion.
    Affected Public: Manufacturers and importers of walk-behind power 
lawn mowers.
    General Description of Collection: The Safety Standard for Walk-
Behind Power Lawn Mowers (16 CFR part 1205) addresses blade contact 
injuries. Subpart B of the standard sets forth regulations prescribing 
requirements for a reasonable testing program to support certificates 
of compliance with the standard for walk-behind power lawn mowers. 
Section 14(a) of the CPSA requires manufacturers, importers, and 
private labelers of a consumer product subject to a consumer product 
safety standard to issue a certificate stating that the product 
complies with all applicable consumer product safety standards. 15 
U.S.C. 2063(a). Section 14(a) of the CPSA also requires that the 
certificate of compliance must be based on a test of each product or 
upon a reasonable testing program. Id. The rule requires manufacturers 
(including importers) to establish and maintain written records showing 
that the certificates of compliance issued are based on a test of each 
mower or on a reasonable testing program. The records are to be 
maintained for a period of at least three years from the date of 
certification of each mower or each production lot. The rule also 
requires that the certificates be in the form of a label on the product 
stating (1) ``Meets CPSC blade safety requirements''; (2) an 
identification of the production lot; (3) the name of the person or 
firm issuing the certificate; (4) the location where the product was 
principally assembled; and (5) the month and year the product was 
manufactured. See 16 CFR 1205.35(a)-(b).
    Estimated Number of Respondents: CPSC estimates approximately 34 
lawn-mower suppliers will respond to the collection annually.
    Estimated Time per Response: Based on subject matter knowledge and 
previous experience during compliance inspections conducted for lawn 
mowers subject to the standard, CPSC estimates that each respondent 
expends eight hours daily engaged in compiling and maintaining a 
testing record to support the certification of a production lot of lawn 
mowers. This may involve testing approximately five to six lawn mowers 
per day and recording test results in some form of a retrievable record 
system. CPSC assumes testing is performed over 130 estimated yearly 
production days, based on a highly seasonal production period. Thus, 
total hour burden to respondents for the recordkeeping associated with 
testing to support certification is estimated to be 1,040 hours per 
respondent (8 x 130). For the specified labeling requirements, the 
information should be readily available, and it could take a 
manufacturer an additional hour per production day to collect the 
information and place it on the label. Therefore, an additional 130 
hours per respondent have been added to the total burden, which is 
1,170 hours (1,040 + 130).
    Total Estimated Annual Burden: CPSC estimates that the annual 
burden for compiling and maintaining a testing record to support 
certification is estimated to be 35,360 hours (34 respondents x 1,040 
hours). The estimated additional burden related to labeling is 4,420 
hours. The total annual burden hours related to recordkeeping 
associated with certification, and labeling are estimated to be 39,780 
hours for the collection of information annually (35,360 + 4,420).
    Total Estimated Annual Cost to Respondents: CPSC estimates that the 
cost of collecting information related to testing is approximately 
$2,729,438.40 based on 35,360 hours x $77.19 (total compensation for 
management, professional, and related workers in goods-producing 
industries) and annual cost burden related to labeling is estimated to 
be $183,827.80 based on 4,420 hours x $41.59 (total compensation for 
all sales and office workers in goods-producing industries).\1\ 
Therefore, total annual burden costs related to the information 
collection are estimated to be $2,913,266.20 ($2,729,438.40 + 
$183,827.80).

    Response to Public Comments: Three comments were out of scope. The 
fourth commenter, Outdoor Power Equipment Institute (OPEI), asserted 
that CPSC's burden estimates are low because CPSC does not account for 
manufacturers that may be producing mowers all year-round. CPSC's 
estimated burden assumes 130 yearly production days, based on a highly 
seasonal production period. OPEI agrees that this is true for some 
manufacturers. However, OPEI asserts that there are other 
manufacturers, without specifying how many, who are in production for 
an estimated 250 business days all year-round. Some firms may have more 
than 130 yearly production days, even up to 250 business production 
days, as suggested by OPEI, and others may have fewer production days. 
OPEI has not provided any detailed information that will assist in 
revising the estimated PRA burden. For this reason, CPSC is not 
revising its current burden estimates based on 130 days of production 
per year.
    OPEI also expressed concerns about potential duplicative burdens 
associated with e-filing requirements under a new rule, Certificates of 
Compliance. See 16 CFR 1110. The PRA burden associated with the e-
filing requirements for walk-behind lawn mowers is accounted for in the 
final e-filing rule. 90 FR 1800, 1839 (Jan. 8, 2025).\2\

    \2\ OMB approved the information collection request associated 
with the e-filing rule on February, 28, 2025. See OMB Control No. 
3041-0203.
