SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    On February 14, 2024, the DoD published a final rule, 
``Identification (ID) Cards for Members of the

[[Page 55043]]

Uniformed Services, Their Dependents, and Other Eligible Individuals'' 
(89 FR 11172-11198), concerning the policies and procedures for issuing 
DoD ID cards. That final rule included the procedures for retirees, 
dependents, and contractor employees to request a change to their 
``gender marker'' in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting 
System (DEERS). Executive Order 14168, ``Defending Women from Gender 
Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal 
Government,'' issued January 30, 2025, recognized two sexes, male and 
female, and stated that ``these sexes are not changeable and are 
grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.'' The Executive 
Order also requires Federal agencies to ensure that all applicable 
policies and documents, including rules, use the term ``sex'' and not 
``gender.''

Legal Authority

    Authorities for this rule include 5 United States Code (U.S.C.) 
5703 (per diem, travel, and transportation expenses; experts and 
consultants; individuals serving without pay); and 10 U.S.C. 1044a 
(authority to act as a notary); 1061-1064 (commissary and exchange 
benefits); 1072-1074, 1074a-1074c, 1076, 1076a, 1077, 1095(k)(2) 
(medical and dental care); 1408(h) (payment of retired or retainer pay 
in compliance with court orders/benefits for dependents who are victims 
of abuse by members losing right to retired pay); and Chapter 1223 
(retired pay). These authorities provide members of the Uniformed 
Services (active component, reserve component, or retired members) and 
their spouses and dependents certain benefits and privileges. 18 U.S.C. 
499 (military, naval, or official passes), 506 (seals of departments or 
agencies), 509 (possessing and making plates or stones for Government 
transportation requests), 701 (official badges, identification cards, 
other insignia), and 1001 (statements or entries generally), address 
penalties, fines and imprisonment for unauthorized reproduction of ID 
cards.

Changes Made With This Rule

    On February 14, 2024, the DoD published a final rule in the Federal 
Register (89 FR 11172-11198) on the policies and procedures for issuing 
DoD ID cards. Included in the final rule was a provision that allowed 
retirees, dependents, and contractor employees to request their 
``gender marker'' be changed based on their preference. E.O. 14168,\1\ 
requires Federal agencies to ensure that all applicable policies and 
documents, including rules, use the term ``sex'' and not ``gender.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Available at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-30/pdf/2025-02090.pdf">https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-30/pdf/2025-02090.pdf</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With this rule the Department removes and replaces three instances 
of ``gender'' with ``sex'' and one instance of ``gender marker'' with 
``sex code.'' Additionally, the interim final rule removes the 
procedure for retirees, dependents, and contractor employees to elect 
to change this data in DEERS, absent an administrative error. DoD has 
determined that receiving public comment prior to effectuating this CFR 
amendment is impracticable and against public interest. DoD seeks to 
avoid confusion and prevent unnecessary time spent on self-attestation 
requests, which would not be processed upon the final rule taking 
effect. For these same reasons, DoD finds good cause to make the 
interim final rule enforceable immediately upon publication.

Regulatory Compliance

    Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Department finds there is good 
cause to make this final rule effective immediately upon publication. 
This final rule codifies actions taken under direct Presidential 
authority. Removing the regulations immediately provides transparency 
and may reduce confusion. Further, a delayed effective date serves no 
practical purpose here since no adjustment period is needed for any 
regulated party to come into or otherwise prepare for compliance

Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' and 
Executive Order 13563, ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review''

    EOs 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and 
benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety 
effects, distributive impacts, and equity). E.O. 13563 emphasizes the 
importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, 
of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This rule is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under E.O. 12866 and was not reviewed 
by OMB. This rule is not an E.O. 14192 regulatory action because this 
rule is not significant under E.O. 12866.

Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801, et seq.)

    The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801, et seq., as amended by 
the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 
generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency 
promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy 
of the rule, to each house of the Congress and to the Comptroller 
General of the United States. DoD will submit a report containing this 
rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House 
of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States. 
This interim final rule is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 
804(2).

Title 2 U.S.C. Chapter 25, ``Unfunded Mandates Reform Act''

    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (2 
U.S.C. 1532) requires agencies to assess anticipated costs and benefits 
before issuing any rule whose mandates require spending in any one year 
of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. This 
rule will not mandate any requirements for State, local, or tribal 
governments, nor will it affect private sector costs.

Public Law 96-354, ``Regulatory Flexibility Act'' (5 U.S.C. Chapter 6)

    The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness 
certifies this interim final rule is not subject to the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act because it would not, if promulgated, have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
Therefore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as amended, does not require 
us to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Public Law 96-511, ``Paperwork Reduction Act'' (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35)

    Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, OMB approved and 
assigned OMB Control Number 0704-0415, ``Application for Department of 
Defense Common Access Card--DEERS Enrollment.'' The provision for the 
self-attestation for changing a sex code (gender marker) in an 
individual's DEERS record (89 FR 11172) required only a signed 
individual statement. The ``Application for Department of Defense 
Common Access Card--DEERS Enrollment'' was not required and it was 
determined that the self-attestation did not change the cost or burden 
associated with this information collection. Therefore, removing the 
provision also has no effect on the cost or burden of the information 
collection. Additional information regarding this

search function to enter either the tile of the collection or the OMB 
Control Number.

Executive Order 13132, ``Federalism''

    E.O. 13132 establishes certain requirements that an agency must 
meet when it promulgates an interim final rule that imposes substantial 
direct requirement costs on State and local governments, preempts State 
law, or otherwise has federalism implications. This rule will not have 
a substantial effect on State and local governments.

Executive Order 13175, ``Consultation and Coordination With Indian 
Tribal Governments''

    E.O. 13175 establishes certain requirements that an agency must 
meet when it promulgates an interim final rule that imposes substantial 
direct compliance costs on one or more Indian tribes, preempts tribal 
law, or effects the distribution of power and responsibilities between 
the Federal government and Indian tribes. This interim final rule will 
not have a substantial effect on Indian tribal governments.
