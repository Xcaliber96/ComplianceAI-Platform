II. Background

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
Chapter 35), the NRC is requesting public comment on its intention to 
request the OMB's approval for the information collection summarized as 
follows.
    1. The title of the information collection: Collection of Research 
Code Non-Disclosure Agreement Information.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0240.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: The 
collection is required every time an NRC developed code is requested by 
users.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Users of the code from 
domestic and foreign licensees, universities, corporations, and members 
of the public, as well as foreign technical support organizations.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 962.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 962.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 962.
    10. Abstract: This information collection request is a non-
disclosure agreement (NDA) used for domestic and foreign entities to 
obtain and use the NRC's nuclear safety analytical computer codes. NRC 
develops and uses computer codes to independently model and evaluate 
safety issues associated with the licensed use of radioactive 
materials. As a global leader in nuclear regulatory research and safety 
assessment, NRC is frequently approached by domestic and international 
organizations requesting copies of NRC computer codes. In general, to 
obtain an NRC code an individual or organization first agrees to not 
redistribute the code (i.e., non-disclosure) through an NDA. The NDA 
also imposes terms and conditions for code use, and requires 
notification to NRC of code errors, code modifications, and updated 
user information. An officially signed and executed NDA of users 
agreeing to the terms and conditions is current NRC practice for access 
to NRC-developed computer codes. Once the NDA has been signed, 
received, reviewed, and accepted, the requesting individual or 
organization is given access to the requested code. The information 
collection enables the NRC to ensure that proper procedures and 
agreements are in place to guide the distribution and use of these 
codes according to NRC and U.S. Government policies and international 
agreements such as import-export restrictions and intellectual property 
rights. Further information collection on code errors and modifications 
by code users permits NRC to maintain control and quality of its codes 
in a timely and efficient manner.

III. Specific Requests for Comments

    The NRC is seeking comments that address the following questions:
    1. Is the proposed collection of information necessary for the NRC 
to properly perform its functions? Does the information have practical 
utility? Please explain your answer.
    2. Is the estimate of the burden of the information collection 
accurate? Please explain your answer.
    3. Is there a way to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected?
    4. How can the burden of the information collection on respondents 
be minimized, including the use of automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology?
