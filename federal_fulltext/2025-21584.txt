    This notice is being published less than 15 days from the 
meeting date due to exceptional circumstances. As a result of the 
43-day government shutdown, due to lapsed appropriations, the above 
meeting was canceled. This meeting was to assess the scientific and 
technical merit of NIH grant applications, required by statute to 
disburse NIH funds. The meeting must take place urgently so that 
evaluations of biomedical research applications addressing multiple 
major public health priorities can be submitted to the national 
advisory councils for timely funding recommendations.
