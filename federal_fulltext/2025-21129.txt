SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    Section 1102 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security 
(CARES) Act, Public Law 116-136, authorized SBA to guarantee loans made 
by banks or other financial institutions under a temporary program 
titled the ``Paycheck Protection Program'' (PPP). These loans were 
available to eligible small businesses, certain non-profit 
organizations, veterans' organizations, Tribal business concerns, 
independent contractors, and self-employed individuals adversely 
impacted by the COVID-19 Emergency. SBA's authority to guarantee PPP 
loans expired on August 8, 2020. On December 27, 2020, SBA received 
reauthorization under the Economic Aid Act, Public Law 116-260, to 
resume guaranteeing PPP loans through March 31, 2021. The Economic Aid 
Act also allowed certain eligible borrowers that previously received a 
PPP loan to receive a second draw PPP loan (``Second Draw PPP Loan 
Program'') and amended certain other PPP statutory provisions. On March 
11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act, Public Law 117-2, was enacted, 
amending various PPP statutory provisions. On March 30, 2021, the PPP 
Extension Act of 2021 was enacted, extending the SBA's PPP program 
authority through June 30, 2021.
    This information collection is used for the Second Draw PPP Loan 
Program. This approval is set to expire on January 31, 2026. Although 
SBA's program authority has expired, this information collection is 
still needed. Under the Interim Final Rule on Paycheck Protection 
Program--Extension of Lender Records Retention Requirements (89 FR 
68090, August 23, 2024), PPP loan records retention requirements for 
PPP lenders are ten years from the date of disposition of each 
individual PPP loan. Because the PPP lender recordkeeping requirements 
extend through at least June 30, 2031 (ten years after SBA's authority 
to issue PPP loan numbers expired), this information collection needs 
to be extended accordingly. Therefore, as required by the Paperwork 
Reduction Act, SBA is publishing this notice as a prerequisite to 
seeking OMB's approval to use this information collection beyond 
January 31, 2026. There are no proposed changes to any of the forms.

Solicitation of Public Comments

    SBA invites the public to submit comments, including specific and 
detailed suggestions on ways to improve the collection and reduce the 
burden on respondents. Commenters should also address (i) whether the 
information collection is necessary for the proper performance of SBA's 
functions, including whether it has any practical utility; (ii) the 
accuracy of the estimated burdens; (iii) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (iv) the 
use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology to minimize the information collection burden on those who 
are required to respond.
