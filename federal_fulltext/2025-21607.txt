Overview of This Information Collection

    Title: Entry Summary.
    OMB Number: 1651-0022.
    Form Number: 7501.
    Current Actions: Revision.
    Type of Review: Revision.
    Affected Public: Importer, importer's agent for each import 
transaction.
    Abstract: CBP Form 7501, Entry Summary, is used to identify 
merchandise entering the commerce of the United States, and to document 
the amount of duty and/or tax paid. CBP Form 7501 is submitted by the 
importer, or the importer's agent, for each import transaction. The 
data on this form is used by CBP as a record of the import transaction; 
to collect the proper duty, taxes, certifications, and enforcement 
information; and to provide data to the U.S. Census Bureau for 
statistical purposes. CBP Form 7501 must be filed within 10 working 
days from the time of entry of merchandise into the United States. 
Collection of the data on this form is authorized by 19 U.S.C. 1484 and 
provided for by 19 CFR 141.61 and 19 CFR 142.11. CBP Form 7501 and 
accompanying instructions can be found at: <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/forms?title_1=7501">https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/forms?title_1=7501</a>.
    Previously approved revision to Form 7501:
    For certain Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) classifications of 
steel imports, the country where the steel used in the manufacture of 
the product was melted and poured; the country where the steel used in 
the manufacture of the product was melted and poured applies to the 
original location where the raw steel is first produced in a steel-
making furnace in a liquid state; and then poured into its first solid 
shape.
    For certain HTS classifications of aluminum imports, the countries 
where the largest and second largest volume of primary aluminum used in 
the manufacture of the imported aluminum product was smelted; and the 
country where the aluminum used in the imported aluminum product was 
most recently cast. The fields requiring identification of the 
countries where the largest volume of primary aluminum used in the 
manufacture of the product was smelted applies to the country where the 
largest volume of new aluminum metal is produced from alumina (or 
aluminum oxide) by the electrolytic Hall-H[eacute]roult process. 
Importers may be required to report if primary aluminum from specific 
countries is used in the imported aluminum product, if required by law 
and/or Presidential Proclamation.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The February 24, 2023 Presidential Proclamation on Adjusting 
Imports of Aluminum Into the United States requires importers to 
provide to CBP information necessary to identify the countries where 
the primary aluminum used in the manufacture of certain imports of 
aluminum articles are smelted and information necessary to identify 
the countries where such aluminum articles imports are cast. This 
notice proposes to add the aluminum smelt and cast data fields to 
Form 7501 independently from the February 24, 2023 Proclamation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Importers will be required to report on Form 7501 the steel country 
of melt and pour and aluminum countries of smelt and cast for imports 
under those steel and aluminum HTS classifications subject to the 
Commerce Department's steel and aluminum import license applications, 
and where applicable, the Section 232 steel and aluminum measures.
    The data elements align the Form 7501 reporting requirements with 
the Commerce Department's existing reporting requirements for steel 
melt and pour and aluminum smelt and cast countries for steel and 
aluminum import license applications under 19 CFR 360.103(c)(1) and 19 
CFR 361.103(c)(1). The aluminum and steel license application 
information is used by the Commerce Department for monitoring of 
anticipated imports of certain aluminum and steel products into the 
United States. The Form 7501 data is used by CBP to determine, when 
imports are entered for consumption, the proper number of duties, 
applicable fees, taxes, and imports subject to quota.
    These data fields are also required to enforce the tariff rate 
quotas for imported steel and aluminum established by the following 
Presidential Proclamations under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act 
of 1962, as amended: for products of the European Union, Proclamation 
10327 of December 27, 2021 (87 FR 1, January 3, 2022) and Proclamation 
10328 of December 27, 2021 (87 FR 11, January 3, 2022); for products of 
Japan (steel-only), Proclamation 10356 of March 31, 2022 (87 FR 19351, 
April 1, 2022); and for products of the United Kingdom, Proclamation 
10405 of May 31, 2022 (87 FR 33583, June 3, 2022) and Proclamation 
10406 of May 31, 2022 (87 FR 33591, June 3, 2022); and any amendments 
to these Proclamations.
