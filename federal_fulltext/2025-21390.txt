SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[OMB Control No. 3235-0282]


Agency Information Collection Activities; Submission for OMB 
Review; Comment Request; Reinstatement Without Change: Rule 23c-2

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') a request for extension of the 
previously approved collection of information discussed below.
    The title for the collection of information is ``Rule 23c-2 (17 CFR 
270.23c-2) under the Investment Company Act of 1940.'' Rule 23c-2(a) 
(17 CFR 270.23c-2(a)) under the Act provides that a closed-end fund may 
call or redeem any securities it has issued in accordance with the 
charter, provided that in instances where less than all of the 
outstanding shares of a class or series are called or redeemed, the 
call or redemption is made by lot on a pro rata basis, or in a manner 
that does not discriminate against any shareholders. Further, rule 23c-
2(b) (17 CFR 270.23c-2(b)) requires closed-end funds that propose to 
call or redeem any securities it has issued to file with the Commission 
notice of its intention at least 30 days prior to the date set for the 
call or redemption, provided that if such notice is required to by 
published in newspaper, notice is required within 10 days of 
publication. The notice is required to include (1) the title of the 
class of securities to be called or redeemed; (2) the date on which the 
securities are to be called or redeemed; (3) the applicable provisions 
of the governing instrument pursuant to which the securities are to be 
called or redeemed; and (4) if less than all the outstanding securities 
of a class or series are to be called or redeemed, the principal amount 
or number of shares and the basis upon which the securities to be call 
or redeemed are to be selected.
    The Commission last submitted an information collection request 
(``ICR'') regarding this rule to OMB for approval under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (``PRA'') in November of 1982. The submission was 
subsequently approved in February of 1983. The Commission never sought 
an extension of the previously approved ICR upon expiration of the OMB 
approval in February of 1986. The reason the Commission never sought an 
extension is because the number of responses to this ICR recorded 
within the 1982 submission was only five, which is below the threshold 
of ten respondents outlined within the PRA for requiring OMB clearance. 
The Commission is now seeking to reinstate the rule 23c-2 ICR under 
control number 3235-0282.
    Commission staff estimates that approximately 75 closed-end funds 
undertake an average of 110 proposed calls or redemptions of securities 
annually under rule 23c-2. Staff estimates further that, with respect 
to each proposed call or redemption, each fund spends 1.5 hours to 
comply with the rule's filing requirement with the Commission. Thus, 
Commission staff estimates the total annual respondent reporting burden 
is 165 hours. The total annual cost for all funds is estimated to be 
$81,180.
    The requirements of this collection of information are mandatory. 
Responses will not be kept confidential. An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid OMB Control Number.
    The public may view and comment on this information collection 
request at: <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202507-3235-015">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202507-3235-015</a> or email comment to

    Dated: November 24, 2025.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
