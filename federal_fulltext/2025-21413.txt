I. Background

    The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection 
(CT DEEP) established its SIP, including its NSR permit program, in 
1972 in accordance with CAA section 110 and 40 CFR part 51. Since then, 
there have been numerous revisions to the SIP in accordance with state 
and federal air permitting regulations. The most recent federally 
enforceable revision to Connecticut's NSR permit program was approved 
into the SIP by EPA on September 5, 2023, and included changes to 
sections 22a-174-2a and 22a-174-3a of the Regulations of Connecticut 
State Agencies (RCSA).

II. Description and Review of Submittal

    On October 3, 2024,\1\ CT DEEP submitted a SIP revision containing 
changes to RCSA section 22a-174-3a, primarily to clarify the 
applicability of Connecticut's permit requirements for stationary 
sources in nonattainment areas. These revisions to RCSA became 
effective, as a matter of state enforceability, on March 14, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The Connecticut SIP cover letter lists a submittal date of 
June 27, 2024, however EPA received this through the online 
submittal system State Planning Electronic Collaboration System 
(SPeCS) on October 3, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The first revision made by CT DEEP is to RCSA section 22a-174-
3a(a)(2)(C)(ii), which references the federal definition of a ``non-
road engine.'' The citation to 40 CFR part 89 in this clause was 
amended to 40 CFR 1068.30 in order reflect the correct citation after 
EPA renumbering. The two other revisions relate to subsection (l) of 
RCSA section 22a-174-3a, which addresses permit requirements for 
nonattainment areas. Subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of subsection 
(l) is amended to clarify how the subsection applies to modifications. 
The revised text provides more detail on how changes to an existing 
unit may be considered a major modification. The amended text also 
includes references to Table 3a(k)-1, which lists the significant 
emission rate threshold values for pollutants and their precursors. In 
subparagraph (C) of the same subdivision, the text is revised to add 
the phrase ``for such pollutant'' after ``nonattainment area'' for 
clarity.

III. EPA's Evaluation of CT DEEP's Submittal

    EPA has reviewed the following revisions to RCSA section 22a-174-3a 
submitted by CT DEEP.

1. RCSA Section 22a-174-3a(a)(2)(C)(ii)

    CT DEEP revised this provision to replace the outdated reference to 
40 CFR part 89 with the current federal definition of ``nonroad 
engine'' at 40 CFR 1068.30. EPA has determined that this correction 
does not change the applicability of the exemption for nonroad engines 
but ensures that the state regulation references the appropriate 
federal definition.

2. RCSA Section 22a-174-3a(l)(1)(B)

    CT DEEP revised this provision to clarify the applicability of 
nonattainment new source review (NNSR) requirements to modifications at 
major stationary sources. The revised regulations clarify that the NNSR 
program applies to two categories of modifications:
    (i) modifications to an emission unit that is itself a major 
stationary source that triggers NNSR when the modification results in a 
significant emissions increase equal to or greater than the significant 
emission rate thresholds of a pollutant (or their precursors) for which 
the area is designated as nonattainment; or
    (ii) modifications to a premises that is a major stationary source 
that triggers NNSR when the modification results in a net emissions 
increase equal to or greater than the significant emission rate 
threshold of a pollutant (or their precursors) for which the area is 
designated as nonattainment.
    The revisions to 22a-174-3a(l)(1)(B) do not change NNSR 
applicability thresholds, offset obligations, or control technology 
requirements, but rather clarify the circumstances that a modification 
may be considered major and trigger NNSR to either a unit itself or to 
a premises that is considered a major stationary source. EPA has 
determined that this revision appropriately clarifies NNSR 
applicability for major modifications and is consistent with EPA's 40 
CFR 51.165 requirements for state NNSR programs.

3. RCSA Section 22a-174-3a(l)(1)(C)

    CT DEEP revised this provision by adding the phrase ``for such a 
pollutant'' after ``nonattainment area.'' This revision clarifies that 
NNSR requirements apply only to nonattainment pollutants (and their 
precursors) at new major stationary sources and modifications at 
existing major stationary sources located in nonattainment areas. The 
revisions to 22a-174-3a(l)(1)(C) do not change NNSR applicability 
thresholds, offset obligations, or control technology requirements. EPA 
has determined that this revision clarifies NNSR applicability and is 
consistent with EPA's 40 CFR 51.165 requirements for state NNSR 
programs.

IV. Proposed Action

    EPA is proposing to approve Connecticut's October 3, 2024, SIP 
submittal that addresses revisions to RCSA section 22a-174-3a. EPA is 
soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this notice or on 
other relevant matters. These comments will be considered before taking 
final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal 
rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to this proposed 
rule by following the instructions listed in the ADDRESSES section of 
this Federal Register.

V. Incorporation by Reference

    In this rule, the EPA is proposing to include in a final EPA rule 
regulatory text that includes incorporation by reference. In accordance 
with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, the EPA is proposing to incorporate by 
reference the changes to RCSA section 22a-174-3a as adopted on March 
14, 2024, and discussed in Section II of this preamble. The EPA has 
made, and will continue to make, these documents generally available 
through <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> and at the EPA Region 1 Office 
(please contact the person identified in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION 
CONTACT section of this preamble for more information).

VI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

    Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a 
SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 
and applicable Federal regulations. See 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 
52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve 
state choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air 
Act. Accordingly, this proposed action merely approves state law as 
meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional 
requirements beyond those imposed by state law. For that reason, this 
proposed action:
    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review 
by the Office of Management and Budget under

[[Page 54611]]

Executive Orders 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993);
    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, 
February 6, 2025) because SIP actions are exempt from review under 
Executive Order 12866;
    <bullet> Does not impose an information collection burden under the 
provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);
    <bullet> Is certified as not having a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
    <bullet> Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);
    <bullet> Does not have federalism implications as specified in 
Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);
    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, 
April 23, 1997) because it approves a state program;
    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to 
Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and
    <bullet> Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the 
National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 
note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent 
with the Clean Air Act.
    In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian 
reservation land or in any other area where EPA or an Indian tribe has 
demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian 
country, the rule does not have tribal implications and will not impose 
substantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law as 
specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).
