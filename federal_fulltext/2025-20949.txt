SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Authority for This Rulemaking

    The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is 
found in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, Section 106 
describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, 
Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's 
authority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described 
in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, 
the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of 
the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the 
efficient use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority as it would modify Class E airspace to support IFR operations 
at Driggs/Reed Memorial Airport, ID.

Comments Invited

    The FAA invites interested persons to participate in this 
rulemaking by submitting written comments, data, or views. Comments are 
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, 
environmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal. The most 
helpful comments reference a specific portion of the proposal, explain 
the reason for any recommended change, and include supporting data. To 
ensure the docket does not contain duplicate comments, commenters 
should submit only one time if comments are filed electronically, or 
commenters should send only one copy of written comments if comments 
are filed in writing.
    The FAA will file in the docket all comments it receives, as well 
as a report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA 
personnel concerning this proposed rulemaking. Before acting on this 
proposal, the FAA will consider all comments it receives on or before 
the closing date for comments. The FAA will consider comments filed 
after the comment period has closed if it is possible to do so without 
incurring expense or delay. The FAA may change this proposal in light 
of the comments it receives.
    Privacy: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(c), DOT solicits comments 
from the public to better inform its rulemaking process. DOT posts 
these comments, without edit, including any personal information the 
commenter provides, to <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a>, as described in the system

Incorporation by Reference

    Class E5 airspace designations are published in paragraph 6005 of 
FAA Order JO 7400.11, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, which 
is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This 
document proposes to amend the current version of that order, FAA Order 
JO 7400.11K, dated August 4, 2025, and effective September 15, 2025. 
These updates would be published in the next update to FAA Order JO 
7400.11. FAA Order JO 7400.11K, which lists Class A, B, C, D, and E 
airspace areas, air traffic service routes, and reporting points, is 
publicly available as listed in the ADDRESSES section of this document.

The Proposal

    The FAA is proposing an amendment to 14 CFR part 71 that would 
modify the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the 
surface at Driggs/Reed Memorial Airport, ID. The Class E airspace 
surrounding the airport should be reduced due to modifications made to 
the airport's instrument flight procedures (IFP) that allow for more 
condensed containment within regulatory airspace.
    The northern extension should be narrowed by 4.3 miles and 
shortened by 5.5 miles to more appropriately contain the Area 
Navigation (RNAV) (Global Positioning System [GPS])-A approach 
procedure. The southwest extension should be narrowed by 1.3 miles, 
shortened by 1.3 miles, and shifted a half mile west to more 
appropriately contain the RNAV (GPS) Runway 4 approach procedure. The 
southeastern third of the existing airspace should be removed, as it is 
no longer needed for the containment of IFPs. The western portion of 
the airspace should be removed beyond the airport's 4.8-mile radius, 
approximately between the airport's 220[deg] and 315[deg] radials, as 
it's no longer needed for IFP containment.
    Finally, the airport's geographic location within its Class E 
airspace legal description should be updated to match the FAA's 
database.

Regulatory Notices and Analyses

    The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves 
an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and 
routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. 
It, therefore: (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under 
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); 
and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the 
anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that 
will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is 
certified that this proposed rule, when promulgated, will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Environmental Review

    This proposal will be subject to an environmental analysis in 
accordance with FAA Order 1050.1G, ``FAA National Environmental Policy 
Act Implementing Procedures'' prior to any FAA final regulatory action.
