-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to 
submit an information collection request (ICR), ``State Program 
Adequacy Determination: Municipal Solid Waste Landfills (MSWLFs) and 
Non-Municipal, Non-Hazardous Waste Disposal Units that Receive 
Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator (CESQG) Hazardous Waste'' 
(EPA ICR No. 1608.10, OMB Control No. 2050-0152) to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with 
the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). Before doing so, EPA is soliciting 
public comments on specific aspects of the proposed information 
collection as described in SUPPLEMENTARY

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a proposed extension of the ICR, 
which is currently approved through June 30, 2026. An agency may not 
conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number.
    This document allows 60 days for public comments. Supporting 
documents, which explain in detail the information that the EPA will be 
collecting, are available in the public docket for this ICR. The docket 
can be viewed online at <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> or in person at the 
EPA Docket Center, WJC West, Room 3334, 1301 Constitution Ave. NW, 
Washington, DC. The telephone number for the Docket Center is (202) 
566-1744. For additional information about EPA's public docket, visit 
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/dockets">https://www.epa.gov/dockets</a>.
    Pursuant to section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, EPA is soliciting 
comments and information to enable it to: (i) evaluate whether the 
proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the Agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; (ii) evaluate the accuracy of 
the Agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of 
information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions 
used; (iii) enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and (iv) minimize the burden of the 
collection of information on those who are to respond, including 
through the use of appropriate forms of information technology. EPA 
will consider the comments received and amend the ICR as appropriate. 
The final ICR package will then be submitted to OMB for review and 
approval. At that time, EPA will issue another Federal Register 
document to announce the submission of the ICR to OMB and the 
opportunity to submit additional comments to OMB.
    Abstract: Section 4010(c) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act (RCRA) of 1976 requires that EPA revise the landfill criteria 
promulgated under paragraph (1) of section 4004(a) and section 
1008(a)(3). Section 4005(c) of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous Solid 
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires states to develop and 
implement permit programs to ensure that MSWLFs and non-municipal, non-
hazardous waste disposal units that receive household hazardous waste 
or CESQG hazardous waste are in compliance with the revised criteria 
for the design and operation of non-municipal, non-hazardous waste 
disposal units under 40 CFR part 257, subpart B and MSWLFs under 40 CFR 
part 258 (40 CFR part 257, subpart B and 40 CFR part 258 are henceforth 
referred to as the ``revised federal criteria''). Section 4005(c) of 
RCRA further mandates the EPA Administrator to determine the adequacy 
of state permit programs to ensure owner and/or operator compliance 
with the revised federal criteria. A state program that is deemed 
adequate to ensure compliance may afford flexibility to owners or 
operators in the approaches they use to meet federal requirements, 
significantly reducing the burden associated with compliance.
    In response to the statutory requirement in section 4005(c) of 
RCRA, EPA developed 40 CFR part 239, commonly referred to as the State 
Implementation Rule (SIR). The SIR describes the state application and 
EPA review procedures and defines the elements of an adequate state 
permit program.
    The collection of information from the state during the permit 
program adequacy determination process allows EPA to evaluate whether a 
program for which approval is requested is appropriate in structure and 
authority to ensure owner or operator compliance with the revised 
federal criteria. The SIR does not require the use of a particular 
application form. Section 239.3 of the SIR, however, requires that all 
state applications contain the following five components:
    (1) A transmittal letter requesting permit program approval.
    (2) A narrative description of the state permit program, including 
a demonstration that the state's standards for non-municipal, non-
hazardous waste disposal units that receive CESQG hazardous waste are 
technically comparable to the 40 CFR part 257, subpart B criteria and/
or that its MSWLF standards are technically comparable to the 40 CFR 
part 258 criteria.
    (3) A legal certification demonstrating that the state has the 
authority to carry out the program.
    (4) Copies of state laws, regulations, and guidance that the state 
believes demonstrate program adequacy.
    (5) Copies of relevant state-tribal agreements if the state has 
negotiated with a tribe for the implementation of a permit program for 
non-municipal, non-hazardous waste disposal units that receive CESQG 
hazardous waste and/or MSWLFs on tribal lands.
    The EPA Administrator has delegated the authority to make 
determinations of adequacy, as contained in the statute, to the EPA 
Regional Administrator. The appropriate EPA Regional Office, therefore, 
will use the information provided by each state to determine whether 
the state's permit program satisfies the statutory test reflected in 
the requirements of 40 CFR part 239. In all cases, the information will 
be analyzed to determine the adequacy of the state's permit program for 
ensuring compliance with the federal revised criteria.
    Form numbers: None.
    Respondents/affected entities: State, Local, or Tribal Governments.
    Respondent's obligation to respond: Mandatory under section 4005(c) 
of RCRA.
    Estimated number of respondents: 12.
    Frequency of response: On occasion.
    Total estimated burden: 968 hours (per year). Burden is defined at 
5 CFR 1320.03(b).
    Total estimated cost: $41,674 (per year), which includes $41,674 
for annual labor and $0 for annualized capital or operation & 
maintenance costs. All costs are labor costs, there are no capital/
start-up or operation & maintenance costs associated with this ICR.
    Changes in the estimates: The burden hours are likely to stay 
substantially the same.
