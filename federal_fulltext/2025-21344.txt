Notice of Formal Determination on Records Release

AGENCY: Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board previously 
reviewed and made formal disclosure determinations on records related 
to civil rights cold case incident 2024-003-041 in which the Department 
of Justice proposed postponements. The Department later proposed 6 
additional postponements. On October 10, 2025, the Review Board 
determined that 63 pages in full and 43 pages in part produced by the 
Department of Justice should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights 
Cold Case Records Collection. By issuing this notice, the Review Board 
complies with the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 
that requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its 
determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the 
Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.
