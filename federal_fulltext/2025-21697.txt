Filing Information

    As a courtesy, we are making information related to sunset 
proceedings, including copies of the pertinent statute and Commerce's 
regulations, Commerce's schedule for Sunset Reviews, a listing of past 
revocations and continuations, and current service lists, available to 
the public on Commerce's website at the following address: <a href="https://enforcement.trade.gov/sunset/">https://enforcement.trade.gov/sunset/</a>. All submissions in these Sunset Reviews 
must be filed in accordance with Commerce's regulations regarding 
format, translation, and service of documents. These rules, including 
electronic filing requirements via Enforcement and Compliance's 
Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Centralized Electronic Service 
System (ACCESS), can be found at 19 CFR 351.303.
    In accordance with section 782(b) of the Act, any party submitting 
factual information in an AD/CVD proceeding must certify to the 
accuracy and completeness of that information. Parties must use the 
certification formats provided in 19 CFR 351.303(g). Commerce intends 
to reject factual submissions if the submitting party does not comply 
with applicable revised certification requirements.

Letters of Appearance and Administrative Protective Orders

    Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.103(d), Commerce will maintain and make 
available a public service list for these proceedings. Parties wishing 
to participate in any of these five-year reviews must file letters of 
appearance as discussed at 19 CFR 351.103(d). To facilitate the timely 
preparation of the public service list, it is requested that those 
seeking recognition as interested parties to a proceeding submit an 
entry of appearance within 10 days of the publication of the Notice of 
Initiation. Because deadlines in Sunset Reviews can be very short, we 
urge interested parties who want access to proprietary information 
under administrative protective order (APO) to file an APO application 
immediately following publication in the Federal Register of this 
notice of initiation. Commerce's regulations on submission of 
proprietary information and eligibility to receive access to business 
proprietary information under APO can be found at 19 CFR 351.304-306. 
Note that Commerce has temporarily modified certain of its requirements 
for serving documents containing business proprietary information, 
until further notice.\1\

to COVID-19, 85 FR 41363 (July 10, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information Required From Interested Parties

    Domestic interested parties, as defined in sections 771(9)(C), (D), 
(E), (F), and (G) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.102(b), wishing to 
participate in a Sunset Review must respond not later than 15 days 
after the date of publication in the Federal Register of this notice of 
initiation by filing a notice of intent to participate. The required 
contents of the notice of intent to participate are set forth at 19 CFR 
351.218(d)(1)(ii). In accordance with Commerce's regulations, if we do 
not receive a notice of intent to participate from at least one 
domestic interested party by the 15-day deadline, Commerce will 
automatically revoke the order without further review.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See 19 CFR 351.218(d)(1)(iii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If we receive an order-specific notice of intent to participate 
from a domestic interested party, Commerce's regulations provide that 
all parties wishing to participate in a Sunset Review must file 
complete substantive responses not later than 30 days after the date of 
publication in the Federal Register of this notice of initiation. The 
required contents of a substantive response, on an order-specific 
basis, are set forth at 19 CFR 351.218(d)(3). Note that certain 
information requirements differ for respondent and domestic parties. 
Also, note that Commerce's information requirements are distinct from 
the ITC 's information requirements. Consult Commerce's regulations for 
information regarding Commerce's conduct of Sunset Reviews. Consult 
Commerce's regulations at 19 CFR part 351 for definitions of terms and 
for other general information concerning AD and CVD proceedings at 
Commerce. Note that Commerce has amended certain of its requirements 
pertaining to the service of documents in 19 CFR 351.303(f).\3\ An 
electronically filed document must be received successfully in its 
entirety by ACCESS by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day on which it is 
due.

Procedures in Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings; Final 
Rule, 88 FR 67069 (September 29, 2023).

    In prior proceedings we have encouraged interested parties to 
provide

[[Page 55086]]

an executive summary of their comments, including footnotes. In these 
sunset reviews, we request that interested parties provide at the 
beginning of their comments, an executive summary for each issue raised 
in their comments. Further, we request that interested parties limit 
their public executive summary of each issue to no more than 450 words, 
not including citations. We intend to use the public executive 
summaries as the basis of the comment summaries included in the 
decision memorandum that will accompany the notice to be published in 
the Federal Register. Finally, we request that interested parties 
include footnotes for relevant citations in the public executive 
summary of each issue.

section 751(c) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.218(c).
