ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

40 CFR Part 52

[EPA-R03-OAR-2025-0226; FRL-13007-01-R3]


Air Plan Approval; Virginia; Repeal of Existing Stationary Source 
Regulations

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

ACTION: Proposed rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to 
approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision (Revision B23) 
submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The revision seeks to remove 
two existing stationary sources regulations, emission standards for 
petroleum refinery operations and emissions standards for large 
appliance coating application systems, from Virginia's SIP as there are 
no longer any applicable sources in Virginia. This action is being 
taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).

DATES: Written comments must be received on or before December 29, 
2025.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 20, 2024, the Virginia 
Department of Environmental Quality (VADEQ) submitted Revision B23 to 
its SIP. The revision seeks to repeal Article 11, Emission Standards 
for Petroleum Refinery Operations (9VAC5-40-1340 through 5-40-1510), 
and Article 26, Emissions Standards for Large Appliance Coating 
Application Systems (9VAC5-40-3560 through 5-40-3700) from existing 
stationary source regulations in the Virginia SIP, as there are no 
longer any facilities within the state subject to the regulations. 
Virginia has already repealed the regulations from the Virginia 
Administrative Code (VAC).

I. Background

    The CAA mandates that the EPA set national ambient air quality 
standards (NAAQS) for criteria pollutants, which are ozone and related 
photochemical oxidants, carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen oxides, 
particulate matter, and sulfur oxides. The CAA also requires the EPA to 
periodically review the relevant scientific information and the 
standards and revise them, if appropriate, to ensure that the standards 
provide the requisite protection for public health and the environment. 
The CAA requires states to develop a general plan to attain and 
maintain the standards in all areas of the country and a specific plan 
to attain the standards for each area designated nonattainment.
    In 1972, Virginia promulgated standards on emissions from Existing 
Stationary Sources (9VAC5-40). The articles pertaining to this 
rulemaking, Articles 11 and 26, establish regulations regarding 
petroleum refineries and large appliance coating application systems, 
respectively. Article 11 was promulgated in 1972 to control emissions 
of criteria pollutants, such as particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as well as hydrogen sulfide. Article 
26 was also promulgated in 1972 to control emissions of VOCs. The EPA 
adopted Article 11 and Article 26 into Virginia's SIP on April 21, 2000 
(65 FR 21315).

[[Page 54608]]

    Virginia state agencies are required to review regulations 
periodically in order to determine whether they are still needed. A 
public review of 9VAC5-40, including a review of the VADEQ's 
Comprehensive Environmental Data System database, demonstrated that 
there are no longer any facilities within the state subject to Article 
11, Emission Standards for Petroleum Refinery Operations, or Article 
26, Emissions Standards for Large Appliance Coating Application 
Systems.

II. Summary of SIP Revision and EPA Analysis

    On December 20, 2024, VADEQ submitted a SIP revision (Revision B23) 
consisting of amendments to Virginia's regulations regarding existing 
stationary sources (9VAC5-40). The revision proposes to repeal Article 
11, Emission Standards for Petroleum Refinery Operations (9VAC5-40-1340 
through 5-40-1510), and Article 26, Emissions Standards for Large 
Appliance Coating Application Systems (9VAC5-40-3560 through 5-40-
3700), from the Virginia SIP because there are no remaining petroleum 
refinery operations or large appliance coating application systems in 
Virginia. Additionally, any future such facilities constructed in 
Virginia would be subject to more stringent Federal and State 
regulations, such as New Source Review, than Articles 11 and 26 in 
9VAC5-40.
    Section 110(l) of the CAA indicates that the EPA cannot approve a 
SIP revision if the revision interferes with reasonable further 
progress (RFP), any NAAQS, or any other CAA requirement. Therefore, the 
EPA will approve a SIP revision that removes or modifies measures only 
after the state has demonstrated noninterference with RFP, the NAAQS, 
or any other CAA requirement. Virginia demonstrated noninterference 
through a review of 9VAC5-40 and VADEQ's Comprehensive Environmental 
Data System database, indicating that there are no longer any 
facilities subject to the articles proposed for removal. Additionally, 
the EPA confirmed that there are neither petroleum refineries nor large 
appliance coating application systems remaining in Virginia through the 
analysis of the most recently available emissions data.\1\ CAA section 
110(l) also states that a revision to an implementation plan submitted 
by a state shall be adopted by such state after reasonable notice and 
public hearing. Revision B23 meets such public notice and public 
hearing requirements through Virginia's certification of public 
participation activities and compliance with state administrative 
procedures document, which can be found in the docket of this 
rulemaking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 2020 National Emissions Inventory (NEI).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The removal of Articles 11 and 26 in 9VAC5-40 has no expected 
emissions impact on any pollutant because there are no existing 
affected facilities in Virginia and the removal of the regulations is 
not expected to interfere with reasonable further progress, any NAAQS, 
or any other CAA requirement. Therefore, the removal of Articles 11 and 
26 in 9VAC5-40 from the Virginia SIP is in accordance with section 
110(l) of the CAA.
    The regulations were repealed by Virginia's State Air Pollution 
Control Board on September 13, 2023. As the regulations have been 
repealed, they may be removed from Virginia's SIP.

III. Proposed Action

    The EPA is proposing to approve Revision B23, submitted on December 
20, 2024 by VADEQ, as a revision to the Virginia SIP, because the 
submission meets the requirements of CAA section 110. Revision B23 
repeals Article 11, Emission Standards for Petroleum Refinery 
Operations (9VAC5-40-1340 through 5-40-1510), and Article 26, Emissions 
Standards for Large Appliance Coating Application Systems (9VAC5-40-
3560 through 5-40-3700) from the Virginia SIP. The EPA is soliciting 
public comments on the issues discussed in this document. These 
comments will be considered before taking final action.

IV. General Information Pertaining to SIP Submittals From the 
Commonwealth of Virginia

    In 1995, Virginia adopted legislation that provides, subject to 
certain conditions, for an environmental assessment (audit) 
``privilege'' for voluntary compliance evaluations performed by a 
regulated entity. The legislation further addresses the relative burden 
of proof for parties either asserting the privilege or seeking 
disclosure of documents for which the privilege is claimed. Virginia's 
legislation also provides, subject to certain conditions, for a penalty 
waiver for violations of environmental laws when a regulated entity 
discovers such violations pursuant to a voluntary compliance evaluation 
and voluntarily discloses such violations to the Commonwealth and takes 
prompt and appropriate measures to remedy the violations. Virginia's 
Voluntary Environmental Assessment Privilege Law, Va. Code Sec. 10.1-
1198, provides a privilege that protects from disclosure documents and 
information about the content of those documents that are the product 
of a voluntary environmental assessment. The Privilege Law does not 
extend to documents or information that: (1) are generated or developed 
before the commencement of a voluntary environmental assessment; (2) 
are prepared independently of the assessment process; (3) demonstrate a 
clear, imminent and substantial danger to the public health or 
environment; or (4) are required by law.
    On January 12, 1998, the Commonwealth of Virginia Office of the 
Attorney General provided a legal opinion that states that the 
Privilege law, Va. Code Sec. 10.1-1198, precludes granting a privilege 
to documents and information ``required by law,'' including documents 
and information ``required by Federal law to maintain program 
delegation, authorization or approval,'' since Virginia must ``enforce 
federally authorized environmental programs in a manner that is no less 
stringent than their Federal counterparts. . . .'' The opinion 
concludes that ``[r]egarding Sec.  10.1-1198, therefore, documents or 
other information needed for civil or criminal enforcement under one of 
these programs could not be privileged because such documents and 
information are essential to pursuing enforcement in a manner required 
by Federal law to maintain program delegation, authorization or 
approval.''
    Virginia's Immunity law, Va. Code Sec. 10.1-1199, provides that 
``[t]o the extent consistent with requirements imposed by Federal 
law,'' any person making a voluntary disclosure of information to a 
state agency regarding a violation of an environmental statute, 
regulation, permit, or administrative order is granted immunity from 
administrative or civil penalty. The Attorney General's January 12, 
1998 opinion states that the quoted language renders this statute 
inapplicable to enforcement of any federally authorized programs, since 
``no immunity could be afforded from administrative, civil, or criminal 
penalties because granting such immunity would not be consistent with 
Federal law, which is one of the criteria for immunity.''
    Therefore, the EPA has determined that Virginia's Privilege and 
Immunity statutes will not preclude the Commonwealth from enforcing its 
program consistent with the Federal requirements. In any event, because 
the EPA has also determined that a state audit privilege and immunity 
law can affect only state enforcement and cannot have any impact on 
Federal enforcement authorities, the EPA may at any time invoke its 
authority under the

[[Page 54609]]

CAA, including, for example, sections 113, 167, 205, 211 or 213, to 
enforce the requirements or prohibitions of the state plan, 
independently of any state enforcement effort. In addition, citizen 
enforcement under section 304 of the CAA is likewise unaffected by 
this, or any, state audit privilege or immunity law.

V. Incorporation by Reference

    In this document, the EPA is proposing to include in a final EPA 
rule regulatory text that includes incorporation by reference. In 
accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, the EPA is proposing to 
incorporate by reference amendments to Virginia Administrative Code 
9VAC5-40 Existing Stationary Sources, repealing 9VAC5-40-1340 through 
9VAC5-40-1510, and 9VAC5-40-3560 through 9VAC5-40-3700, as described in 
section II of this document. The EPA has made, and will continue to 
make, these materials generally available through <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a> 
and at the EPA Region III Office (please contact the person identified 
in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this preamble for 
more information).

VI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

    Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a 
SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 
and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). 
Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, the EPA's role is to approve state 
choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. 
Accordingly, this action merely approves state law as meeting Federal 
requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those 
imposed by State law. For that reason, this action:
    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review 
by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (58 
FR 51735, October 4, 1993);
    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, 
February 6, 2025) because SIP actions are exempt from review under 
Executive Order 12866:
    <bullet> Does not impose an information collection burden under the 
provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);
    <bullet> Is certified as not having a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
    <bullet> Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);
    <bullet> Does not have federalism implications as specified in 
Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);
    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, 
April 23, 1997) because it approves a state program;
    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to 
Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and
    <bullet> Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the 
National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 
note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent 
with the Clean Air Act.
    In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian 
reservation land or in any other area where EPA or an Indian Tribe has 
demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian 
country, the rulemaking does not have Tribal implications and will not 
impose substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal 
law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 
2000).
