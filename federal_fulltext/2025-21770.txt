FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION

[Docket No. 25-07]


PKDC, LLC, Complainant v. COSCO Shipping Lines Co., Ltd., 
Respondent; Notice of Filing of Amended Complaint

    Notice is given that an amended complaint has been filed with the 
Federal Maritime Commission (the ``Commission'') by PKDC, LLC (the 
``Complainant'') against COSCO Shipping Lines Co., Ltd. (the 
``Respondent''). Complainant states that the Commission has subject-
matter jurisdiction over this complaint pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 40101 et 
seq., and personal jurisdiction over Respondent as an ocean common 
carrier, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(7), (9), and (18).
    Complainant is a limited liability company existing under the laws 
of the state of Colorado with its principal place of business in 
Denver, Colorado.
    Complainant identifies Respondent as a corporation organized under 
the laws of the People's Republic of China with its corporate 
headquarters in Shanghai, China, whose agent in the United States is 
COSCO Shipping Lines (North America) Inc. with its principal place of 
business in Secaucus, New Jersey.
    Complainant alleges that Respondent violated 46 U.S.C. 41102(c) and 
46 CFR 545.5. Complainant alleges these violations arose from the 
assessment of unjust and unreasonable demurrage and detention charges 
due to circumstances outside the control of Complainant, and other acts 
or omissions of Respondent.
    An answer to the amended complaint must be filed with the 
Commission within 25 days after the date of service.
    The full text of the amended complaint can be found in the 
Commission's electronic Reading Room at <a href="https://www2.fmc.gov/readingroom/proceeding/25-07/">https://www2.fmc.gov/readingroom/proceeding/25-07/</a>. This proceeding has been assigned to the 
Office of Administrative Law Judges. The initial decision of the 
presiding judge shall be issued by May 6, 2026, and the final decision 
of the Commission shall be issued by November 20, 2026.

(Authority: 46 U.S.C. 41301; 46 CFR 502.61(c))

    Served: November 28, 2025.
