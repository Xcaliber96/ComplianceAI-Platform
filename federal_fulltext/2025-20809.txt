DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

Office of the Secretary


Determination Pursuant to Section 102 of the Illegal Immigration 
Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, as Amended

AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, Department of Homeland Security.

ACTION: Notice of determination.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Secretary of Homeland Security has determined, pursuant to 
law, that it is necessary to waive certain laws, regulations, and other 
legal requirements in order to ensure the expeditious construction of 
barriers and roads in the vicinity of the international land border in 
the state of Texas.

DATES: This determination takes effect on November 25, 2025.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Important mission requirements of the 
Department of Homeland Security (``DHS'') include border security and 
the detection and prevention of illegal entry into the United States. 
Border security is critical to the nation's national security. 
Recognizing the critical importance of border security, Congress has 
mandated DHS to achieve and maintain operational control of the 
international land border. Secure Fence Act of 2006, Public Law 109-
367, section 2, 120 Stat. 2638 (Oct. 26, 2006) (8 U.S.C. 1701 note). 
Congress defined ``operational control'' as the prevention of all 
unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by 
terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, 
and other contraband. Id. Consistent with that mandate, the President's 
Executive Order on Securing Our Borders directs that I take all 
appropriate action to deploy and construct physical barriers to ensure 
complete operational control of the southern border of the United 
States. Executive Order 14165, section 3 (Jan. 20, 2025).
    Congress has provided to the Secretary of Homeland Security a 
number of authorities necessary to carry out DHS's border security 
mission. One of those authorities is found at section 102 of the 
Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, as 
amended (``IIRIRA''). Public Law 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009-546, 
3009-554 (Sept. 30, 1996) (8 U.S.C 1103 note), as amended by the REAL 
ID Act of 2005, Public Law 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231, 302, 306 (May 
11, 2005) (8 U.S.C. 1103 note), as amended by the Secure Fence Act of 
2006, Public Law 109-367, section 3, 120 Stat. 2638 (Oct.

26, 2006) (8 U.S.C. 1103 note), as amended by the Department of 
Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2008, Public Law 110-161, Div. E, 
Title V, section 564, 121 Stat. 2090 (Dec. 26, 2007). In section 102(a) 
of IIRIRA, Congress provided that the Secretary of Homeland Security 
shall take such actions as may be necessary to install additional 
physical barriers and roads (including the removal of obstacles to 
detection of illegal entrants) in the vicinity of the United States 
border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into 
the United States. In section 102(b) of IIRIRA, Congress mandated that 
in carrying out the authority of section 102(a), I provide for the 
installation of additional fencing, barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, 
and sensors to achieve and maintain operational control of the border. 
Finally, in section 102(c) of IIRIRA, Congress granted to the Secretary 
of Homeland Security the authority to waive all legal requirements that 
I, in my sole discretion, determine necessary to ensure the expeditious 
construction of barriers and roads authorized by section 102 of IIRIRA.

Determination and Waiver

Section 1

    The United States Border Patrol El Paso Sector is an area of high 
illegal entry. Between fiscal year 2021 and July 2025, Border Patrol 
apprehended over 1,229,400 illegal aliens attempting to enter the 
United States between border crossings in the El Paso Sector. In that 
same time period Border Patrol seized over 14,468 pounds of marijuana, 
over 1,347 pounds of cocaine, over 42 pounds of heroin, over 3,086 
pounds of methamphetamine, and over 254 pounds of fentanyl.
    Since the President took office, DHS has delivered the most secure 
border in history. More can and must be done, however. As the 
statistics cited above demonstrate, the El Paso Sector is an area of 
high illegal entry where illegal aliens regularly attempt to enter the 
United States and smuggle illicit drugs, and given my mandate to 
achieve and maintain operational control of the border, I must use my 
authority under section 102 of IIRIRA to install additional barriers 
and roads in the El Paso Sector. Therefore, DHS will take immediate 
action to construct additional barriers and roads in a segment of the 
border in the El Paso Sector. The segment where such construction will 
occur is referred to herein as the ``project area,'' which is more 
specifically described in Section 2 below.

Section 2

    I determine that the following area in the vicinity of the United 
States border, located in the State of Texas within the U. S. Border 
Patrol El Paso Sector, is an area of high illegal entry (the ``project 
area''): Starting at approximately the Texas-New Mexico State Line and 
extending south and east along the Rio Grande River to approximately 
GPS point 31.03, -105.57.
    There is presently an acute and immediate need to construct 
additional physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of 
the United States in order to prevent unlawful entries into the United 
States in the project area pursuant to section 102(a) and 102(b) of 
IIRIRA. In order to ensure the expeditious construction of additional 
physical barriers and roads in the project area, I have determined that 
it is necessary that I exercise the authority that is vested in me by 
section 102(c) of IIRIRA.
    Accordingly, pursuant to section 102(c) of IIRIRA, I hereby waive 
in their entirety, with respect to the construction of physical 
barriers and roads (including, but not limited to, accessing the 
project areas, creating and using staging areas, the conduct of 
earthwork, excavation, fill, and site preparation, and installation and 
upkeep of physical barriers, roads, supporting elements, drainage, 
erosion controls, safety features, lighting, cameras, and sensors) in 
the project area, all of the following statutes, including all federal, 
state, or other laws, regulations, and legal requirements of, deriving

    This waiver does not revoke or supersede any other waiver 
determination made pursuant to section 102(c) of IIRIRA. Such waivers 
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. I 
reserve the authority to execute further waivers from time to time as I 
may determine to be necessary under section 102 of IIRIRA.
