    Abstract: In order to effectuate the President's Executive Order 
14324 of July 30, 2025 (Suspending Duty-Free De Minimis Treatment For 
All Countries), which suspends the duty-free de minimis exemption 
provided under section 321(a)(2)(C) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended, for all products, regardless of country of origin, valued at 
$800 or less, and requires such articles, except those articles sent to 
the United States through the international postal network, to be 
subject to the formal or informal entry process, and establishes a new 
duty rate for international postal packages sent to the United States 
through the international postal network, the Secretary of Homeland 
Security has determined that appropriate action is needed to ensure 
collection of applicable duties as well as to modify the Harmonized 
Tariff

Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) as set out in the Annex to this 
notice.
    On January 20, 2025, the President declared a national emergency 
with respect to the grave threat to the United States posed by the 
influx of illegal aliens and drugs into the United States, in 
Proclamation 10886 (Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern 
Border of the United States). See National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 
1601 et seq.) (NEA).
    In Executive Order 14193 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To 
Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), the 
President declared a national emergency regarding the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the safety and security of Americans, including 
the public health crisis caused by fentanyl and other illicit drugs and 
the failure of Canada to do more to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise 
intercept drug trafficking organizations, other drug and human 
traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs. In that order, the 
President determined that it was necessary and appropriate to, among 
other things, suspend duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 
1321(a)(2)(C) for articles described in section 2(a) and section 2(b) 
of that order. In Executive Order 14226 of March 2, 2025 (Amendment to 
Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern 
Border), the President paused the suspension of duty-free de minimis 
treatment on such articles until the President received a notification 
from the Secretary of Commerce that adequate systems are in place to 
fully and expeditiously process and collect duties for such articles 
that would otherwise be eligible for duty-free de minimis treatment.
    In Executive Order 14194 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To 
Address the Situation at Our Southern Border), the President declared a 
national emergency regarding the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the safety and security of Americans, including the public health 
crisis caused by fentanyl and other illicit drugs and the failure of 
Mexico to do more to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept drug 
trafficking organizations, other drug and human traffickers, criminals 
at large, and illicit drugs. In that order, the President determined 
that it was necessary and appropriate to, among other things, suspend 
duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) for 
articles described in section 2(a) of that order. In Executive Order 
14227 of March 2, 2025 (Amendment to Duties To Address the Situation at 
Our Southern Border), the President paused the suspension of duty-free 
de minimis treatment on such articles until the President received a 
notification from the Secretary of Commerce that adequate systems are 
in place to fully and expeditiously process and collect duties for such 
articles that would otherwise be eligible for duty-free de minimis 
treatment.
    In Executive Order 14195 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To 
Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People's Republic of 
China), the President declared a national emergency regarding the 
unusual and extraordinary threat from the failure of the Government of 
the People's Republic of China (PRC) to arrest, seize, detain, or 
otherwise intercept chemical precursor suppliers, money launderers, 
other transnational criminal organizations, criminals at large, and 
illicit drugs. In that order, the President determined that it was 
necessary and appropriate to, among other things, suspend duty-free de 
minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) for articles described 
in section 2(a) of that order. In Executive Order 14200 of February 5, 
2025 (Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain 
in the People's Republic of China), the President paused the suspension 
of duty-free de minimis treatment for articles described in section 
2(a) of Executive Order 14195 until the President received a 
notification from the Secretary of Commerce that adequate systems are 
in place to fully and expeditiously process and collect duties for such 
articles that would otherwise be eligible for duty-free de minimis 
treatment.
    The President subsequently received notification from the Secretary 
of Commerce that adequate systems have been established to process and 
collect duties for articles of the PRC and Hong Kong that would 
otherwise be eligible for duty-free de minimis treatment, and in 
Executive Order 14256 of April 2, 2025 (Further Amendment to Duties 
Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People's Republic 
of China as Applied to Low-Value Imports), the President suspended 
duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) for 
products of the PRC and Hong Kong described in section 2(a) of 
Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14228 (Further 
Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the 
People's Republic of China). In addition, the President instructed the 
Secretary of Commerce to submit a report regarding the impact of 
Executive Order 14256 on American industries, consumers, and supply 
chains and to make recommendations for further action as he deems 
necessary.
    In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With 
a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large 
and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), the 
President declared a national emergency with respect to underlying 
conditions indicated by the large and persistent annual U.S. goods 
trade deficits. The President also provided that duty-free de minimis 
treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) would remain available for 
products described in section 3(a) of that order until the President 
received a notification by the Secretary of Commerce that adequate 
systems are in place to fully and expeditiously process and collect 
duties applicable for articles otherwise eligible for duty-free de 
minimis treatment.
    The Secretary of Commerce has notified the President that adequate 
systems are now in place to fully and expeditiously process and collect 
duties for articles otherwise eligible for duty-free de minimis 
treatment on a global basis, including for products described in 
section 2(a) and section 2(b) of Executive Order 14193, section 2(a) of 
Executive Order 14194, and section 3(a) of Executive Order 14257.
    As stated in the President's Executive Order 14324 of July 30, 2025 
(Suspending Duty-Free De Minimis Treatment For All Countries), the 
President determined that it is still necessary and appropriate to 
suspend duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) in 
the manner and for the articles described below to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threats, which have their source in whole or 
substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
    In Executive Order 14193 the President determined that it is 
necessary and appropriate to suspend duty-free de minimis treatment 
under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) for certain Canadian goods to deal with 
the emergency declared in Executive Order 14193, as amended. In the 
President's judgment, this suspension is necessary and appropriate to 
ensure that the tariffs imposed by Executive Order 14193, as amended, 
are effective in addressing the emergency declared in Executive Order 
14193 and that the purpose of this action and other actions to address 
the emergency declared in Executive Order 14193 is not undermined. For 
example, many shippers go to great lengths to evade law enforcement and 
hide illicit substances in imports that go through international

[[Page 55152]]

commerce. These shippers conceal the true contents of shipments sent to 
the United States through deceptive shipping practices. Some of the 
techniques employed by these shippers to conceal the true contents of 
the shipments, the identity of the distributors, and the country of 
origin of the imports include the use of re-shippers in the United 
States, false invoices, fraudulent postage, and deceptive packaging. 
The risks of evasion, deception, and illicit-drug importation are 
particularly high for low-value articles that have been eligible for 
duty-free de minimis treatment.
    Independently, the President also determined that it is necessary 
and appropriate to suspend duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 
U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) for certain Mexican goods to deal with the 
emergency declared in Executive Order 14194, as amended. In the 
President's judgment, and for substantially similar reasons as above, 
this suspension is necessary and appropriate to ensure that the tariffs 
imposed by Executive Order 14194, as amended, are effective in 
addressing the emergency declared in Executive Order 14194 and that the 
purpose of this action and other actions to address the emergency 
declared in Executive Order 14194 is not undermined.
    Independently, and after considering information newly provided by 
the Secretary of Commerce, among other things, the President determined 
that it is still necessary and appropriate to continue to suspend duty-
free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) for certain 
goods of the PRC and Hong Kong to deal with the emergency declared in 
Executive Order 14195, as amended. In the President's judgment, and for 
substantially similar reasons as above, this suspension is still 
necessary and appropriate to ensure that the tariffs imposed by 
Executive Order 14195, as amended, are effective in addressing the 
emergency declared in Executive Order 14195 and that the purpose of 
this action and other actions to address the emergency declared in 
Executive Order 14195 is not undermined.
    Also independently, the President determined that it is necessary 
and appropriate to suspend duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 
U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) on a global basis to deal with the emergency 
declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended. In the President's 
judgment, this suspension is necessary and appropriate to ensure that 
the tariffs imposed by Executive Order 14257, as amended, are not 
evaded and are effective in addressing the emergency declared in 
Executive Order 14257 and that the purpose of this action and other 
actions to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 is 
not undermined.
    The following modified information collection listed below is being 
submitted to OMB for consideration of approval on an emergency 
clearance, with the justification of an unanticipated event and reasons 
to believe following the normal PRA process is likely to prevent or 
disrupt the collection of information and cause public harm.
