and Budget (OMB) for each collection of information they conduct or 
sponsor. The term ``collection of information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 
3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and includes agency requests or 
requirements that members of the public submit reports, keep records, 
or provide information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the 
PRA requires federal agencies to publish a 60-day notice in the Federal 
Register concerning each proposed collection of information, including 
each proposed extension or reinstatement of an existing collection of 
information, before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, CMS is publishing this notice.

Information Collections

    1. Type of Information Collection Request: Revision with change of 
a currently approved collection; Title of Information Collection: 
National Implementation of the Outpatient and Ambulatory Surgery 
Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (OAS CAHPS); 
Use: The Agency for Healthcare Research an Quality (AHRQ) and its 
Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS[supreg]) 
Consortium, in conjunction with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services (CMS), have developed standardized CAHPS Surveys and tools for 
a variety of patient populations, including commercially insured 
ambulatory patients, patients whose care is covered by Medicare and 
Medicaid, dialysis patients, home health patients, hospital inpatients, 
dental patients, and patients who receive behavioral health care and 
services. The purpose of the CAHPS family of surveys is to collect data 
about patients' assessment and rating of the care they receive from 
their health care provider or health care system.
    The national implementation of OAS CAHPS is designed to allow 
third-party, CMS- approved survey vendors to administer OAS CAHPS using 
mail-only, telephone-only, mixed mode (mail with telephone follow-up), 
mixed-mode (web with mail follow-up), or mixed-mode (web with telephone 
follow-up). The CMS-approved survey vendors who administer the survey 
use an electronic data collection system if they administer a 
telephone-only or mixed-mode survey using web. Form Number: CMS-10500 
(OMB control number: 0938-1240); Frequency: Once; Affected Public: 
Business or other for-profits and Not-for-profits institutions; Number 
of Respondents: 2,045,727; Total Annual Responses: 2,045,727; Total 
Annual Hours: 500,805. (For policy questions regarding this collection 
contact Memuna Ifedirah 410-786-6849.)
    2. Type of Information Collection Request: Extension of a currently 
approved collection; Title of Information Collection: Elimination of 
Cost-Sharing for Full Benefit Dual-Eligible Individuals Receiving Home 
and Community-Based Services; Use: Section 1860 D-14 of the Social 
Security Act (the Act) sets forth requirements for premium and cost-
sharing subsidies for low-income beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare 
Part D. Based on this statute, 42 CFR 423.771, provides guidance 
concerning limitations for payments made by and on behalf of low-income 
Medicare beneficiaries who enroll in Part D plans. 42 CFR 423.771(b) 
establishes requirements for determining a beneficiary's eligibility 
for full subsidy under the Part D program. Regulations set forth in 
Sec. Sec.  423.780 and 423.782 outline premium and cost sharing 
subsidies to which full subsidy eligible are entitled under the Part D 
program.
    Each month CMS deems individuals automatically eligible for the 
full subsidy, based on data from State Medicaid Agencies and the Social 
Security Administration (SSA). The SSA sends a monthly file of 
Supplementary Security Income-eligible beneficiaries to CMS. Similarly, 
the State Medicaid agencies submit Medicare Modernization Act files to 
CMS that identify full subsidy beneficiaries. CMS deems the 
beneficiaries as having full subsidy and auto-assigns these 
beneficiaries to benchmark Part D plans. Part D plans to receive 
premium amounts based on the monthly assessments. Form Number: CMS-
10344 (OMB control number: 0938-1127); Frequency: Monthly; Affected 
Public: State, Local, or Tribal Governments and Not-for-profits 
institutions; Number of Respondents: 51; Total Annual Responses: 51; 
Total Annual Hours: 612. (For policy questions regarding this 
collection contact Roland Herrera 410-786-0668.)
