Background

    On August 21, 2025, (Postal Bulletin 22683) the Postal Service 
revised DMM 609.1.4 to reduce the insured mail ``No Sooner Than'' 
filing date to 6 days, effective November 3, 2025.

Proposal

    After further evaluation of this revision, the Postal Service is 
proposing to re-establish the ``No Sooner Than'' filing date of 15 days 
for filing insured mail claims to re-align the filing thresholds with 
other mail service and bulk claims.
    The Postal Service is proposing to implement this change effective 
January 18, 2026.
    Although exempt from the notice and comment requirements of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b), (c)) regarding proposed 
rulemaking by 39 U.S.C. 410(a), the Postal Service invites public 
comment on the proposed revisions to Mailing Standards of the United 
States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM), incorporated by 
reference in the Code of Federal Regulations.
    We will publish an appropriate amendment to 39 CFR part 111 to 
reflect these changes.

List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 111

    Administrative practice and procedure, Postal Service.

    Accordingly, the Postal Service proposes the following changes to 
Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail 
Manual (DMM), incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal 
Regulations (see 39 CFR 111.1):
