SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD

[Docket No. FD 36878]


Fortress Investment Group LLC--Control Exemption--Wheeling & Lake 
Erie Railway Company and Akron Barberton Cluster Railway Company

    On August 28, 2025, Fortress Investment Group LLC (Fortress), a 
noncarrier, filed a petition under 49 U.S.C. 10502, seeking an 
exemption from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11323 for 
the benefit of FTAI Infrastructure, Inc. (FTAI Infrastructure), Percy 
Acquisition LLC (PALLC), FIP RR Holding Company LLC

[[Page 55327]]

(FIP HoldCo), and FIP RR Holdings LLC (FIPRR), which are all managed by 
an affiliate of Fortress, to acquire control of The Wheeling 
Corporation, a noncarrier, and (indirectly) its wholly owned 
subsidiaries, Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway Company (W&LE), a Class II 
rail carrier, and Akron Barberton Cluster Railway Company (ABC), a 
Class III rail carrier. The Board will grant Fortress's petition for 
exemption, subject to standard labor protective conditions.

Background

    Fortress explains that its affiliate manages FTAI Infrastructure. 
(Pet. 4.) FTAI Infrastructure owns 99% of PALLC, which in turn controls 
Transtar, LLC (Transtar). (Pet. 4.) \1\ Transtar currently owns and 
directly controls six non-connecting Class III rail carriers. (Id. at 
2, 8.) \2\ W&LE operates over approximately 982 miles of track in Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Maryland. (Id. at 7.) ABC operates 
over approximately 84 miles of track in the vicinity of Akron, Ohio. 
(Id. at 7-8.) \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ PALLC also owns 100% of FIP HoldCo, and that entity owns 
100% of FIPRR. (Id.)
    \2\ Those carriers are: Union Railroad Company, LLC (URR); Gary 
Railway Company, LLC; Delray Connecting Railroad Company; Texas & 
Northern Railway Company, LLC; The Lake Terminal Railroad Company, 
LLC; and East Ohio Valley Railway, LLC. (Id. at 4.)
    \3\ One of the Transtar railroads, URR, connects with W&LE at 
Mifflin Junction, Pa., and Clairton, Pa. For that reason, Fortress 
sought Board authority via petition for exemption rather than the 
class exemption at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2), which applies only to 
nonconnecting carriers. (Id. at 6.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated August 6, 2025, FIPRR 
acquired, on August 25, 2025, 100% of the equity interests in The 
Wheeling Corporation, which holds 100% of the equity interests in W&LE 
and ABC. Immediately upon closing, the shares of The Wheeling 
Corporation were deposited into an independent voting trust pursuant to 
49 CFR part 1013 pending the Board's consideration of the petition for 
exemption. (Pet. 7.) \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Fortress submitted the voting trust agreement to the Board 
on August 25, 2025.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If the transaction is approved and the voting trust is dissolved, 
Fortress may be deemed to control (in addition to Transtar's six 
existing rail carriers) W&LE and ABC upon their becoming indirect 
subsidiaries of FTAI Infrastructure and PALLC. (Pet. 7.) FIPRR will 
directly control, and FIP Holdco, PALLC, and FTAI Infrastructure will 
indirectly control, The Wheeling Corporation, W&LE, and ABC. (Id.)
    In support of its exemption request, Fortress asserts that granting 
an exemption will further several goals of the Rail Transportation 
Policy (RTP) under 49 U.S.C. 10101. (Pet. 14-15.) Fortress explains 
that, among other things, the transaction will enable W&LE and ABC to 
benefit from the financial strength of FTAI Infrastructure and PALLC. 
(Id. at 15.) Fortress also asserts that the transaction will not lead 
to higher rates or reduced service and that W&LE and ABC will continue 
to provide freight rail service over their respective lines. (Id.)
    Although W&LE and URR share a common customer in the vicinity of 
Mifflin Junction, Fortress claims that they do not compete for the same 
traffic from that customer and that the customer supports the 
transaction. (Id. at 15-16.) That customer, TMS International, LLC 
(TMS), filed a statement in support of the transaction on September 8, 
2025.

Discussion and Conclusions

    The acquisition of control of a rail carrier by a person that is 
not a rail carrier but that controls any number of rail carriers 
requires prior approval from the Board under 49 U.S.C. 11323(a)(5). 
Under 49 U.S.C. 10502(a), however, the Board shall, to the maximum 
extent consistent with 49 U.S.C. subtitle IV, part A, exempt a 
transaction or service from regulation when it finds that: (1) the 
regulation is not necessary to carry out the RTP under 49 U.S.C. 10101; 
and (2) either (a) the transaction or service is of limited scope, or 
(b) regulation is not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of 
market power.
    An exemption from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 
11323-25 in this case is consistent with the standards of 49 U.S.C. 
10502. Detailed scrutiny of the proposed transaction through an 
application for review and approval under sections 49 U.S.C. 11323-25 
is not necessary to carry out the RTP. Permitting Fortress's 
acquisition without having to file an application would promote the RTP 
by minimizing the need for federal regulatory control over the proposed 
transaction, 49 U.S.C. 10101(2); reducing regulatory barriers to entry 
into and exit from the industry, 49 U.S.C. 10101(7); and providing for 
the expeditious resolution of this proceeding, 49 U.S.C. 10101(15). The 
transaction would also enhance W&LE's and ABC's access to capital and 
hence facilitate future strategic investment decisions and growth 
opportunities. (Pet. 15.) As a result, granting an exemption would 
promote a safe and efficient rail transportation system, 49 U.S.C. 
10101(3); ensure the continuation of a sound rail transportation 
system, 49 U.S.C. 10101(4); and foster sound economic conditions in 
transportation, 49 U.S.C. 10101(5). Lastly, as discussed below, the 
Board finds that there would be no significant impacts on competition 
as a result of the transaction. Accordingly, other aspects of the RTP 
would not be adversely affected.
    Regulation of the proposed transaction is not necessary to protect 
shippers from an abuse of market power.\5\ Although URR connects with 
W&LE and they would come under common control through the transaction, 
the record here does not suggest any reason for concern about reduced 
competition. Fortress explains that the common shipper, TMS, would not 
experience an actual reduction because W&LE and URR do not compete for 
the same TMS traffic. (Pet. 17.) W&LE moves scrap metal to facilities 
in Mingo Junction, Ohio, and Cleveland, Ohio via entirely W&LE local 
movements, while URR handles scrap metal heading east to a steel works 
in Braddock, Pa., an entirely local URR move, as well as for 
interchange to carriers other than W&LE. (Id. at 16-17.) Given their 
respective route structures, neither W&LE nor URR is capable of 
handling the TMS local movements currently served by the other carrier. 
(Id. at 17.) TMS also supports the transaction and asks the Board to 
``promptly approve'' it so that the shipper ``can take full advantage 
of benefits that will result.'' (See TMS Letter 1, Sept. 8, 2025.) 
There were no filings in opposition to the transaction. Based on the 
record, the Board finds that the transaction meets the requirements for 
an exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10502.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Given this finding, the Board need not determine whether the 
transaction is limited in scope. See 49 U.S.C. 10502(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under 49 U.S.C. 10502(g), the Board may not use its exemption 
authority to relieve a rail carrier of its statutory obligation to 
protect the interests of its employees. Because the transaction 
involves one Class II and one or more Class III rail carriers, the 
exemption will be made subject to the labor protection requirements of 
49 U.S.C. 11326(b) and Wisconsin Central Ltd.--Acquisition Exemption--
Lines of Union Pacific Railroad, 2 S.T.B. 218 (1997).
    The acquisition of control is exempt from environmental reporting 
requirements under 49 CFR 1105.6(c)(1) because it will not result in 
significant changes in carrier operations. Similarly, under 49 CFR 
1105.8(b)(3), no historic reporting is required because the proposed 
transaction will not substantially change the level of operations or 
maintenance of railroad properties.

    It is ordered:
    1. Under 49 U.S.C. 10502, the Board exempts the above transaction 
from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11323-25, subject to 
the employee protective conditions in Wisconsin Central Ltd.--
Acquisition Exemption--Lines of Union Pacific Railroad, 2 S.T.B. 218 
(1997).
    2. Notice of this exemption will be published in the Federal 
Register.
    3. The exemption will become effective on December 26, 2025. 
Petitions for stay must be filed by December 5, 2025. Petitions to 
reopen must be filed by December 16, 2025.

    Decided: November 26, 2025.

    By the Board, Board Members, Fuchs, Hedlund, and Schultz.
Zantori Dickerson,
Clearance Clerk.
