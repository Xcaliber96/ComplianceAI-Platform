Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Initiation of 5-
Year Status Reviews for 66 Southeastern Species

AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

ACTION: Notice of initiation of reviews; request for information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are initiating 5-year 
status reviews under the Endangered Species Act for 66 animal and plant 
species. A 5-year review is an assessment of the best scientific and 
commercial data available at the time of the review to ensure the 
accuracy of the species' classification as endangered or threatened. We 
are requesting submission of any such information that has become 
available since the previous status review for each species.

DATES: To ensure consideration of your information in our reviews, we 
must receive your comments or information

[[Page 53384]]

on or before January 26, 2026. However, we will continue to accept new 
information about any of the species at any time.

ADDRESSES: For instructions on how to submit information for a species, 
see table 1 in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: To request information on specific 
species, contact the appropriate person in the table in the 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section or, for general information, contact 
Bradly Potter, via phone at 517-643-7965, via email at 
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#51332330353d280e213e25253423113726227f363e27"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7d1f0f1c191104220d120909180f3d1b0a0e531a120b">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, or via U.S. mail at U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, 1875 Century Boulevard, Atlanta, GA 30345. Individuals in the 
United States who are deaf, deafblind, hard of hearing, or have a 
speech disability may dial 711 (TTY, TDD, or TeleBraille) to access 
telecommunications relay services. Individuals outside the United 
States should use the relay services offered within their country to 
make international calls to the point-of-contact in the United States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are 
initiating 5-year status reviews under the Endangered Species Act of 
1973, as amended (ESA; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), for 34 animal species 
and 32 plant species. A 5-year status review is based on the best 
scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review. 
Therefore, we are requesting submission of any such information that 
has become available since the last review for the species, 
particularly information on the status, threats, and recovery of the 
species.

Why do we conduct a 5-year review?

    Under the ESA, we maintain Lists of Endangered and Threatened 
Wildlife and Plants (which we collectively refer to as the List) in 
title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 50 CFR 17.11 (for 
wildlife) and 50 CFR 17.12 (for plants). Section 4(c)(2)(A) of the ESA 
requires us to review each listed species' status at least once every 5 
years. Our regulation at 50 CFR 424.21 requires that we publish a 
notice in the Federal Register announcing that a species is under 
active review; however, we may review the status of the species at any 
time based upon a petition or other information available to us. For 
additional information about 5-year reviews, refer to our fact sheet at 
<a href="https://www.fws.gov/project/five-year-status-reviews">https://www.fws.gov/project/five-year-status-reviews</a>.

What information do we consider in our review?

    A 5-year review considers the best scientific and commercial data 
that have become available since the current listing determination or 
most recent status review of each species, such as:
    (A) Species biology, including but not limited to population 
trends, distribution, abundance, demographics, habitat requirements, 
tolerance thresholds, and genetics;
    (B) Habitat conditions, including but not limited to amount, 
distribution, and suitability;
    (C) Conservation measures that have been or are planned to be 
implemented to benefit the species;
    (D) Current threats and trends in relation to the five listing 
factors (as defined in section 4(a)(1) of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 
1533(a)(1)); and
    (E) Other new information, data, or corrections, including but not 
limited to taxonomic or nomenclatural changes, identification of 
erroneous information contained in the List, and improved analytical 
methods.
    New information will be considered in the 5-year review and ongoing 
recovery programs for the species.

Which species are under review?

    This notice announces 5-year status reviews for the species listed 
in table 1.
