SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[OMB Control No. 3235-0211]


Agency Information Collection Activities; Comment Request; 
Extension: Rule 18f-1 and Form N-18f-1

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 350l-3520), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget a request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.

[[Page 54792]]

    Rule 18f-1 (17 CFR 270.18f-1) enables a registered open-end 
management investment company (``fund'') that may redeem its securities 
in-kind, by making a one-time election, to commit to make cash 
redemptions pursuant to certain requirements without violating section 
18(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-18(f)). A 
fund relying on the rule must file Form N-18F-1 (17 CFR 274.51) to 
notify the Commission of this election. The Commission staff estimates 
that 8 funds file Form N-18F-1 annually, and that each response takes 
one hour. Based on these estimates, the total annual burden hours 
associated with the rule is estimated to be 8 hours. The estimated 
burden hours associated with rule 18f-1 and Form 18F-1 have decreased 
by 4 hours from the current allocation of 12 hours. This decrease is 
due to a decrease in the estimated number of investment companies 
filing Form N-18F-1 annually. There is no external cost associated with 
this collection of information.
    The estimate of average burden hours is made solely for the 
purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and is not derived from a 
comprehensive or even a representative survey or study of the costs of 
Commission rules. The collection of information required by rule 18f-1 
is necessary to obtain the benefits of the rule. Responses to the 
collection of information will not be kept confidential.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB Control Number.
    The public may view and comment on this information collection 
request at: <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202509-3235-006">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202509-3235-006</a> or send an email comment to

    Dated: November 24, 2025.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
