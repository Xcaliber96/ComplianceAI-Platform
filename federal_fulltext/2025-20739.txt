SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[OMB Control No. 3235-0410]


Agency Information Collection Activities; Submission for OMB 
Review;

Comment Request; Extension: Rules 17h-1T and 17h-2T

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC or ``Commission'') is submitting to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') this request for an extension of the 
proposed collection of information in Rules 17h-1T and 17h-2T.
    Rule 17h-1T requires a covered broker-dealer to maintain and 
preserve records and other information concerning certain entities that 
are associated with the broker-dealer. This requirement extends to the 
financial and securities activities of the holding company, affiliates 
and subsidiaries of the broker-dealer that are reasonably likely to 
have a material impact on the financial or operational condition of the 
broker-dealer. Rule 17h-2T requires a covered broker-dealer to file 
with the Commission quarterly reports and a cumulative year-end report 
concerning the information required to be maintained and preserved 
under Rule 17h-1T.
    The collection of information required by Rules 17h-1T and 17h-2T, 
collectively referred to as the ``risk assessment rules'', is mandatory 
and is necessary to enable the Commission to monitor the activities of 
a broker-dealer affiliate whose business activities are reasonably 
likely to have a material impact on the financial and operational 
condition of the broker-dealer. Without this information, the 
Commission would be unable to assess the potentially damaging impact of 
the affiliate's activities on the broker-dealer.
    There are currently 238 respondents that must comply with Rules 
17h-1T and 17h-2T. Each of these 238 respondents are estimated to 
require 10 hours per year to maintain the records required under Rule 
17h-1T, for an aggregate estimated annual burden of 2,380 hours (238 
respondents - 10 hours). In addition, each of these 238 respondents 
must make five annual responses under Rule 17h-2T. These five responses 
are estimated to require 14 hours per respondent per year for an 
aggregate estimated annual burden of 3,332 hours (238 respondents x 14 
hours).
    In addition, new respondents must draft an organizational chart 
required under Rule 17h-1T and establish a system for complying with 
the risk assessment rules. The staff estimates that drafting the 
required organizational chart requires one hour and establishing a 
system for complying with the risk assessment rules requires three 
hours. Based on the reduction in the number of filers in recent years, 
the staff estimates there will be four new respondents, and thus, a 
corresponding estimated burden of four hours for new respondents.
    In addition, the Commission adopted amendments in 2024 that require 
broker-dealers subject to Rule 17h-2T to file Form 17h-2T 
electronically on EDGAR and that would require a portion of the form to 
be filed using Inline XBRL. Thus, the Commission estimates an average 
additional burden of 2 hour per response four times a year (quarterly) 
for 238 respondents, resulting in a total industrywide burden of 1,904 
hours \1\ per year for Form 17-H filers to structure their financial 
statements (Item 4 of Form 17-H) in Inline XBRL. The total compliance 
burden per year is approximately 7,620 burden hours (2,380 hours + 
3,332 hours + 4 hours + 1,904 hours).\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ (238 respondents x 8 hours = 1,904 hours.)
    \2\ The Commission recently extended the compliance date for 
certain of the 2024 rule amendments by twelve months. See Extension 
of Compliance Dates for Electronic Submission of Certain Materials 
Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; Amendments Regarding the 
FOCUS Report; SEC Release Nos. 33-11386; 34-103877; IC-35738; (Sept. 
8, 2025); 90 FR 43552 (Sept. 10, 2025) (File No. S7-08-23).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On September 12, 2025, the Commission published a Federal Register 
notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on this 
collection of information. One comment letter was received. The comment 
letter supports the Commission's recent extension of the compliance 
date for the 2024 amendments and agrees with the collection of data in 
Inline XBRL format. The comment letter does not discuss the estimated 
burdens for the collection of

information, and changes were not made to the estimated burdens in 
connection with the comment letter.\3\

to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB Control Number.
