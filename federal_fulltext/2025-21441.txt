DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement

30 CFR Parts 816 and 817

[Docket No. OSM-2025-0010; S1D1S SS08011000 SX064A000 256S180110; S2D2S 
SS08011000 SX064A000 25XS501520]
RIN 1029-AC92


Rescission of Portions of Permanent Program Performance Standards 
Related to Siltation Structures

AGENCY: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Interior.

ACTION: Direct final rule; request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This direct final rule revises the Federal regulations to 
remove paragraphs that required that all surface drainage from the 
disturbed area pass through a siltation structure before leaving the 
permit area. These paragraphs were struck down on judicial review 
because the court found that the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation 
and Enforcement (OSMRE) had not articulated a sufficient basis for the 
rule under the Administrative Procedure Act and that OSMRE had not 
sufficiently demonstrated that siltation structures were the best 
technology currently available.

DATES: The final rule is effective January 27, 2026, unless significant 
adverse comments are received by December 29, 2025. If significant 
adverse comments are received, notice will be published in the Federal 
Register before the effective date either withdrawing the rule or 
issuing a new final rule which responds to significant adverse 
comments.

ADDRESSES: You may submit comments by one of the following methods:
    <bullet> Electronically: Go to the Federal eRulemaking Portal: 
<a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> and search for Docket Number OSM-2025-0010.

access telecommunications relay services. Individuals outside the 
United States should use the relay services offered within their 
country to make international calls to the point-of-contact in the 
United States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paragraphs (b)(1) from both 30 CFR 816.46 
and 30 CFR 817.46 require that ``additional contributions of suspended 
solids sediment to streamflow or runoff outside the permit area shall 
be prevented to the extent possible using best technology currently 
available.'' Paragraphs (b)(2) of sections 816.46 and 817.46 required 
that all surface drainage from the disturbed area pass through a 
siltation structure before leaving the permit area. Forty years ago, 
paragraphs (b)(2) of sections 816.46 and 817.46 were struck down on 
judicial review because the court found that OSMRE had not articulated 
a sufficient basis for the rule under the Administrative Procedure Act 
and that OSMRE had not sufficiently demonstrated that siltation 
structures were the best technology currently available in every case. 
See In re Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation, 620 F. Supp. 
1519, 1566-1568 (D.D.C. 1985).
    In response to the court's holding, OSMRE suspended paragraphs 
(b)(2) from both 30 CFR 816.46 and 30 CFR 817.46 on November 20, 1986, 
but did not remove them from the Code of Federal Regulations. 51 FR 
41961 (Nov. 20, 1986). To avoid confusion that might result from the 
continuing publication of those rules in the Federal regulations, over 
a decade later, OSMRE attempted to remove paragraphs (b)(2) from 
sections 816.46 and 817.46 and redesignate the remaining paragraphs of 
those sections accordingly. 73 FR 75814, 75854 (Dec. 12, 2008). At that 
time, however, OSMRE omitted the words ``lift the suspension'' prior to 
directing the removal of the paragraphs, which had the effect of 
rendering the removal of those paragraphs inoperable. On September 29, 
2010, OSMRE published technical amendments, that among other things 
lifted the suspension and removed the paragraphs. 75 FR 60272. However, 
when the Stream Buffer Rule was vacated, a final rule was published 
that erroneously reinstated the suspended provisions from the 2008 rule 
albeit with a sentence noting the suspension instead of an actual 
suspension. See, e.g., 79 FR 76227 (Dec. 22, 2014). OSMRE attempted to 
remove the provisions again as part of the Stream Protection Rule. 81 
FR 93392 (Dec. 20, 2016). However, that rule was later disapproved by 
Congress and the prior language was reinstated. 82 FR 54979 (Nov. 17, 
2017).
    Upon reviewing these regulations, the 1985 court decision, and the 
various Federal Register notices attempting to rescind these 
regulations, OSMRE has determined that they should finally be rescinded 
because they were struck down upon judicial review and paragraph (b)(1) 
in sections 816.46 and 817.46 ensure that the best technology currently 
available, which may include siltation structures, is used to prevent, 
to the extent possible, additional contributions of suspended solids 
sediment to streamflow or runoff outside the permit area. Additionally, 
because the suspension was lifted in 2010, no further action is 
necessary to lift the suspension at this time. This reason, 
independently and alone, justifies rescission of paragraphs (b)(2) from 
both 30 CFR 816.46 and 30 CFR 817.46. OSMRE has no interest in 
maintaining regulations that have been struck down by court order.
    The Department is issuing this rule as a direct final rule. 
Although the Administrative Procedure Act (APA, 5 U.S.C. 551-559) 
generally requires agencies to engage in notice and comment rulemaking, 
section 553 of the APA provides an exception when the agency ``for good 
cause finds'' that notice and comment are ``impracticable, unnecessary, 
or contrary to the public interest.'' Id. Sec.  553(b)(B). The 
Department has determined that notice and comment are unnecessary 
because this rule is noncontroversial; of a minor, technical nature; 
involves no agency discretion; and is unlikely to receive any 
significant adverse comments. Significant adverse comments are those 
that oppose the recission of the rule and raise, alone or in 
combination, (1) reasons why the recission of the rule is 
inappropriate, including challenges to the recission's underlying 
premise, or (2) serious unintended consequences of the recission. A 
comment recommending an addition to the rule will not be considered 
significant and adverse unless the comment explains how this direct 
final rule would be ineffective without the addition.

Procedural Determinations

Executive Order 12630--Governmental Actions and Interference With 
Constitutionally Protected Property Rights

    This rule does not result in a taking of private property or 
otherwise have regulatory takings implications under Executive Order 
12630. The rule rescinds a regulatory provision suspended by a court 
since 1985; therefore, the rule will not result in private property 
being taken for public use without just compensation. A takings 
implication assessment is not required.

Executive Order 12866--Regulatory Planning and Review and Executive 
Order 13563--Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review

    Executive Order 12866 provides that the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
will review all significant rules. OIRA has determined that this rule 
is not significant.
    Executive Order 13563 reaffirms the principles of Executive Order 
12866, while calling for improvements in the Nation's regulatory system 
to promote predictability, reduce uncertainty, and use the best, most 
innovative, and least burdensome tools for achieving regulatory ends. 
Executive Order 13563 directs agencies to consider regulatory 
approaches that reduce burdens and maintain flexibility and freedom of 
choice for the public where these approaches are relevant, feasible, 
and consistent with regulatory objectives. Executive Order 13563 
emphasizes further that agencies must base regulations on the best 
available science and that the rulemaking process must allow for public 
participation and an open exchange of ideas. The Department developed 
this rule in a manner consistent with these requirements.

Executive Order 12988--Civil Justice Reform

    This direct final rule complies with the requirements of Executive 
Order 12988. Among other things, this rule:
    (a) Meets the criteria of section 3(a) requiring that all 
regulations be reviewed to eliminate errors and ambiguity and be 
written to minimize litigation;
    (b) Meets the criteria of section 3(b)(2) requiring that all 
regulations be written in clear language and contain clear legal 
standards.

Executive Order 13132--Federalism

    Under the criteria of section 1 of Executive Order 13132, this rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the 
preparation of a federalism summary impact statement. This rule will 
not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship 
between the national government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. A 
federalism

[[Page 54577]]

summary impact statement is not required.

Executive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments

    The Department of the Interior strives to strengthen its 
government-to-government relationship with Indian tribes through a 
commitment to consultation with Tribes and recognition of their right 
to self-governance and Tribal sovereignty. The Department evaluated 
this direct final rule under Executive Order 13175 and the Department's 
consultation policies and determined that it has no substantial direct 
effects on federally recognized Indian tribes and that consultation 
under the Department's Tribal consultation policies is not required. 
The rule merely revises the Federal regulations to remove language made 
obsolete by a 1985 court ruling.

Executive Order 13211--Actions Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use

    This direct final rule is not a significant energy action as 
defined in Executive Order 13211. Therefore, a Statement of Energy 
Effects is not required.

National Environmental Policy Act

    This direct final rule does not constitute a major Federal action 
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. A 
detailed statement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA, 
42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) is not required because this rule is covered by 
a categorical exclusion applicable to regulatory functions ``that are 
of an administrative, financial, legal, technical, or procedural 
nature.'' 43 CFR 46.210(i). In addition, the Department has determined 
that this rule does not involve any of the extraordinary circumstances 
listed in 43 CFR 46.215 that would require further analysis under NEPA.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    This rule does not impose any new information collection burden 
under the Paperwork Reduction Act. OMB previously approved the 
information collection activities contained in the existing regulations 
and assigned OMB control number 1029-0047. This rule does not impose an 
information collection burden because the Department is not making any 
changes to the information collection requirements.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA, 5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires an 
agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for all rules 
unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The RFA 
applies only to rules for which an agency is required to first publish 
a proposed rule. See 5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a). As the Department is 
not required to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking for this direct 
final rule, the RFA does not apply.

Congressional Review Act

    This rule is not a major rule under the Congressional Review Act (5 
U.S.C. 804(2)). Specifically, the direct final rule: (a) will not have 
an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (b) will not 
cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual 
industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic 
regions; and (c) will not have significant adverse effects on 
competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on 
the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-
based enterprises in domestic and export markets.

Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

    This rule does not impose an unfunded mandate on State, local, or 
Tribal governments, or the private sector, of more than $100 million 
per year. The rule does not have a significant or unique effect on 
State, local, or Tribal governments, or the private sector. The rule 
merely revises the Federal regulations to remove an obsolete provision 
that is no longer used. Therefore, a statement containing the 
information required by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1531 
et seq.) is not required.
