CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION

[Docket No. CPSC-2009-0044]


Agency Information Collection Activities; Extension of 
Collection; Safety Standard for Cigarette Lighters

AGENCY: Consumer Product Safety Commission.

ACTION: Notice of information collection; request for comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) announces that 
the Commission has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) a request for extension of approval of information collection 
requirements associated with the Safety Standard for Cigarette 
Lighters. OMB previously approved the collection of information under 
control number 3041-0116. OMB's most recent extension of approval will 
expire on November 30, 2025. On September 22, 2025, CPSC published a 
notice in the Federal Register to announce the agency's intention to 
seek extension of approval of the collection of information. The 
Commission received two, out of scope, public comments. Therefore, by 
publication of this notice, the Commission announces that CPSC has 
submitted to OMB a request for extension of approval of that collection 
of information.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: CPSC seeks to renew the following currently 
approved collection of information:
    Title: Safety Standard for Cigarette Lighters.
    OMB Number: 3041-0116.
    Type of Review: Renewal of collection.
    Frequency of Response: On occasion.
    Affected Public: Manufacturers and importers of cigarette lighters.
    General Description of Collection: The Safety Standard for 
Cigarette Lighters (16 CFR part 1210) addresses the risks of death and 
burn injury associated with fires accidentally started by children 
playing with cigarette lighters. The standard requires certain test 
protocols, as well as recordkeeping and reporting requirements. 16 CFR 
part 1210, subpart B. In addition, section 14(a) of the Consumer 
Product Safety Act (CPSA) requires manufacturers, importers, and 
private labelers of a consumer product subject to a consumer product 
safety standard to issue a certificate stating that the product 
complies with all applicable consumer product safety standards. 15 
U.S.C. 2063(a). Section 14(a) of the CPSA also requires that the 
certificate of compliance must be based on a test of each product or 
upon a reasonable testing program. Id.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: Based on averaging available data 
from fiscal years 2021 (used in the last PRA renewal) and 2024, CPSC 
estimates approximately 30 firms will respond to the collection 
annually.
    Estimated Time per Response: The burden associated with the 
standard includes the time spent compiling the test records. The burden 
associated with compiling a test record for a new model is expected to 
be about 90 hours per model. There is no burden associated with the 
comparison lighters.\1\ For recordkeeping, the time for a new model is 
estimated to be 20 hours and for a comparison lighter it is estimated 
to be three hours. For reporting, approximately one hour per product 
will be required for manufacturers to submit information to CPSC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Under Sec.  1210.14, if a manufacturer has tested one 
lighter model, and then wishes to distribute another lighter model 
that differs from the first model only in features that would not 
have an adverse effect on child resistance, the second model need 
not be tested in accordance with Sec.  1210.4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Total Estimated Annual Burden: CPSC expects four new models to be 
subject to initial qualification testing annually and approximately 139 
lighters comparable to previously tested models, comparison lighters, 
to be subject to ongoing testing annually.
    The burden associated with the standard includes the cost for 
compiling and maintaining the test records, either by the firm or by 
outside contractors. As previously mentioned, comparison lighters do 
not have a burden associated with compiling a test record, including 
costs. If the firm elects to use an outside contractor, the estimated 
cost for compiling a test record for a new model is about $25,000 on 
average.\2\ If all four new lighter models are tested annually by 
outside contractors, the cost is expected to be about $100,000. The 
total time to compile a test record for the four models, if conducted 
in-house, is approximately 360 hours. The total time for recordkeeping 
of new models is expected to be 80 hours (20 hours x 4 models). For 139 
comparison lighters, the estimated burden for recordkeeping is 417 
hours (139 models x 3 hours). For reporting, CPSC estimates 143 total 
hours for reporting (4 new models + 139 comparison lighters). The 
annual total number of hours is expected to be 1,000 hours (360 testing 
hours + 497 record keeping hours + 143 reporting hours) per year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ This estimate is based on an approximate cost of $22,000 of 
compiling a test record per panel, but for a few models a second 
test panel will be required.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Total Estimated Annual Cost to Respondents: CPSC estimates that 
hourly compensation for the time required for compiling a test record 
is $77.19 per hour (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, ``Employer Costs 
for Employee total compensation for management, professional, and 
related workers in goods-producing industries: <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_06132025.pdf">https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_06132025.pdf</a>). The total cost to industry 
for this regulation is expected to be within the range of $27,788 to 
$100,000 per year, depending on whether the testing is performed in-
house or outsourced.
    For the recordkeeping burden, CPSC estimates that the hourly 
compensation is $41.59 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, ``Employer 
Costs for Employee Compensation,'' March 2025, Table 4, total 
compensation for all sales and office workers in goods-producing, 
private industries: <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_06132025.pdf">https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_06132025.pdf</a>). The estimated annual cost of recordkeeping for new 
models rounded to the nearest dollar is $3,327 (80 hours x $41.59). The 
estimated annual cost of recordkeeping for comparison lighters rounded 
to the nearest dollar is $17,343 (417 hours x $41.59). In total, the 
estimated recordkeeping burden for new lighter models and comparison 
lighters is 497 hours (80 hours + 417 hours). The estimated total 
recordkeeping costs for new lighter models and comparison lighters is 
$20,670 ($3,327 + $17,343).
    For the reporting burden, CPSC estimates the hourly compensation 
for the time required for submitting the form to be $41.59 (U.S. Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, ``Employer Costs for Employee Compensation,'' 
March 2025, Table 4, total compensation for all sales and office 
workers in goods-producing, private industries: <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_06132025.pdf">https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_06132025.pdf</a>). Therefore, rounded to the 
nearest whole dollar, the estimated cost of reporting is $5,947.
    CPSC estimates that the total burden cost for firms to prepare, 
maintain, and submit testing records to the CPSC is within the range of 
$54,406 to $126,618, depending upon whether the firms choose to conduct 
testing in-house or through outsourcing.
