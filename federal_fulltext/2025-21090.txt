SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 
CFR part 39 by adding an AD that would apply to all Pilatus Model PC-24 
airplanes. The NPRM was published in the Federal Register on June 18, 
2025 (90 FR 25909). The NPRM was prompted by AD 2024-0240, dated 
December 10, 2024, issued by EASA, which is the Technical Agent for the 
Member States of the European Union (also referred to as the MCAI). The 
MCAI states there was a report of an inaccurate flight director 
calculation on approach with APEX Build 5.3 and below software 
installed. Further investigation revealed that heading splits can cause 
errors in the flight director calculation, resulting in lateral offsets 
to the desired approach course. The MCAI also states that the AD is 
considered an interim action and further AD action may follow.
    In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to require incorporating a temporary 
revision into the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) for the 
affected airplanes, which revises the Abnormal Procedures Section. The 
FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these 
products.
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2025-0917.

Discussion of Final Airworthiness Directive

Comments

    The FAA received no comments on the NPRM or on the determination of 
the costs.

Conclusion

    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority 
of another country and are approved for operation in the United States. 
Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design 
Authority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant 
data, considered any comments received, and determined that air safety 
requires adopting this AD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing 
this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. This AD is 
adopted as proposed in the NPRM.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2024-0240, which specifies procedures for 
incorporating Pilatus PC-24 AFM Temporary Revision 02371-075 (also 
referred to as AFM-TR) into the AFM, which revises the Abnormal 
Procedures Section. EASA AD 2024-0240 also specifies informing all 
flight crews of the change, and, thereafter, operating the airplane 
accordingly, and allows for the incorporation of a later AFM revision 
that includes the same AFM amendment content. This material is 
reasonably available because the interested parties have access to it 
through their normal course of business or by the means identified in 
the ADDRESSES section.

Differences Between This AD and the MCAI

    EASA AD 2024-0240 includes requirements to ``inform all flight 
crews and, thereafter, operate the [airplane] accordingly'', and this 
AD does not specifically require those actions because those actions 
are already required by existing FAA regulations (see 14 CFR 91.9, 
91.505, and 135.21).

Interim Action

    The FAA considers this AD an interim action. This unsafe condition 
is still under investigation by the manufacturer and, depending on the 
results of that investigation, the FAA may consider further rulemaking 
action.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 150 airplanes of U.S. 
registry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:

                                                 Estimated Costs

                                       hour = $85.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, 
on the relationship between the national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various 
levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
