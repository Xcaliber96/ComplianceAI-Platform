ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

40 CFR Parts 52 and 70

[EPA-R07-OAR-2025-2830; FRL-13059-01-R7]


Air Plan Approval; Missouri; Reporting Emission Data, Emission 
Fees, and Process Information

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

ACTION: Proposed rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing 
approval of revisions to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP), 
and Operating Permits Program related to Reporting Emission Data, 
Emission Fees, and Process Information. The revisions set emission fees 
and a base fee for calendar years 2025-2028 and beyond, add 1-
Bromopropane to the category 1 Hazardous Air Pollutant list in table 1, 
update two publication dates for material that is incorporated by 
reference and make minor administrative changes to the rule. These 
revisions do not impact the stringency of the SIP or have an adverse 
effect on air quality. The EPA's proposed approval of this rule 
revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean 
Air Act (CAA).

DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 29, 2025.

ADDRESSES: You may send comments, identified by Docket ID No. EPA-R07-

II. What is being addressed in this document?

    The EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the Missouri SIP and 
title V Operating Permits Program, 10-6.110 ``Reporting Emission Data, 
Emission Fees, and Process Information,'' submitted to the EPA on March 
19, 2025. The amendments to this rule set emission fees and a base fee 
for calendar years 2025-2028 and beyond, add 1-Bromopropane to the 
category 1 Hazardous Air Pollutant list in table 1, update two 
publication dates for material that is incorporated by reference, and 
make minor administrative changes to the rule. The EPA proposes to find 
that these revisions meet the requirements of the CAA, do not impact 
the stringency of the SIP, and do not adversely impact air quality. The 
full text of the rule revisions can be found in the State submittal 
included in this docket.

III. Have the requirements for approval of a SIP revision been met?

    The State submission has met the public notice requirements for SIP 
submissions in accordance with 40 CFR 51.102. The submission also 
satisfied the completeness criteria of 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The 
State provided public notice on this SIP revision and related 
amendments to their Title V Operating Permits Program, from July 15, 
2024, to September 5, 2024, and held a public hearing on August 29, 
2024. The state of Missouri received one supporting comment during the 
public comment period on 10 CSR 10-6.110. The revision meets the 
substantive SIP requirements of the CAA, including section 110 and 
implementing regulations and is consistent with applicable EPA 
requirements in title V of the CAA and 40 CFR part 70.

IV. What action is the EPA taking?

    The EPA is proposing to amend the Missouri SIP by approving the 
State's request to revise 10 CSR 10-6.110 ``Reporting Emission Data, 
Emission Fees, and Process Information.'' The EPA's proposed action 
approves these amendments as part of the SIP, except for subsection 
(3)(A), which is not included in the SIP. However, the entire rule 
revision is being submitted for inclusion in the Missouri Title V 
program. These revisions update the emissions fee for permitted sources 
in subsection (3)(A) and the emission reporting years in table 4 of 
section (4)(B), as set by Missouri statute. Specifically, section 
(3)(A) revises the emission fees section, which is approved under the 
Operating Permits

[[Page 54606]]

Program only and is not being proposed to be approved in the Missouri 
SIP. The revised emission fees section updates the emissions fee for 
permitted sources as set by Missouri statute per ton of air pollution 
emitted annually for calendar years 2025-2028 and beyond and is 
effective January 1, 2026.
    We are processing this as a proposed action because we are 
soliciting comments on this proposed action. Final rulemaking will 
occur after consideration of any comments.

V. Incorporation by Reference

    In this document, the EPA is proposing to include regulatory text 
in an EPA final rule that includes incorporation by reference. In 
accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, the EPA is proposing to 
finalize the incorporation by reference of the Missouri rule 10 CSR 10-
6.110 discussed in section II. of this preamble and as set forth below 
in the proposed amendments to 40 CFR part 52. The purpose of this state 
regulation is to provide procedures for reporting emission related 
information and establishing emission fees for the purpose of state air 
resource planning. The EPA has made, and will continue to make, these 
materials generally available through <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> and 
at the EPA Region 7 Office (please contact the person identified in the 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this preamble for more 
information).

VI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

    Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP 
submission that complies with the provisions of the CAA and applicable 
Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in 
reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve state choices, 
provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this 
action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and 
does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state 
law. For that reason, this action:
    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review 
by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 12866 (58 
FR 51735, October 4, 1993);
    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, 
February 6, 2025) because State Implementation Plan actions are exempt 
from review under Executive Order 12866;
    <bullet> Does not impose an information collection burden under the 
provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);
    <bullet> Is certified as not having a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
    <bullet> Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);
    <bullet> Does not have federalism implications as specified in 
Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);
    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, 
April 23, 1997) because it approves a state program;
    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to 
Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and
    <bullet> Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the 
National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 
note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent 
with the CAA.
    In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian 
reservation land or in any other area where EPA or an Indian Tribe has 
demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian 
country, the rule does not have Tribal implications and will not impose 
substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law as 
specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).
