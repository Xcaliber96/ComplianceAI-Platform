SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 
CFR part 39 by adding an AD that would apply to all The Boeing Company 
Model 717-200 airplanes. The NPRM was published in the Federal Register 
on April 29, 2025 (90 FR 17746). The NPRM was prompted by a report of a 
nose landing gear-up landing caused by the failure of the upper lock 
link assembly. In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to require repetitive 
inspections for cracking of the upper lock link assembly and applicable 
on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address a failure 
of the upper lock link assembly caused by non-conforming surface 
roughness, due to tool marks on the surface. The unsafe condition, if 
not addressed, could result in a failure of the nose landing gear (NLG) 
to fully extend during landing or cause the nose gear to remain 
retracted while the main gear deploys. Additionally, it could restrict 
ground

[[Page 54553]]

maneuverability, increasing the risk of a runway excursion.

Discussion of Final Airworthiness Directive

Comments

    The FAA received comments from the Air Line Pilots Association, 
International (ALPA) and Boeing who supported the NPRM without change.
    The FAA received additional comments from Delta Air Lines (Delta) 
and an anonymous commenter. The following presents those comments and 
the FAA's response.

Request To Exclude Newly Manufactured Parts

    Delta requested that the FAA add an exception to paragraph (h) of 
the proposed AD to exclude from the overhaul requirement upper lock 
link assemblies manufactured after a specific date. Delta stated that 
Boeing Alert Requirements Bulletin 717-32A0043 RB, dated February 12, 
2025, specifies overhauling all upper lock link assemblies, including 
newly manufactured parts. Delta claimed that overhaul of new parts 
places a significant burden on operators, particularly those relying on 
third-party vendors for overhaul services. Delta also expressed concern 
that this action implies newly manufactured parts are still being 
manufactured and delivered with the known defect. However, if the part 
defect has been addressed in production, Delta stated new parts 
produced after a specific date determined by the manufacturer should be 
exempted from the overhaul requirement.
    The FAA acknowledges the request. After consultation with the parts 
manufacturer, the FAA has determined that upper lock link assemblies 
manufactured after December 31, 2001, are serviceable upper lock link 
assemblies and therefore should be exempt from the overhaul 
requirement. Accordingly, the FAA has added paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) 
of this AD to exclude airplanes with an upper lock link assembly 
manufactured after December 31, 2001, from the requirements of this AD.

Request To Expand the Definition of Serviceable Upper Lock Link 
Assembly

    Delta requested that the FAA add an exception to paragraph (h) of 
the proposed AD to expand the definition of a serviceable upper lock 
link assembly to include parts that were manufactured after a specific 
date determined by the manufacturer. As discussed in the previous 
comment, Delta stated that the part defect may have been addressed in 
production, and these new parts should be included in the definition of 
a serviceable upper lock link assembly. Delta stated that note (a) of 
table 1 defines a serviceable part solely as one that has been 
overhauled in accordance with a certain overhaul manual.
    The FAA agrees with the request for the reasons provided in the 
previous comment. Accordingly, the FAA has added paragraph (h)(4) to 
include upper lock link assemblies manufactured after December 31, 
2001, in the definition of a serviceable upper lock link assembly.

Request To Allow Installation of a Non-Overhauled Part

    Delta noted that table 1, condition 1 of Boeing Alert Requirements 
Bulletin 717-32A0043 RB, dated February 12, 2025, specifies installing 
a serviceable upper lock link assembly (i.e., one that has been 
overhauled in accordance with a certain overhaul manual) before further 
flight if any crack is found as a result of the eddy current high 
frequency (ETHF) inspection. Delta requested the FAA add an exception 
to paragraph (h) of the proposed AD to provide an option to table 1, 
condition 1 (in case a crack is found) that instead allows installation 
of an upper lock link assembly that has not been overhauled in 
accordance with a certain overhaul manual but has complied with the 
initial ETHF inspection. Delta suggested that an upper lock link 
assembly that has been inspected by the ETHF inspection should be 
considered acceptable for installation because it is being tracked to 
comply with the repetitive inspection interval every 4,800 flight 
cycles. Delta asserted that this approach would maintain an equivalent 
level of safety while offering operators greater flexibility.
    The FAA infers that Delta is requesting that the FAA revise the AD 
to allow installation of an upper lock link assembly that has not been 
overhauled in accordance with the overhaul manual referenced in the 
requirements bulletin but on which the ETHF inspection has been 
accomplished with no crack found. The FAA agrees with this request. The 
FAA has determined that, in this case, the affected upper lock link 
assembly is being tracked and maintained in accordance with the 
required repetitive ETHF inspection interval, and that this approach 
maintains an equivalent level of safety. The FAA has not changed the AD 
in this regard because installation of a non-overhauled part is already 
acceptable under table 1, condition 2, option 1 of the requirements 
bulletin.

Request To Reduce the Repetitive Inspection Interval

    An anonymous commenter requested that the FAA revise the proposed 
AD to require more frequent inspections, especially for aircraft with 
high cycle counts. The commenter asserted that the proposed inspection 
requirements do not address the serious safety risk of the nose gear-up 
landing incident that prompted the proposed AD.
    The FAA disagrees with reducing the repetitive inspection interval. 
The safety concern of this AD is not related to the number of airplane 
cycles. The root cause of the upper lock link assembly failure was non-
conforming surface roughness from tool marks. The referenced service 
information in this AD outlines procedures for repetitive ETHF 
inspections of both the top and bottom surfaces of the upper lock link 
assembly to detect any cracks and specifies replacement of any cracked 
assemblies with serviceable ones. The repetitive inspection interval of 
4,800 cycles was calculated by crack growth analysis and was correlated 
to the striation count data in the National Transportation Safety Board 
(NTSB) lab report. The required inspection interval allows for two 
inspection opportunities between crack detectability and instability. 
The FAA did not change this AD in response to this comment.

Request To Require Immediate Replacement of the Affected Parts

    An anonymous commenter requested that the FAA revise the proposed 
AD to require immediate replacement of all upper lock link assemblies 
manufactured during the same production period as the failed part 
identified in the related NTSB report, rather than waiting for cracks 
to become visible during routine inspections.
    The FAA disagrees with the request. As discussed in its response to 
the previous comment, the FAA has determined that accomplishing the 
repetitive inspections within the required inspection interval provides 
an acceptable level of safety. Replacement of the upper lock link 
assemblies with a serviceable upper lock link assembly terminates the 
repetitive inspections. The FAA notes that a serviceable upper lock 
link assembly is defined in Boeing Alert Requirements Bulletin 717-
32A0043 RB, dated February 12, 2025, except as specified in paragraph 
(h)(4) of this AD. The FAA has not changed the AD in this regard.

Conclusion

    The FAA reviewed the relevant data, considered the comments 
received, and

[[Page 54554]]

determined that air safety requires adopting this AD as proposed. 
Accordingly, the FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition 
on these products. Except for minor editorial changes, and any other 
changes described previously, this AD is adopted as proposed in the 
NPRM. None of the changes will increase the economic burden on any 
operator.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed Boeing Alert Requirements Bulletin 717-32A0043 RB, 
dated February 12, 2025. This material specifies procedures for 
repetitive ETHF inspections of the top and bottom surfaces of the upper 
lock link assembly for any crack, and replacement of any cracked upper 
lock link assembly with a serviceable upper lock link assembly. This 
material also specifies that replacement of the upper lock link 
assembly terminates the repetitive inspections.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 117 airplanes of U.S. 
registry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:

                                                 Estimated Costs

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, 
on the relationship between the national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various 
levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
