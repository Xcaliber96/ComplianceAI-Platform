send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this 
collection of information, including the necessity and utility of the 
proposed information collection for the proper performance of the 
agency's functions, the accuracy of the estimated burden, ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be 
collected, and the use of automated collection techniques or other 
forms of information technology to minimize the information collection 
burden.

the OMB desk officer by December 29, 2025.

ADDRESSES: Written comments and recommendations for the proposed 
information collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), federal agencies must obtain approval from 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for each collection of 
information they conduct or sponsor. The term ``collection of 
information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and 
includes agency requests or requirements that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a third party. 
Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)) requires 
federal agencies to publish a 30-day notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed collection of information, including each 
proposed extension or reinstatement of an existing collection of 
information, before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, CMS is publishing this notice that 
summarizes the following proposed collection(s) of information for 
public comment.
    1. Type of Information Collection Request: Extension of a currently 
approved collection; Title of Information Collection: Medicaid Program; 
Eligibility Changes under the Affordable Care Act of 2010; Use: The 
State Medicaid and CHIP agencies will collect all information needed to 
determine and redetermine eligibility for Medicaid and will transmit 
information, as appropriate, to other insurance affordability programs. 
The information collection requirements will assist the public to 
understand information about health insurance affordability programs 
and will assist CMS in ensuring the seamless, coordinated, and 
simplified system of Medicaid and CHIP application, eligibility 
determination, verification, enrollment, and renewal. Form Number: CMS-
10410 (OMB control number: 0938-1147); Frequency: Occasionally; 
Affected Public: Individuals or households, and State, Local, and 
Tribal Governments; Number of Respondents: 25,500,096; Total Annual 
Responses: 76,500,218; Total Annual Hours: 21,266,302. (For policy 
questions regarding this collection contact: Abby Kahn at 410-786-
4321.)
    2. Type of Information Collection Request: Revision of a currently 
approved collection; Title of Information Collection: Solicitation for 
Applications for Medicare Prescription Drug Plan 2027 Contracts; Use: 
Coverage for the prescription drug benefit is provided through 
contracted prescription drug plans (PDPs) or through Medicare Advantage 
(MA) plans that offer integrated prescription drug and health care 
coverage (MA-PD plans). Cost Plans that are regulated under Section 
1876 of the Social Security Act, and Employer Group Waiver Plans (EGWP) 
may also provide a Part D benefit. Organizations wishing to provide 
services under the Prescription Drug Benefit Program must complete an 
application, negotiate rates, and receive final approval from CMS. 
Existing Part D Sponsors may also expand their contracted service area 
by completing the Service Area Expansion (SAE) application.
    Collection of this information is mandated in Part D of the 
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 
(MMA) in Subpart 3. The application requirements are codified in 
Subpart K of 42 CFR 423 entitled ``Application Procedures and Contracts 
with PDP Sponsors.''
    The information will be collected under the solicitation of 
proposals from PDP, MA-PD, Cost Plan, Program of All-Inclusive Care for 
the Elderly (PACE), and EGWP applicants. The collected information will 
be used by CMS to: (1) ensure that applicants meet CMS requirements for 
offering Part D plans (including network adequacy, contracting 
requirements, and compliance program requirements, as described in the 
application), (2) support the determination of contract awards. Form 
Number: CMS-10137 (OMB control number: 0938-0936); Frequency: Yearly; 
Affected Public: Private Sector, Business or other for profits, Not for 
profits institutions; Number of Respondents: 785; Total Annual 
Responses: 402; Total Annual Hours: 1,723. (For policy questions 
regarding this collection contact April Forsythe at 410-786-8493 or
