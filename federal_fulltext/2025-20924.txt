Amendment 39-23162; AD 2025-20-09]
RIN 2120-AA64


Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Final rule; request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-22-
09, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-1041 airplanes. AD 
2022-22-09 required replacing affected hydro-mechanical units (HMUs) 
with serviceable HMUs before reaching a reduced life limit and limited 
the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. Since the 
FAA issued AD 2022-22-09, an improved HMU was developed and embodied in 
production. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-22-09. 
This AD also requires replacing affected HMUs with improved HMUs and 
prohibits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions 
and on certain airplanes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the 
unsafe condition on these products.

commentary that the FAA receives which is not specifically designated 
as CBI will be placed in the public docket for this rulemaking.

[[Page 53204]]

Background

    The FAA issued AD 2022-22-09, Amendment 39-22224 (87 FR 72377, 
November 25, 2022) (AD 2022-22-09), for Airbus SAS Model A350-1041 
airplanes equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines. AD 2022-22-09 
was prompted by an MCAI originated by EASA, which is the Technical 
Agent for the Member States of the European Union. EASA issued AD 2022-
0040, dated March 8, 2022 (EASA AD 2022-0040), to correct an unsafe 
condition. AD 2022-22-09 was prompted by reports of rejected takeoffs 
after transient engine N1 shaft speed exceedance, which was found to be 
the result of piston wear, causing the combining spill valve (CSV) 
piston of the engine HMU to close slowly. EASA AD 2022-0040 stated 
investigations revealed that the CSV of the engine HMU was slow to 
close due to piston wear. A worn CSV piston does not move fully and 
freely over its operating range, and, when it moves to fully closed 
position, an excess of fuel is sent to the fuel nozzles which 
eventually results in an N1 transient shaft overspeed.
    AD 2022-22-09 required replacing certain HMUs with serviceable HMUs 
before reaching a reduced life limit. The FAA issued AD 2022-22-09 to 
address a stuck CSV piston of the engine HMUs, which could 
significantly reduce engine thrust, and if combined with a loss of the 
second engine, could possibly result in reduced control of the 
airplane.

Actions Since AD 2022-22-09 Was Issued

    The preamble to AD 2022-22-09 specifies that the FAA considers that 
AD ``interim action'' and that the FAA might consider further 
rulemaking if a final action is identified. Since the FAA issued AD 
2022-22-09, EASA superseded AD 2022-0040 with EASA AD 2025-0100, dated 
April 30, 2025 (EASA AD 2025-0100) (also referred to as the MCAI), to 
correct an unsafe condition for Airbus SAS Model A350-1041 airplanes 
equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines. The MCAI states, since 
issuance of EASA AD 2022-0040, an improved HMU has been developed and 
embodied in production through Airbus modification 120423. In addition, 
Rolls-Royce published Rolls-Royce Modification Service Bulletin TRENT 
XWB 73-L044 to provide instructions for replacement of an affected HMU 
with an improved HMU, as a terminating action for replacement of the 
life-limited affected parts. The FAA has now determined that further 
rulemaking is necessary, and this AD follows from that determination.
    The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these 
products. You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> 
under Docket No. FAA-2025-3423.

Explanation of Retained Requirements

    Although this AD does not explicitly restate the requirements of AD 
2022-22-09, this AD retains all of the requirements of AD 2022-22-09. 
Those requirements are referenced in EASA AD 2025-0100, which, in turn, 
is referenced in paragraph (g) of this AD.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2025-0100, which specifies procedures for 
replacing an HMU having part number (P/N) G5020HMU02 with either a 
serviceable HMU, or an improved HMU having P/N G5020HMU03, or any later 
approved part number. EASA AD 2025-0100 also prohibits the installation 
of an affected HMU after it is replaced with an improved HMU.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

FAA's Determination

    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority 
of another country and are approved for operation in the United States. 
Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design 
Authority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA is issuing this AD 
after determining that the unsafe condition described previously is 
likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design.

Requirements of This AD

    This AD retains all requirements of AD 2022-22-09. This AD requires 
accomplishing the actions specified in EASA AD 2025-0100 described 
previously, except for any differences identified as exceptions in the 
regulatory text of this AD. This AD also prohibits the installation of 
affected parts under certain conditions.

Explanation of Required Compliance Information

    In the FAA's ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of the AD 
process, the FAA developed a process to use some civil aviation 
authority (CAA) ADs as the primary source of information for compliance 
with requirements for corresponding FAA ADs. The FAA has been 
coordinating this process with manufacturers and CAAs. As a result, 
EASA AD 2025-0100 is incorporated by reference in this AD. This AD 
requires compliance with EASA AD 2025-0100 in its entirety through that 
incorporation, except for any differences identified as exceptions in 
the regulatory text of this AD. Using common terms that are the same as 
the heading of a particular section in EASA AD 2025-0100 does not mean 
that operators need comply only with that section. For example, where 
the AD requirement refers to ``all required actions and compliance 
times,'' compliance with this AD requirement is not limited to the 
section titled ``Required Action(s) and Compliance Time(s)'' in EASA AD 
2025-0100. Material required by EASA AD 2025-0100 for compliance will 
be available at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under Docket No. FAA-2025-3423 after 
this AD is published.

Justification for Immediate Adoption and Determination of the Effective 
Date

    Section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 
551 et seq.) authorizes agencies to dispense with notice and comment 
procedures for rules when the agency, for ``good cause,'' finds that 
those procedures are ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
public interest.'' Under this section, an agency, upon finding good 
cause, may issue a final rule without providing notice and seeking 
comment prior to issuance. Further, section 553(d) of the APA 
authorizes agencies to make rules effective in less than thirty days, 
upon a finding of good cause.
    There are currently no domestic operators of these products. 
Accordingly, notice and opportunity for prior public comment are 
unnecessary, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b). In addition, for the 
foregoing reason(s), the FAA finds that good cause exists pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 553(d) for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.

Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)

    The requirements of the RFA do not apply when an agency finds good 
cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 to adopt a rule without prior notice and 
comment. Because the FAA has determined that it has good cause to adopt 
this rule without notice and comment, RFA analysis is not required.

Costs of Compliance

    Currently, there are no affected U.S.-registered airplanes. If an 
affected airplane is imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the 
future, the FAA

[[Page 53205]]

provides the following cost estimates to comply with this AD:

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, 
on the relationship between the national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various 
levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866, and
    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska.
