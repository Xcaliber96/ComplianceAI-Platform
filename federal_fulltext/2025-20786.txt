SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: FERC-920 Electric Quarterly Reports (EQR).
    OMB Control No.: 1902-0255.
    Type of Respondent: Public utilities, and non-public utilities with 
more than a de minimis market presence.
    Type of Request: Three-year extension of the FERC-920 information 
collection with no changes to the current reporting requirements.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ This Notice is separate from, and does not address, the 
activities in Docket No. RM23-9-000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Abstract: The Commission originally set forth the EQR filing 
requirements in Order No. 2001 (Docket No. RM01-8-000) which required 
public utilities to electronically file EQRs summarizing transaction 
information for short-term and long-term cost-based sales and market-
based rate sales and the contractual terms and conditions in their 
agreements or all jurisdictional services.\2\ The Commission 
established the EQR reporting requirements to help ensure the 
collection of information needed to perform its regulatory functions 
over transmission and sales of electric power, while making data 
available to the public and allowing public utilities to better fulfill 
their responsibility under Federal Power Act (FPA) section 205(c) \3\ 
to have rates on file in a convenient form and place. As noted in Order 
No. 2001, the EQR data is designed to ``provide greater price 
transparency, promote competition, enhance confidence in the fairness 
of the markets, and provide a better means to detect and discourage 
discriminatory practices.'' \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Moreover, collecting data in the EQR is consistent with the Ninth 
Circuit Court of Appeals' decisions upholding the Commission's market-
based rate program on the basis of the ``dual requirement of an ex ante 
finding of the absence of market power and sufficient post-approval 
reporting requirements.'' \5\ Specifically, the court upheld the 
Commission's market-based rate program because it relies on a ``system 
[that] consists of a finding that the applicant lacks market power (or 
has taken steps to mitigate market power), coupled with strict 
reporting to ensure that the rate is `just and reasonable' and that 
markets are not subject to manipulation.'' \6\

Cir. 2004) (Lockyer) (emphasis in original). See also Mont. Consumer 
Counsel v. FERC, 659 F.3d 910, 920 (9th Cir. 2011).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Since issuing Order No. 2001, the Commission has provided guidance 
and refined the reporting requirements, as necessary, to reflect 
changes in the Commission's rules and regulations.\7\ The Commission 
also adopted an EQR Data Dictionary, which provides in one document the 
definitions of certain terms and values used in filing EQR data.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See, e.g., Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements for 
Electric Quarterly Reports, 124 FERC ] 61,244 (2008) (providing 
guidance on the filing of information on transmission capacity 
reassignments in EQRs).
    \8\ Order No. 2001-G, 120 FERC ] 61,270 (2007).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To increase transparency broadly across all wholesale markets 
subject to the Commission's jurisdiction, the Commission issued Order 
No. 768 in 2012.\9\ Order No. 768 required market participants that are 
excluded from the Commission's jurisdiction under FPA section 205 (non-
public utilities) and have more than a de minimis market presence to 
file EQRs with the Commission. In addition, Order No. 768 revised the 
EQR filing requirements to build upon the Commission's prior 
improvements to the reporting requirements and further enhance the 
goals of providing greater price transparency, promoting competition, 
instilling confidence in the fairness of the markets, and providing a 
better means to detect and discourage anti-competitive, discriminatory, 
and manipulative practices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ Order No. 768, 77 FR 61896 (Oct. 11, 2012), FERC Stats. & 
Regs. ] 31,336 (2012).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    EQR information allows the public to assess market fundamentals and 
to price interstate wholesale market transactions. This, in turn, 
results in greater market confidence, lower transaction costs, and 
ultimately supports competitive markets. In addition, the data filed in 
the EQR strengthens the Commission's ability to exercise its wholesale 
electric rate and electric power transmission oversight and enforcement 
responsibilities in accordance with the FPA. Without this information, 
the Commission would lack some of the data it needs to support its 
regulatory function over transmission and sales of electric power.
    Type of Respondent: Public utilities, and non-public utilities with 
more than a de minimis market presence.
    Estimate of Annual Burden and Cost: \10\ The Commission estimates 
the annual public reporting burden \11\ for the information collection 
as:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ The cost is based on FERC's 2025 Commission-wide average 
salary cost (salary plus benefits) of $103/hour. The Commission 
staff believes the FERC FTE (full-time equivalent) average cost for 
wages plus benefits is representative of the corresponding cost for 
the industry respondents.
    \11\ Burden is defined as the total time, effort, or financial 
resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, or 
disclose or provide information to or for a federal agency. For 
further explanation of what is included in the information 
collection burden, refer to 5 Code of Federal Regulations 1320.3.
