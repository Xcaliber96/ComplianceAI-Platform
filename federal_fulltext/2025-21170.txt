SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    In accordance with OMB Memorandum M-25-32, the DoD has conducted a 
review of its Privacy Act SORNs to ensure alignment with E.O. 14249 and 
Federal efforts to reduce improper payments and strengthen program 
integrity. As a result of this review, the agency has identified 18 
SORNs requiring modification to support disclosures to the Department 
of Treasury's Do Not Pay Working System. The change involves adding a 
new routine use to each of the identified SORNs. This routine use will 
authorize

[[Page 54313]]

the disclosure of information relevant to verifying payment and award 
eligibility through the Do Not Pay Working System. The purpose of this 
modification notice is to enhance the agency's ability to prevent 
improper payments, comply with government-wide financial integrity 
mandates, and improve operational efficiency in determining eligibility 
for Federal funds. This modification notice does not alter the 
categories of individuals or records maintained in the systems, nor 
does it change the authority or method of collection. Instead, it 
strengthens the agency's data sharing posture in support of 
transparency and accountability.
    DoD SORNs are published in the Federal Register and are available 
from the address in FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT or at the Privacy 
and Civil Liberties Division website at <a href="https://dpcld.defense.gov">https://dpcld.defense.gov</a>.

II. Privacy Act

    Under the Privacy Act, a ``system of records'' is a group of 
records under the control of an agency from which information is 
retrieved by the name of an individual or by some identifying number, 
symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual. In 
the Privacy Act, an individual is defined as a U.S. citizen or alien 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
    In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) and Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-108, DoD has provided a report of this 
consolidated notice to OMB and Congress.

    Dated: November 21, 2025.
