14 CFR Part 39

[Docket No. FAA-2025-5037; Project Identifier AD-2025-00212-A]
RIN 2120-AA64


Airworthiness Directives; Textron Aviation, Inc. (Type 
Certificate Previously Held by Cessna Aircraft Company) Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) 
for all Textron Aviation, Inc., Model 525B airplanes. This proposed AD 
was prompted by the manufacturer's revision of the aircraft maintenance 
manual (AMM) to introduce more restrictive inspection intervals. This 
proposed AD would require revising the Airworthiness Limitations 
Section (ALS) of the existing AMM or instructions for continued 
airworthiness (ICA) and the existing approved maintenance or inspection 
program, as applicable. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the 
unsafe condition on these products.

DATES: The FAA must receive comments on this proposed AD by January 12, 
2026.

ADDRESSES: You may send comments, using the procedures found in 14 CFR 
11.43 and 11.45, by any of the following methods:
    <bullet> Federal eRulemaking Portal: Go to <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a>. Follow 
the instructions for submitting comments.
    <bullet> Fax: (202) 493-2251.
    <bullet> Mail: U.S. Department of Transportation, Docket 
Operations, M-30, West Building Ground Floor, Room W12-140, 1200 New 
Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20590.
    <bullet> Hand Delivery: Deliver to Mail address above between 9 
a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    AD Docket: You may examine the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2025-5037; or in person at Docket Operations between 9 
a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The AD 
docket contains this NPRM, any comments received, and other 
information. The street address for Docket Operations is listed above.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Comments Invited

    The FAA invites you to send any written relevant data, views, or 
arguments about this proposal. Send your comments using a method listed 
under the ADDRESSES section. Include ``Docket No. FAA-2025-5037; 
Project Identifier AD-2025-00212-A'' at the beginning of your comments. 
The most helpful comments reference a specific portion of the proposal, 
explain the reason for any recommended change, and include supporting 
data. The FAA will consider all comments received by the closing date 
and may revise this proposal because of those comments.
    Except for Confidential Business Information (CBI) as described in 
the following paragraph, and other information as described in 14 CFR 
11.35, the FAA will post all comments received, without change, to 
<a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a>, including any personal information you provide. The 
agency will also post a report summarizing each substantive verbal 
contact received about this NPRM.

Confidential Business Information

    CBI is commercial or financial information that is both customarily 
and actually treated as private by its owner. Under the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), CBI is exempt from public 
disclosure. If your comments responsive to this NPRM contain commercial 
or financial information that is customarily treated as private, that 
you actually treat as private, and that is relevant or responsive to 
this NPRM, it is important that you clearly designate the submitted 
comments as CBI. Please mark each page of your submission containing 
CBI as ``PROPIN.'' The FAA will treat such marked submissions as 
confidential under the FOIA, and they will not be placed in the public 
docket of this NPRM. Submissions containing CBI should be sent to Soban 
Saeed, Aviation Safety Engineer, FAA, 1801 South Airport Road, Wichita, 
KS 67209. Any commentary that the FAA receives which is not 
specifically designated as CBI will be placed in the public docket for 
this rulemaking.

Background

    The FAA was notified by Textron Aviation that the existing Model 
525B AMM contained incorrect inspection intervals for airworthiness 
limitation tasks for Chapter 54--Nacelle/Pylons and Chapter 55--
Stabilizers. The incorrect inspection intervals were introduced during 
a technical manual update. The FAA is issuing this AD to prevent 
undetected cracks in the engine mount and vertical stabilizer front and 
rear spar caps. The unsafe conditions, if not addressed, could result 
in reduced structural integrity and consequent reduced controllability 
of the airplane.

FAA's Determination

    The FAA is issuing this NPRM after determining that the unsafe 
condition described previously is likely to exist or develop on other 
products of the same type design.

Proposed AD Requirements in This NPRM

    This proposed AD would require revising the ALS of the existing AMM 
or ICA and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as 
applicable, by incorporating the actions and associated thresholds and 
intervals specified in table 1 to paragraph (g) of this proposed AD.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD, if adopted as proposed, would 
affect 601 airplanes of U.S. registry.
    The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this proposed 
AD:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship 
between the national government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed 
regulation:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

reference, Safety.

The Proposed Amendment

    Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the 
Administrator, the FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 as follows:

    Textron Aviation Inc.: Docket No. FAA-2025-5037; Project 
Identifier AD-2025-00212-A.

(a) Comments Due Date

    The FAA must receive comments on this airworthiness directive 
(AD) by January 12, 2026.

and rear spar caps. The unsafe conditions, if not addressed, could 
result in reduced structural integrity and consequent reduced 
controllability of the airplane.
