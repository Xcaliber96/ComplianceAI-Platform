SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: OSHA's Alliance Program is a structure for 
working with groups that are committed to worker safety and health. The 
program enables OSHA to enter into a voluntary cooperative relationship 
with industry, labor and other groups to improve workplace safety and 
health, prevent workplace fatalities, injuries and illnesses, and to 
reach employers and workers that OSHA may not otherwise reach through 
traditional methods. OSHA collects information from organizations that 
are signatories to an Alliance agreement through meetings, informal 
conversations and data forms. OSHA will use the collected information 
to develop Alliance agreements, support Alliance activities and 
Alliance agreement objectives, and develop annual and program-wide 
reports. For additional substantive information about this ICR, see the 
related notice published in the Federal Register on July 11, 2025 (90 
FR 30989).
    Comments are invited on: (1) whether the collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Department, including whether the information will have practical 
utility; (2) the accuracy of the agency's estimates of the burden and 
cost of the collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility and clarity of the information collection; and (4) ways to 
minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are 
to respond, including the use of automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology.
    This information collection is subject to the PRA. A Federal agency 
generally cannot conduct or sponsor a collection of information, and 
the public is generally not required to respond to an information 
collection, unless the OMB approves it and displays a currently valid 
OMB Control Number. In addition, notwithstanding any other provisions 
of law, no person shall generally be subject to penalty for failing to 
comply with a collection of information that does not display a valid 
OMB Control Number. See 5 CFR 1320.5(a) and 1320.6.
    DOL seeks PRA authorization for this information collection for 
three (3) years. OMB authorization for an ICR cannot be for more than 
three (3) years without renewal. The DOL notes that information 
collection requirements submitted to the OMB for existing ICRs receive 
a month-to-month extension while they undergo review.
