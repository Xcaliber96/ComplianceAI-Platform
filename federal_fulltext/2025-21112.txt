Food and Nutrition Service

    Title: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program--Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance for Victims of Disasters.
    OMB Control Number: 0584-0336.
    Summary of Collection: The authority to operate the Disaster 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) is found in section 
5(h) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, formerly the Food Stamp Act 
of 1977, as amended and the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, as amended by 
the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Assistance Act of 1988 
authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish temporary 
emergency standards of eligibility for victims of a disaster if the 
commercial channels of food distribution have been disrupted, and 
subsequently restored. D-SNAP is a program that is separate from the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and is conducted for a 
specific period of time. In order for a State to request to operate a 
D-SNAP, an affected area in the State must have received a Presidential 
Declaration of ``Major Disaster'' with Individual Assistance.
    Need and Use of the Information: This information collection 
concerns information obtained from State agencies seeking to operate D-
SNAP. A State agency request to operate a D-SNAP must contain the 
following information: Description of incident; geographic area; 
application period; benefit period; eligibility criteria; ongoing 
household eligibility; affected population; electronic benefit card 
issuance process; logistical plans for Disaster SNAP rollout; staffing; 
public information outreach; duplicate participation check process; 
fraud prevention strategies; and employee application procedures. The 
Food and Nutrition Service reviews the request to ensure that all the 
necessary requirements to conduct a D-SNAP are met. If this collection 
is not conducted, D-SNAP would not be available to help meet the 
nutritional needs of disaster victims.
    Description of Respondents: State, Local, or Tribal Government.
    Number of Respondents: 9.
    Frequency of Responses: Reporting: On Occasion.
    Total Burden Hours: 888.
