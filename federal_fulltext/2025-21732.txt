SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    Pursuant to section 111.96 of title 19 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) (19 CFR 111.96(c)), U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) assesses an annual user fee for each customs broker 
permit granted to an individual, partnership, association, or 
corporation. The CBP regulations provide that this fee is payable each 
calendar year for a national permit held by a customs broker and must 
be paid by the due date published annually in the Federal Register. See 
19 CFR 24.22(h) and (i); 19 CFR 111.96(c).
    Section 24.22 of title 19 of the CFR (19 CFR 24.22) sets forth the 
terms and conditions for when fees for certain services, including 
specific customs user fees, are required. The specific customs user fee 
amounts that appear in 19 CFR 24.22 are not the actual fees but 
represent the base year amounts that are subject to adjustment each 
fiscal year in accordance with the Fixing America's Surface 
Transportation Act (FAST Act) (Pub. L. 114-94, December 4, 2015). 
Section 32201 of the FAST Act amended section 13031 of the Consolidated 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985 (19 U.S.C. 58c) by 
requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to adjust certain customs COBRA 
user fees and corresponding limitations to reflect certain increases in 
inflation. Paragraph (k) of section 24.22 of title 19 of the CFR (19 
CFR 24.22(k)) sets forth the methodology to adjust fees for inflation 
and to determine the change in inflation, including the factor by which 
the fees and limitations will be adjusted, if necessary.
    Customs brokers are subject to an annual customs broker permit user 
fee calculated using the base year amount in Appendix A to 19 CFR part 
24, as adjusted by the terms in 19 CFR 24.22(k). See 19 U.S.C. 
58c(a)(7) and 19 CFR 24.22(h). In accordance with 19 CFR 24.22, CBP 
determines annually whether an adjustment to the fees and limitations 
is necessary and publishes a Federal Register notice specifying the 
amount of the fees and limitations for each fiscal year. On July 23, 
2025, CBP published a Federal Register notice, entitled Customs User 
Fees To Be Adjusted for Inflation in Fiscal Year 2026 (CBP Decision 25-
10), which announced, among other fee adjustments, that the annual 
customs broker permit user fee will increase to $185.38 for calendar 
year 2026. See 90 FR 34665.
    Thus, as required by 19 CFR 24.22, CBP provided notice in the 
Federal Register of the annual fee amount at least 60 days prior to the 
date that the payment is due for each customs broker national permit. 
This document notifies customs brokers that, for calendar year 2026, 
the due date for payment of the annual customs broker permit user fee 
is January 30, 2026. If a customs broker fails to pay the annual 
customs broker permit user fee by January 30, 2026, the national permit 
is revoked by operation of law. See 19 CFR 111.45(b) and 111.96(c).
    Customs brokers may either submit the fee through the eCBP portal 
or submit the fee at the processing Center, as defined in 19 CFR 111.1, 
in accordance with the remittance

procedures in 19 CFR 24.22(i). CBP encourages customs brokers to pay 
the annual customs broker permit user fee electronically via the eCBP 
portal, located at <a href="https://e.cbp.dhs.gov/brokers/#/home">https://e.cbp.dhs.gov/brokers/#/home</a>. Customs 
brokers who are first time users of the eCBP portal must create a 
<a href="http://Login.gov">Login.gov</a> account. Instructions and training resources, such as user 
and quick reference guides, for customs brokers on how to create a 
<a href="http://Login.gov">Login.gov</a> account and how to use the eCBP portal can be found on CBP's 
website at <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/eCBP">https://www.cbp.gov/trade/eCBP</a>.
