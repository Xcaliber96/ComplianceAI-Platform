INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION


Notice Concerning the Appointment of the Commission's 
Administrative Law Judges for Section 337 Investigations

AGENCY: U.S. International Trade Commission.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade 
Commission's administrative law judges (``ALJs'') have been appointed 
in conformance with the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution 
and with the Tariff Act.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mercedeh Momeni, Office of the General 
Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW, 
Washington, DC 20436, telephone (202) 205-3152. General information 
concerning the Commission may also be obtained by accessing its 
internet server at <a href="http://www.usitc.gov">http://www.usitc.gov</a>. Hearing-impaired persons are 
advised that information on this matter can be obtained by contacting 
the Commission TDD terminal on (202) 205-1810.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 1337), provides for certain determinations to be 
``made on the record after notice and opportunity for a hearing in 
conformity with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 
5.'' 19 U.S.C. 1337(c). Pursuant to subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 
5, the Commission employs ALJs to conduct formal adjudications and to 
make initial and recommended determinations. 5 U.S.C. 556-557; 19 CFR 
210.3 (``administrative law judge''). Pursuant to section 331 of the 
Tariff Act, 19 U.S.C. 1331, the Chairman of the Commission has the 
authority to ``appoint and fix the compensation of such employees of 
the Commission as he deems necessary,'' including ALJs. 19 U.S.C. 
1331(a)(1)(A)(1). Any such decision by the Chairman, however, is 
``subject to disapproval by a majority vote of all the commissioners in 
office.'' 19 U.S.C. 1331(a)(1)(C).
    The Appointments Clause of the Constitution, art. II, Sec.  2, cl. 
2, provides, in relevant part, that Congress may vest the appointment 
of inferior officers ``in the Heads of Departments.'' In 2018, the 
Supreme Court decided that the ALJs of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``SEC'') are inferior officers whose appointments were to 
be made by the SEC and not by the SEC's staff. Lucia v. SEC, 138 S. Ct. 
2044, 2053-54 (2018); see Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 512 (2010).
    On September 10, 2018, the Commission published a Federal Register 
notice that indicated that the Commission's then-existing ALJs, 
including Judge MaryJoan McNamara, had been ratified by the Commission 
in March of 2018. Notice, 83 FR 45678-79 (Sept. 10, 2018). The notice 
indicated that, as part of Clark S. Cheney's original appointment, the 
Commission, including the Chair, voted, by notational voting, in 
February of 2018 to appoint Judge Cheney as an ALJ. Id. By the same 
Commission vote that led to the issuance of the September 2018 notice, 
the Commission also ratified the appointments of, inter alia, Judges 
McNamara and Cheney. Id.
    Since that time, the Commission has hired Cameron Elliot, Monica 
Bhattacharyya, Bryan F. Moore, and Doris Johnson Hines as ALJs. As part 
of their original appointments, the

Commission, including the Chair, voted, by notational voting, to 
appoint each ALJ. In particular, the Commission voted to appoint Judge 
Elliot on March 4, 2019; Judge Bhattacharyya on August 12, 2021; Judge 
Moore on March 17, 2022; and Judge Johnson Hines on November 16, 2022. 
In addition, the Commission, including the Chair, voted on January 4, 
2022, to elevate Judge Cheney to Chief ALJ as part of his appointment 
as Chief ALJ.
    The hiring of the Commission's ALJs is, and has been, consistent 
with the Appointments Clause and with the Commission's organic statute. 
Accordingly, the Commission's ALJs have all been appointed and/or 
ratified in conformance with the Constitution and all applicable 
statutes and regulations. In addition, by this Notice, the Commission 
reiterates its approval of the appointments of Judges McNamara, Cheney, 
Elliot, Bhattacharyya, Moore, and Johnson Hines as its own under the 
Constitution.

    By order of the Commission.

    Issued: November 21, 2025.
Sharon Bellamy,
Supervisory Hearings and Information Officer.
