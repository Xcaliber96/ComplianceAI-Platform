SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Labor (Department), 
Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is submitting this 
Information Collection Request (ICR) to implement and collect an annual 
Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessment (RESEA) state plan as 
described in Section 306(e) of the Social Security Act (SSA). On 
February 9, 2018, the President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 
2018, Public Law 115-123 (BBA), which included amendments to the SSA 
that create a permanent authorization for the RESEA program. Section 
306 of the SSA introduced several new program requirements including 
the requirement that states must submit an annual state plan to be 
considered eligible for funding. To be considered eligible for RESEA 
funding for a Fiscal Year, a state must submit a state plan that 
outlines how the state intends to conduct a program of reemployment 
services and eligibility assessments by responding to all the required 
elements identified in Section 306(e) of the SSA and this ICR. For 
additional substantive information about this ICR, see the related 
notice published in the Federal Register on May 13, 2025 (90 FR 20316).
    Comments are invited on: (1) whether the collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Department, including whether the information will have practical 
utility; (2) the accuracy of the agency's estimates of the burden and 
cost of the collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility and clarity of the information collection; and (4) ways to 
minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are 
to respond, including the use of automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology.
    This information collection is subject to the PRA. A Federal agency 
generally cannot conduct or sponsor a collection of information, and 
the public is generally not required to respond to an information 
collection, unless the OMB approves it and displays a currently valid 
OMB Control Number. In addition, notwithstanding any other provisions 
of law, no person shall generally be subject to penalty for failing to 
comply with a collection of information that does not display a valid 
OMB Control Number. See 5 CFR 1320.5(a) and 1320.6.
    DOL seeks PRA authorization for this information collection for 
three (3) years. OMB authorization for an ICR cannot be for more than 
three (3) years without renewal. The DOL notes that information 
collection requirements submitted to the OMB for existing ICRs receive 
a month-to-month extension while they undergo review.
    Agency: DOL-ETA.
    Title of Collection: Required Elements of an Unemployment Insurance 
(UI) Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessment (RESEA) Grant 
State Plan.
    OMB Control Number: 1205-0538.
    Affected Public: State, Local and Tribal Government.
    Total Estimated Number of Respondents: 53.
    Total Estimated Number of Responses: 53.
