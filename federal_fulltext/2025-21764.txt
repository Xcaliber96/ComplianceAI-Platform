DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

Federal Aviation Administration

14 CFR Part 97

[Docket No. 31636; Amdt. No. 4193]


Standard Instrument Approach Procedures, and Takeoff Minimums and 
Obstacle Departure Procedures; Miscellaneous Amendments

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This rule establishes, amends, suspends, or removes Standard 
Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPS) and associated Takeoff Minimums 
and Obstacle Departure procedures (ODPs) for operations at certain 
airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption 
of new or revised criteria, or because of changes occurring in the 
National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational 
facilities, adding new obstacles, or changing air traffic requirements. 
These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the 
navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under 
instrument flight rules at the affected airports.

DATES: This rule is effective December 2, 2025. The compliance date for 
each SIAP, associated Takeoff Minimums, and ODP is specified in the 
amendatory provisions.
    The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in 
the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as 
of December 2, 2025.

ADDRESSES: Availability of matters incorporated by reference in the 
amendment is as follows:

copies may be obtained from the FAA Air Traffic Organization Service 
Area in which the affected airport is located.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Rune Duke, Manager (Acting), Standards 
Section, Flight Procedures and Airspace Group, Aviation Safety, Federal 
Aviation Administration. Mailing Address: FAA Mike Monroney

MacArthur Blvd., STB Annex, Bldg. 26, Room 217, Oklahoma City, OK

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule amends 14 CFR part 97 by 
establishing, amending, suspending, or removes SIAPS, Takeoff Minimums 
and/or ODPS. The complete regulatory description of each SIAP and its 
associated Takeoff Minimums or ODP for an identified airport is listed 
on FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this 
amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and 14 CFR 97.20. The 
applicable FAA Forms are 8260-3, 8260-4, 8260-5, 8260-15A, 8260-15B, 
when required by an entry on 8260-15A, and 8260-15C.
    The large number of SIAPs, Takeoff Minimums and ODPs, their complex 
nature, and the need for a special format make publication in the 
Federal Register expensive and impractical. Further, pilots do not use 
the regulatory text of the SIAPs, Takeoff Minimums or ODPs, but instead 
refer to their graphic depiction on charts printed by publishers of 
aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by 
reference are realized and

[[Page 55295]]

publication of the complete description of each SIAP, Takeoff Minimums 
and ODP listed on FAA form documents is unnecessary. This amendment 
provides the affected CFR sections and specifies the types of SIAPS, 
Takeoff Minimums and ODPs with their applicable effective dates. This 
amendment also identifies the airport and its location, the procedure, 
and the amendment number.

Availability and Summary of Material Incorporated by Reference

    The material incorporated by reference is publicly available as 
listed in the ADDRESSES section.
    The material incorporated by reference describes SIAPS, Takeoff 
Minimums and/or ODPs as identified in the amendatory language for part 
97 of this final rule.

The Rule

    This amendment to 14 CFR part 97 is effective upon publication of 
each separate SIAP, Takeoff Minimums and ODP as amended in the 
transmittal. Some SIAP and Takeoff Minimums and textual ODP amendments 
may have been issued previously by the FAA in a Flight Data Center 
(FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency action of immediate 
flights safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts.
    The circumstances that created the need for some SIAP and Takeoff 
Minimums and ODP amendments may require making them effective in less 
than 30 days. For the remaining SIAPs and Takeoff Minimums and ODPs, an 
effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.
    Further, the SIAPs and Takeoff Minimums and ODPs contained in this 
amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for 
Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs and 
Takeoff Minimums and ODPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the 
conditions existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of 
the close and immediate relationship between these SIAPs, Takeoff 
Minimums and ODPs, and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and 
public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary 
to the public interest and, where applicable, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d), 
good cause exists for making some SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.
    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an 
established body of technical regulations for which frequent and 
routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. 
It, therefore--(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under 
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); 
and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the 
anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA 
certifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
