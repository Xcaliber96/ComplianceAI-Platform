SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  The Office of Personnel Management, in 
accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 
3506(c)(2)(A)), provides the public with an opportunity to comment on 
proposed, revised, and continuing collections of information. This 
helps OPM assess the impact of its information collection requirements 
and minimize the public's reporting burden. It also helps the public 
understand OPM's information collection requirements and provide the 
requested data in the desired format.
    OPM is soliciting comments on the proposed information collection 
request (ICR) that is described below. OPM is especially interested in 
public comment addressing the following issues: (1) Is this collection 
necessary to the proper functions of the Agency; (2) will this 
information be processed and used in a timely manner; (3) is the 
estimate of burden accurate; (4) how might the Agency enhance the 
quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and 
(5) how might the Agency minimize the burden of this collection on the 
respondents, including through the use of information technology. 
Please note that written comments received in response to this notice 
will be considered public records.
    5 CFR 837.103, Reemployment of Annuitants, requires agencies to 
collect information from retirees who become employed in Government 
positions. Agencies need to collect timely information regarding the 
type and amount of annuity being received so the correct rate of pay 
can be determined. Agencies provide this information to OPM so a 
determination can be made whether the reemployed retiree's annuity must 
be terminated.
