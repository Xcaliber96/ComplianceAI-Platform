Information Collection Being Reviewed by the Federal 
Communications Commission

AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission.

ACTION: Notice and request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork burdens, 
and as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) invites the 
general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to 
comment on the following information collections. Comments are 
requested concerning: whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information shall have practical 
utility; the accuracy of the Commission's burden estimate; ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on the 
respondents, including the use of automated collection burden on small 
business concerns with fewer than 25 employees. The FCC may not conduct 
or sponsor a collection of information unless it displays a currently 
valid OMB control number. No person shall be subject to any penalty for 
failing to comply with a collection of information subject to the PRA 
that does not display a valid OMB control number.

DATES: Written PRA comments should be submitted on or before January 
26, 2026. If you anticipate that you will be submitting comments but 
find it difficult to do so within the period of time allowed by this 
notice, you should advise the contact listed below as soon as possible.

ADDRESSES: Direct all PRA comments to Cathy Williams, FCC, via email 
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#15454754557376763b727a63"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="164644575670757538717960">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> and to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cb88aabfa3b2e59ca2a7a7a2aaa6b88bada8a8e5aca4bd"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="682b091c0011463f0104040109051b280e0b0b460f071e">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Title: Implementation of the Subscriber Carrier Selection Changes 
Provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Policies and Rules 
Concerning Unauthorized Changes of Consumers' Long Distance Carriers, 
CC Docket No. 94-129, CG Docket 17-169.

    Number of Respondents and Responses: 1,178 respondents; 3,817 
responses.
    Estimated Time per Response: 30 minutes (.50 hours) to 10 hours.
    Frequency of Response: Recordkeeping requirement; Biennial, on 
occasion and one-time reporting requirements; Third party disclosure

    Obligation to Respond: Required to obtain or retain benefits. The 
statutory authority for the information collection requirements is

Selections, Public Law 104-104, 110 Stat. 56.
    Total Annual Burden: 8,692 hours.
    Total Annual Cost: $2,630,000.
    Needs and Uses: Section 258 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 
(1996 Act) directed the Commission to prescribe rules to prevent the 
unauthorized change by telecommunications carriers of consumers' 
selections of telecommunications service providers (slamming). On March 
17, 2003, the FCC released the Third Order on Reconsideration and 
Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, CC Docket No. 94-129, FCC 
03-42 (Third Order on Reconsideration), in which the Commission revised 
and clarified certain rules to implement section 258 of the 1996 Act. 
On May 23, 2003, the Commission released an Order (CC Docket No. 94-
129, FCC 03-116) clarifying certain aspects of the Third Order on 
Reconsideration. On January 9, 2008, the Commission released the Fourth 
Report and Order, CC Docket No. 94-129, FCC 07-223, revising its 
requirements concerning verification of a consumer's intent to switch 
carriers.
    The Fourth Report and Order modified the information collection 
requirements contained in Sec.  64.1120(c)(3)(iii) of the Commission's 
rules to provide for verifications to elicit ``confirmation that the 
person on the call understands that a carrier change, not an upgrade to 
existing service, bill consolidation, or any other misleading 
description of the transaction, is being authorized.''

Federal Communications Commission.

Secretary.
