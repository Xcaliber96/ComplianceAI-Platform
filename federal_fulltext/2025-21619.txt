Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration

[Docket No. FMCSA-2025-0688]


Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation; Application 
for Exemption From Intelligent Motorist Alert Messaging Systems

AGENCY: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), DOT.

ACTION: Notice of application for exemption; request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: FMCSA requests public comment on an application for a 5-year 
exemption submitted by Intelligent Motorist Alert Messaging Systems 
(IMAMS). The applicant seeks an exemption for autonomous commercial 
motor vehicles (CMVs) from the regulation that requires the use of 
traditional warning devices to alert other vehicles when the CMV has 
become disabled. The exemption would allow autonomous CMVs to use IMAMS 
dynamic digital LED messaging platform as an alternative to traditional 
warning devices. FMCSA requests public comment on IMAMS's application.

DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 31, 2025.

II. Legal Basis

    FMCSA has authority under 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b) to grant 
exemptions from Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). 
FMCSA must publish a notice of each exemption request in the Federal 
Register (49 CFR 381.315(a)). The Agency must provide the public an 
opportunity to inspect the information relevant to the application, 
including the applicant's safety analysis. The Agency must provide an 
opportunity for public comment on the request.
    The Agency reviews the application, safety analyses, and public 
comments submitted and determines whether granting the exemption would 
likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the 
level that would be achieved without the exemption, pursuant to the 
standard set forth in 49 CFR 381.305(a)). The Agency must publish its 
decision in the Federal Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, the 
notice will identify the regulatory provision from which the applicant 
will be exempt, the effective period, and all terms and conditions of 
the exemption (49 CFR 381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption is denied, the 
notice will explain the reason for the denial (49 CFR 381.315(c)(2)). 
The exemption may be renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)).

III. Applicant's Request

Current Regulatory Requirements

    The applicable FMCSRs in 49 CFR 392.22(b) require the driver of a 
CMV stopped on the traveled portion or the shoulder of a highway for 
any cause other than a necessary traffic stop to activate hazard 
warning signal flashers and place required warning devices as soon as 
possible, but within ten minutes, at specified locations behind and in 
front of the stopped CMV. The regulations also prescribe placement of

[[Page 55237]]

warning devices in certain circumstances, such as during daylight 
hours, or when the CMV is stopped within 500 feet of a curve, the crest 
of a hill, or any other obstruction that prevents clear visibility. (49 
CFR 392.22(b)(2)).
    In addition, the FMCSRs specify the types and number of warning 
devices that may be used. Specifically, each CMV must be equipped with 
three bidirectional emergency reflective triangles, or at least six 
fusees, or three liquid-burning flares. (49 CFR 393.95(f)(1) and (2)). 
Other devices may be used in addition to the required ones, provided 
they do not reduce the effectiveness of the required devices. (49 CFR 
393.95(f)(3)).

Applicant's Request

    The application requests an exemption from the requirements of 49 
CFR 392.22(b)(1) and (2) to allow the use of IMAMS dynamic digital LED 
messaging platform as an alternative safety system for disabled, 
autonomous CMVs on the road, which the applicant asserts will enhance 
motorist awareness and roadway safety. The IMAMS platform is a dynamic 
digital LED messaging sign that is securely mounted on the rear doors 
and front dash of semi-trailers and large CMVs.
    The application explains that when an autonomous vehicle activates 
its emergency flashers, the IMAMS platform will automatically display a 
series of high-visibility, LED-lit messages to oncoming traffic. These 
messages cycle through ``ALERT-ALERT'' (in red), ``MOVE OVER'' (in 
amber), ``SLOW DOWN'' (in amber), and ``DISABLED VEHICLE'' (in amber), 
providing clear, immediate warnings.
    The applicant emphasizes that IMAMS is an equivalent or superior 
alternative to traditional warning devices, as it activates 
automatically, which eliminates the delay and risks associated with 
manual placement of triangles or flares.
    Although the application did not specifically request an exemption 
from 49 CFR 393.95(f)(1) and (2), FMCSA notes that the application 
would require an exemption from this section as it specifies the types 
and number of warning devices that are to be equipped on each power 
unit. These options include 3 bidirectional emergency reflective 
triangles that conform to the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle 
Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 125, or at least 6 fusees or 3 liquid-
burning flares as are necessary to satisfy the requirements of Sec.  
392.22. Under the regulations, other warning devices may be used in 
addition to, but not in lieu of, the required devices provided that 
they do not reduce the effectiveness of the required devices. 
Accordingly, if FMCSA were to allow the IMAMS platform as the sole 
emergency warning device, an exemption from 49 CFR 393.95(f)(1) and (2) 
would be necessary.
    A copy of IMAMS's application for exemption, and all supporting 
materials, are available for review in the docket for this notice.

IV. Request for Comments

    In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31315(b), FMCSA requests public 
comment from all interested persons on IMAMS's application for a five-
year exemption from 49 CFR 392.22(b)(1) and(2) and 49 CFR 393.95(f)(1) 
and (2).
    All comments received before the close of business on the comment 
closing date will be considered and will be available for examination 
in the docket at the location listed under the Addresses section of 
this notice. Comments received after the comment closing date will be 
filed in the public docket and may be considered to the extent 
practicable. In addition to late comments, FMCSA will also continue to 
file, in the public docket, relevant information that becomes available 
after the comment closing date. Interested persons should continue to 
examine the public docket for new material.

Associate Administrator for Policy.
