SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    1. In this notice of inquiry, the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (Commission) seeks information and stakeholder perspectives 
to help the Commission explore whether, and if so how, to revise its 
Part 153, 157, and 380 regulations to establish procedures for 
authorizing activities at liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants \1\ 
without the need for case-specific authorization

applications and orders under sections 3 or 7 of the Natural Gas Act 
(NGA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ LNG facilities make up the larger LNG plant. LNG plants 
include LNG terminals authorized under section 3 of the NGA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Background

A. Statutory Framework

    2. The Commission regulates the siting, construction, expansion, 
and operation of LNG facilities pursuant to sections 3 and 7 of the 
NGA. Section 3(a) provides for federal jurisdiction over the siting, 
construction, expansion, and operation of facilities used to export or 
import natural gas.\2\ Section 3(e)(1) states that ``[t]he Commission 
shall have the exclusive authority to approve or deny an application 
for the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of an LNG 
terminal.'' \3\ And under section 7(c), the Commission issues 
certificates of public convenience and necessity for natural gas and 
LNG facilities used for the transportation of natural gas in interstate 
commerce.\4\ Under both section 3 and section 7, the Commission has the 
authority to include terms and conditions in any order authorizing an 
LNG facility.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 15 U.S.C. 717b(a). The 1977 Department of Energy (DOE) 
Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7151(b)) placed all section 3 
jurisdiction under DOE. The Secretary of Energy subsequently 
delegated authority to the Commission to ``[a]pprove or disapprove 
the construction and operation of particular facilities, the site at 
which such facilities shall be located, and with respect to natural 
gas that involves the construction of new domestic facilities, the 
place of entry for imports or exit for exports.'' DOE Delegation 
Order S1-DEL-FERC-2006, section 1.21A (May 16, 2006). See 
EarthReports, Inc. v. FERC, 828 F.3d 949, 952-53 (D.C. Cir. 2016) 
(detailing how regulatory oversight for the export of LNG and 
supporting facilities is divided between the Commission and DOE).
    \3\ 15 U.S.C. 717b(e)(1). LNG terminal is defined as: ``all 
natural gas facilities located onshore or in State waters that are 
used to receive, unload, load, store, transport, gasify, liquefy, or 
process natural gas that is imported to the United States . . . , 
exported to a foreign country . . . , or transported in interstate 
commerce by waterborne vessel, but does not include (A) waterborne 
vessels used to deliver natural gas to or from any such facility; or 
(B) any pipeline or storage facility subject to the jurisdiction of 
the Commission under [section 7].'' Id. 717a(11).
    \4\ Id. 717f(c)(1)(A).
    \5\ Id. 717b(a), 717b(e)(3), 717f(e). For a discussion of the 
Commission's authority to condition its approvals of LNG facilities 
under section 3 of the NGA, see, e.g., Distrigas Corp. v. FPC, 495 
F.2d 1057, 1063-64 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 834 
(1974); Dynegy LNG Prod. Terminal, L.P., 97 FERC ] 61,231 (2001).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. The NGA also includes additional requirements that must be met 
prior to authorizing the construction of LNG terminals.\6\ Pursuant to 
section 3A(a) of the NGA,\7\ the Commission promulgated regulations 
requiring LNG operators to use a pre-filing process for an application 
for authorization to construct or modify an LNG terminal.\8\ Section 
3(f) requires that the Commission obtain the concurrence of the 
Secretary of War before authorizing the siting, construction, 
expansion, or operation of LNG facilities affecting the training or 
activities of an active military installation.\9\ Section 3A(e) states 
that ``[i]n any order authorizing an LNG terminal the Commission shall 
require the LNG terminal operator to develop an Emergency Response Plan 
[that] shall be prepared in consultation with the United States Coast 
Guard and State and local agencies and be approved by the Commission 
prior to any final approval to begin construction [and] shall include a 
cost-sharing plan.'' \10\ The plan is to describe any direct cost 
reimbursements that the applicant will provide to state and local 
agencies responsible for safety and security at the LNG terminal and in 
proximity to vessels that serve the facility.\11\ Additionally, section 
3A(c) allows states to provide a report on state and local safety 
considerations which ``the Commission shall review and respond 
specifically to the issues raised . . . .'' \12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ These requirements do not apply to NGA section 7 LNG 
facilities, including LNG peak shaving facilities which store gas in 
interstate commerce.
    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 717b-1(a).
    \8\ 18 CFR 157.21. The Commission's regulations allow for the 
Director of the Office of Energy Projects to waive the mandatory 
pre-filing procedures when prospective modifications to an existing 
LNG terminal do not involve significant state and local safety 
considerations that have not been previously addressed.
    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 717b(f). Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding 
with the Department of War, the Commission issues a letter to the 
Department, which then responds indicating whether or not there are 
no or minimal impacts to military installations and operations.
    \10\ Id. 717b-1(e).
    \11\ Id.
    \12\ Id. 717b-1(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. Modifications to already-approved, operating LNG facilities may 
need to be undertaken during the life of the facilities.\13\ Such 
modifications may currently necessitate that the operator file a case-
specific application, on which the Commission will make a public 
interest determination.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ LNG projects occurring during operation may include: safety 
system installations, existing equipment upgrades or replacements, 
emissions controls, system modifications to enable integration with 
non-jurisdictional activities (helium extraction or offsite carbon 
capture and sequestration), uprates, extra power generation, and new 
LNG trains, storage tanks, or loading berths.
    \14\ 18 CFR part 153 (detailing the requirements for 
applications filed pursuant to section 3 of the NGA); 18 CFR part 
157 (detailing the requirements for applications filed pursuant to 
section 7 of the NGA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Existing Regulations for Authorizing Routine Activities Under 
Section 7

    5. Under Part 157, Subpart F of the Commission's regulations,\15\ 
interstate pipelines that hold a certificate of public convenience and 
necessity under NGA section 7 may apply for a one-time blanket 
certificate to undertake, without a case-specific authorization, 
certain activities automatically, subject only to annual reporting 
requirements \16\ and certain other activities after prior notice,\17\ 
both subject to cost limits.\18\ The blanket certificate program 
``provide[s] streamlined procedures which increase flexibility and 
reduce regulatory burden'' for a generic class of routine activities 
with particular conditions and procedures for consistency with the 
Commission's statutory obligations under the NGA and environmental 
statutes.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ 18 CFR part 157, subpart F.
    \16\ Id. 157.203(b), 157.208(a), (e).
    \17\ Id. 157.203(c), 157.208(b).
    \18\ Id. 157.208(d), 157.215(a)(5). The cost limits are adjusted 
each year to reflect the ``GDP implicit price deflator'' published 
by the Department of Commerce for the previous calendar year. Id. 
157.208(d).
    \19\ Interstate Pipeline Certificates for Routine Transactions, 
Order No. 234, 47 FR 24254, at 24256, 24263 (June 4, 1982), FERC 
Stats. & Regs. ] 30,368, at 30,201 (1982) (cross-referenced at 19 
FERC ] 61,216); see also Revisions to the Blanket Certificate 
Reguls. & Clarification Regarding Rates, Order No. 686, 71 FR 63680 
(Oct. 31, 2006), 117 FERC ] 61,074, at P 7 (2006) (``The blanket 
certificate program was designed to provide an administratively 
efficient means to authorize a generic class of routine activities, 
without subjecting each minor project to a full, case-specific NGA 
section 7 certificate proceeding.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. In 1982, in instituting the blanket certificate program, the 
Commission explained that:

    [T]he final regulations divide the various actions that the 
Commission certificates into several categories. The first category 
applies to certain activities performed by interstate pipelines that 
either have relatively little impact on ratepayers, or little effect 
on pipeline operations. This first category also includes minor 
investments in facilities which are so well understood as an 
established industry practice that little scrutiny is required to 
determine their compatibility with the public convenience and 
necessity. The second category of activities provides for a notice 
and protest procedure and comprises certain activities in which 
various interested parties might have a concern. In such cases there 
is a need to provide an opportunity for a greater degree of review 
and to provide for possible adjudication of controversial aspects. 
Activities not authorized under the blanket certificate are those 
activities which may have a major potential impact on ratepayers, or 
which propose such important considerations that close scrutiny and 
case-specific deliberation by the Commission is

[[Page 53253]]

warranted prior to the issuance of a certificate.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ Order No. 234, FERC Stats. & Regs. ] 30,368 at 30,200.

    7. The notice and protest procedures for prior notice projects 
allow anyone, including Commission staff, to protest a prior notice 
project within 60 days and, if a protest is not withdrawn or dismissed, 
the project is reviewed as an application for case-specific 
authorization under NGA section 7(c).\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ 18 CFR 157.205(h).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    8. Blanket certificate activities are subject to the conditions in 
the Commission's regulations implementing the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA),\22\ as well as requirements that all blanket 
certificate activities be consistent with all applicable laws, 
including the Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation 
Act, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and other applicable statutes 
relating to environmental concerns.\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ Id. part 380. Certain activities undertaken pursuant to the 
blanket certificate are categorically excluded from NEPA review. Id. 
380.4(a)(21).
    \23\ Id. 157.206.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9. In addition to the blanket program, Sec.  2.55 of the 
Commission's regulations allows pipeline companies to perform auxiliary 
installations and facility replacements at section 7(c) facilities 
without a case-specific authorization.\24\ For activities undertaken 
pursuant to either the blanket certificate program or Sec.  2.55, 
section 7(c) certificate holders are required to provide advance notice 
to affected landowners.\25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ Id. 2.55. LNG facilities authorized under section 7 of the 
NGA may use the procedures outlined in Sec.  2.55.
    \25\ Id. 157.203(d)(1) (requiring affected landowners to be 
notified of automatic authorization projects at least 45 days prior 
to commencing construction or at the time it initiates easement 
negotiations, whichever is earlier); id. 157.203(d)(2) (requiring 
affected landowners to be notified of prior notice projects within 
three days following the date that a docket number is assigned to 
the application or at the time it initiates easement negotiations, 
whichever is earlier); id. 2.55(c) (requiring a good faith effort to 
notify in writing each affected landowner at least five days prior 
to commencing any activity except for activities for which all 
ground disturbance will be within an existing above-ground site or 
those done for safety, DOT compliance, or environmental or unplanned 
maintenance that are not foreseen and that require immediate 
attention).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    10. In two earlier blanket certificate rulemakings decades prior to 
this, the Commission declined to extend the program to include LNG 
facilities. In the 1982 rulemaking, the Commission excluded LNG 
facilities from the program, finding that they ``may have a significant 
impact on ratepayers'' and therefore ``should not be authorized under a 
blanket certificate, but should be subjected instead to the scrutiny of 
a case-specific determination.'' \26\ In 2006, the Commission revised 
its blanket certificate regulations but again declined to extend the 
program to include LNG facilities.\27\ The Commission explained that 
``LNG plant facilities are not within the class of minor, well-
understood, routine activities that the blanket certificate program is 
intended to embrace; LNG plant facilities necessarily require a review 
of engineering, environmental, safety, and security issues that the 
Commission believes only can be properly considered on a case-by-case 
basis.'' \28\ The Commission summarized on rehearing that ``the blanket 
certificate program is not well suited to address the complexity 
inherent in issues raised by LNG . . . facilities.'' \29\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    11. The Commission's experience with LNG facilities in the United 
States has changed considerably since the 1982 and 2006 rulemakings. As 
mentioned above, the 2006 rulemaking stated that the complexity of 
issues raised by LNG facilities, and the Commission's limited 
experience with these issues at the time, precluded including them in 
the blanket program.\30\ Since that time, both the Commission and 
industry have gained significant experience regarding the engineering, 
environmental, safety, and security issues at LNG plants. The 
Commission has evaluated more than 100 LNG project applications since 
2006 under NGA section 3 and 7. Staff have also engaged in extensive 
coordination with the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Pipeline and 
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) and the US Coast 
Guard (USCG), which are also involved in safety for these facilities, 
to proactively develop established safety standards and best practices 
with the LNG industry.\31\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ Id. PP 22-23.
    \31\ In individual proceedings, the Commission has issued over 
4,500 requirements, including approximately 4,000 requirements that 
have been coordinated with PHMSA and the USCG regarding the 
engineering, safety, security, and reliability of those projects in 
accordance with a 2004 Interagency Agreement. Interagency Agreement 
Among the FERC, USCG, and [PHMSA] for the Safety and Security Review 
of Waterfront Import/Export LNG Facilities, February 11, 2004, 
<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/media/2004-interagency-dot-and-uscg">https://www.ferc.gov/media/2004-interagency-dot-and-uscg</a>, Accessed 
October 2025. Approximately 30 of these orders were issued after a 
2018 Memorandum of Understanding with DOT for coordination between 
the Commission and PHMSA on determining whether proposed LNG 
facilities comply with PHMSA's siting requirements contained in 49 
CFR part 193 Subpart B. Interagency Agreement Among the FERC, USCG, 
and [PHMSA] for the Safety and Security Review of Waterfront Import/
Export LNG Facilities, February 11, 2004, <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/media/2004-interagency-dot-and-uscg">https://www.ferc.gov/media/2004-interagency-dot-and-uscg</a>, Accessed October 2025. 
Commission staff, along with DOT PHMSA and US Coast Guard 
representatives, have also actively participated in an LNG Technical 
Committee and Commission staff has made over 300 proposals since 
2016 to update subsequent versions of the National Fire Protection 
Association (NFPA) 59A, Standard for the Production, Storage, and 
Handling of LNG, to improve the safety, security, and reliability of 
LNG projects consistent with the requirements that the Commission 
imposes on LNG facilities in its authorization orders.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    12. Changes in the LNG market have also led to an expansion in the 
number of projects that the Commission regulates. Since 2006, the 
United States has emerged as the world's largest LNG exporter with 
seven large-scale LNG export terminals currently in operation, eight 
new or expanded export projects in construction, and additional 
terminals and expansions expected over the next several years. Although 
certain changes and variances are permitted during LNG terminal 
construction, changes to an operating LNG terminal--in some cases even 
routine adjustments like equipment replacements--may currently require 
a case-specific authorization. With more LNG facilities in operation in 
the United States, the current case-by-case review process for certain 
replacements, modifications, and expansions may be administratively 
inefficient, slow down needed projects, and create unnecessary 
regulatory uncertainty. In addition, many LNG facilities under section 
7 have been in operation for 50 years. While many have been able to 
replace existing facilities under Sec.  2.55 provisions, there is less 
regulatory certainty whether those provisions can be used to make 
replacements, modifications, or expansions to accommodate changes in 
feed gas compositions, changes in technology, or other conditions. 
Thus, the Commission believes that reconsidering allowing an automatic 
and/or prior-notice authorization program for certain activities is 
warranted.

II. Subject of the Notice of Inquiry

    13. The Commission is issuing this notice of inquiry to consider 
whether, and if so how, to revise its Part 153, 157, and 380 
regulations to establish procedures for authorizing certain activities 
at LNG plants without a case-specific authorization order, to provide 
regulatory certainty and significantly streamline liquefied natural gas

[[Page 53254]]

infrastructure permitting. The Commission seeks comment on the 
following questions:

A. Process-Related Questions

    A1. If the Commission promulgates rules to allow for the 
construction, expansion, and operation of facilities without a case-
specific section 3 authorization, should the Commission require each 
LNG operator to apply for a blanket section 3 authorization as it does 
for natural gas pipelines pursuant to Part 157, Subpart F (see 18 CFR 
157.204(a)) or should all current and new LNG operators be 
automatically granted a blanket authorization?
    A2. How, if at all, should the Commission factor in a current LNG 
operator's compliance history when determining whether to grant blanket 
section 3 authorization?
    A3. Under the Commission's existing Part 157, Subpart F blanket 
certificate regulations for activities under NGA section 7, there is a 
two-tiered process whereby some activities are automatically authorized 
while others require prior notice (see 18 CFR 157.203(a)-(c)). Should 
the Commission adopt a similar tiered approach for activities at LNG 
terminals under section 3? If so, should there be additional or 
different tiers?
    A4. If the Commission allows for the construction, expansion, 
operation, and modification of certain LNG facilities without prior 
notice under a blanket section 3 authorization, should the Commission:
    a. require LNG operators to notify Commission staff of any proposed 
modifications prior to implementing them, similar to the notification 
requirements in Sec.  2.55(b)(1)(iii)? And, if so, is 30 days' notice 
sufficient?; and/or
    b. require an LNG operator to file a semi-annual or annual report 
documenting the activities undertaken during the previous calendar year 
pursuant to the blanket authorization program? Is including this 
information in the current semiannual report sufficient? What 
information should be included in such reports?
    A5. If the Commission requires prior notice for some or all 
activities under a blanket section 3 authorization, should the 
Commission adopt the same notice requirements as those detailed in the 
Commission's blanket certificate regulations, including Commission 
issuance of a notice within 10 days of filing if the filing is not 
rejected and a 60-day notice period thereafter for filing protests and 
interventions (see 18 CFR 157.205)?
    A6. Should the Commission adopt the same process concerning 
protests to prior notice section 3 LNG projects as is currently in 
place for prior notice blanket certificate pipeline projects, i.e. that 
if a protest is filed and not withdrawn or dismissed, the application 
will treated as a request for a section 3 authorization (see 18 CFR 
157.205), or should a different process be required? If a different 
process should be required, which types of protests should be 
dismissed, if any?
    A7. What stakeholder (e.g., affected landowner and local, state, 
and federal agencies) notification requirements should the Commission 
adopt for projects constructed pursuant to a blanket authorization 
program?
    A8. Should the Commission require LNG facilities under a blanket 
section 3 or 7 authorization be constructed and placed into service 
within a specified timeframe? If so, what timeframe?

B. Project Eligibility

    B1. LNG projects occurring during operation may include, but are 
not limited to: (i) replacements of, modifications to, or new 
facilities, systems, or components that improve efficiency, capacity, 
reliability, safety, or emissions and lessen adverse impacts to the 
public; (ii) replacements of, modifications to, or new facilities, 
systems, or components that increase capacity of pretreatment, 
liquefaction, storage, transfer, or auxiliary facilities without 
exceeding previously evaluated resource impacts identified in the NEPA 
process associated with the plant's underlying authorizations; or (iii) 
replacements of, modifications to, or new facilities, systems, or 
components that are identical to those previously evaluated and 
authorized by the Commission. If the Commission adopts a tiered 
approach similar to that in the blanket certificate regulations for 
natural gas pipelines (18 CFR 157.203(b)-(c)), what categories of 
projects should be eligible for automatic authorization? What 
categories of projects should be eligible for prior notice 
authorization? How should the Commission divide these categories, e.g., 
based on costs, infrastructure types, or anticipated environmental 
effects, based on one or more of safety, security, operability, or 
reliability concerns, based on the impact on LNG production or export 
capacity, or based on other factors?
    B2. What activities and modifications at authorized and existing 
LNG plants would result in no adverse impacts to the environment or 
safety? Specifically, what types of LNG facility modifications, 
systems, or components would have no or beneficial impacts to the 
following resources:

<bullet> Water Resources;
<bullet> Water Bodies and Wetlands;
<bullet> Wildlife, including Threatened and Endangered Species;
<bullet> Vegetation;
<bullet> Cultural Resources;
<bullet> Socioeconomics;
<bullet> Geological Resources;
<bullet> Soils;
<bullet> Land Use;
<bullet> Recreation;
<bullet> Visual Resources;
<bullet> Air Quality;
<bullet> Noise;
<bullet> Reliability; and
<bullet> Safety.

    B3. What categories of LNG projects would provide equivalent or 
greater level of environmental protection and safety as compared to 
what is authorized at an existing LNG plant? Specifically, what types 
of LNG facility modifications, systems, or components would result in 
different impacts but nevertheless provide an equivalent or greater 
level of protection to the resources listed in question B2?
    B4. What categories of LNG projects would result in less than 
significant impacts to the environment and safety at authorized and 
existing LNG plants such that the Commission could categorically 
determine that such projects are not inconsistent with the public 
interest under NGA section 3, or are or will be required by the present 
or future public convenience and necessity under NGA section 7? 
Specifically, what types of LNG facility modifications, systems, or 
components would result in less than significant impacts to the 
resources listed in question B2?
    B5. Should the Commission allow the construction and operation of 
additional facilities under a blanket section 3 or 7 LNG authorization 
program to occur outside the authorized LNG plant limits? If so, what 
should the restrictions or criteria be for construction outside the 
authorized plant limits?
    B6. Should the Commission revise its Part 157 blanket certificate 
regulations to include modifications to LNG facilities under section 7? 
If so, what types of projects should be subject to automatic 
authorization and prior notice?
    B7. Should the Commission require different cost limits for LNG 
facilities under section 7 than for other interstate natural gas 
facilities? Are cost-based limits appropriate for these LNG facilities? 
Should there be any other considerations beyond cost and those listed 
above?

C. Statutory and Regulatory Compliance

    C1. How should applicants demonstrate that: (1) other federal

[[Page 53255]]

permitting agencies have been consulted and that all necessary federal 
authorizations are received prior to construction; (2) the modified LNG 
facilities would meet the federal siting requirements promulgated by 
PHMSA; (3) a Letter of Intent and Waterways Safety Assessment has been 
filed with the USCG and a Letter of Recommendation that determines the 
waterway to be suitable has been issued by the USCG; (4) the Department 
of War has concurred that there would be no or minimal impacts to 
military installations, training, and operations; (5) state and local 
safety considerations have been addressed prior to construction of
