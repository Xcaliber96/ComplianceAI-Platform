SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Deletions

    On September 11, 2025 (90 FR 44051) and September 25, 2025 (90 FR 
46186), the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or 
Severely Disabled published notice of proposed deletions from the 
Procurement List. This notice is published pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 8503 
(a)(2) and 41 CFR 51-2.3.
    After consideration of the relevant matter presented, the Committee 
has determined that the product(s) and service(s) listed below are no 
longer suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 
U.S.C. 8501-8506 and 41 CFR 51-2.4.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification

    I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors 
considered for this certification were:
    1. The action will not result in additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities.
    2. The action may result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the product(s) and service(s) to the Government.
    3. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 
8501-8506) in connection with the product(s) and service(s) deleted 
from the Procurement List.
