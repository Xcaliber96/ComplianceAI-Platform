SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Comments Invited

    The FAA invites you to send any written relevant data, views, or 
arguments about this proposal. Send your comments using a method listed 
under the ADDRESSES section. Include ``Docket No. FAA-2025-1362; 
Project Identifier MCAI-2025-00062-G'' at the beginning of your 
comments. The most helpful comments reference a specific portion of the 
proposal, explain the reason for any recommended change, and include 
supporting data. The FAA will consider all comments received by the 
closing date and may again revise this proposal because of those 
comments.
    Except for Confidential Business Information (CBI) as described in 
the following paragraph, and other information as described in 14 CFR 
11.35, the FAA will post all comments received, without change, to 
<a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a>, including any personal information you provide. The 
agency will also post a report summarizing each substantive verbal 
contact received about this SNPRM.

Confidential Business Information

    CBI is commercial or financial information that is both customarily 
and actually treated as private by its owner. Under the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), CBI is exempt from public 
disclosure. If your comments responsive to this SNPRM contain 
commercial or financial information that is customarily treated as 
private, that you actually treat as private, and that is relevant or 
responsive to this SNPRM, it is important that you clearly designate 
the submitted comments as CBI. Please mark each page of your submission 
containing CBI as ``PROPIN.'' The FAA will treat such marked 
submissions as confidential under the FOIA, and they will not be placed 
in the public docket of this SNPRM. Submissions containing CBI should 
be sent to Peter Schmitt, Aviation Safety Engineer, FAA, 1600 Stewart 
Avenue, Suite 410, Westbury, NY 11590. Any commentary that the FAA 
receives which is not specifically designated as CBI will be placed in 
the public docket for this rulemaking.

Background

    The FAA issued an NPRM to amend 14 CFR part 39 by adding an AD that 
would apply to certain Schempp-Hirth Model CIRRUS gliders. The NPRM was 
published in the Federal Register on July 22, 2025 (90 FR 34391). The 
NPRM was prompted by European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD 
2024-0242R1, dated January 17, 2025, issued by EASA, which is the 
Technical Agent for the Member States of the European Union (EASA AD 
2024-0242R1) (also referred to as the MCAI). The MCAI states that 
occurrences were reported of a broken outer race in the lower ball 
bearing installed on the all-moving horizontal tailplane drive fitting. 
This condition, if not addressed, could lead to the tailplane drive 
jamming and loss of control of the glider.
    In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to require inspecting the elevator 
drive fitting to determine the type of lower ball bearing installed 
and, depending upon the results, replacing the lower ball bearing with 
a serviceable part.
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2025-1362.

Actions Since the NPRM Was Issued

    Since the FAA issued the NPRM, a commenter noted that the NPRM 
referenced the incorrect glider model. The SNPRM revises the NPRM by 
updating the reference to the affected Schempp-Hirth glider model from 
CIRRUS to STANDARD CIRRUS. Neither the MCAI nor the service information 
has been revised since the NPRM was published. This SNPRM was prompted 
by the FAA's determination that the affected glider model referenced in 
the NPRM was incorrect and needed to be changed. The FAA is proposing 
this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

Comments

    The FAA received one comment from an individual commenter. The 
following presents the comment received on the NPRM and the FAA's 
response to the comment.

Request To Correct Glider Model Applicability

    An individual commenter requested that the FAA revise the proposed 
AD by changing the referenced applicability to Schempp-Hirth Model 
STANDARD CIRRUS sailplanes rather than Schempp-Hirth Model CIRRUS 
sailplanes. The commenter noted that the CIRRUS sailplane is a 
different type of glider model than the STANDARD CIRRUS sailplane with 
a different type of elevator.
    The FAA agrees with the commenter's request and has revised this 
proposed AD as requested.

FAA's Determination

    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority 
of another country and are approved for operation in the United States. 
Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design 
Authority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA is issuing this SNPRM 
after determining that the unsafe condition described previously is 
likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design.
    Certain changes described above expand the scope of the NPRM. As a 
result, it is necessary to reopen the comment period to provide 
additional opportunity for the public to comment on this SNPRM.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed SCHEMPP-HIRTH Flugzeugbau GmbH Technical Note No. 
278-25, Revision 1, dated July 9, 2024, which specifies procedures for 
inspecting the elevator drive fitting to determine which type of lower 
ball bearing is installed, and depending on the results, replacing the 
lower ball bearing with a serviceable part.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Proposed AD Requirements in This SNPRM

    This proposed AD would require accomplishing the actions specified 
in the material already described.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD, if adopted as proposed, would 
affect 17 gliders of U.S. registry.
    The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this proposed 
AD:

 installed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FAA estimates the following costs to do any necessary 
replacements that would be required based on the results of the 
proposed inspection. The agency has no way of determining the number of 
gliders that might need these replacements:

                                               On-Condition Costs

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship 
between the national government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed 
regulation:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
