SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Comments

    Written comments and suggestions from the public and affected 
agencies concerning the proposed collection of information should 
address one or more of the following four points:
    (1) Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, 
including whether the information will have practical utility;
    (2) Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    (3) Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and
    (4) Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those 
who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, 
electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic 
submission of responses.

Overview of This Information Collection

    (1) Type of Information Collection: Extension, Without Change, of a 
Previously Approved Collection.
    (2) Title of the Form/Collection: Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) Mutual Agreement Between Government and Employers 
(IMAGE) Self-Assessment Questionnaire.
    (3) Agency form number, if any, and the applicable component of the 
Department of Homeland Security sponsoring the collection: 73-028; U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
    (4) Affected public who will be asked or required to respond, as 
well as a brief abstract: Primary: Business or other for-profit; Not-
for-profit institutions. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
Mutual Agreement Between Government and Employers (IMAGE) program is 
the outreach and education component of the Homeland Security 
Investigations (HSI) Worksite Enforcement (WSE) program. IMAGE is 
designed to build cooperative relationships with the private sector to 
enhance compliance with immigration laws and reduce the number of 
unauthorized aliens within the American workforce. Under this program 
ICE will partner with businesses representing a cross-section of 
industries. A business will initially complete and prepare an IMAGE 
application so that ICE can properly evaluate the company for inclusion 
in the IMAGE program. The information provided by the company plays a 
vital role in determining its suitability for the program. While 8 
U.S.C. 1324(a) makes it illegal to knowingly employ a person who is not 
in the U.S. legally, there is no requirement for any entity in the 
private sector to participate in the program and the information 
obtained from the company should also be available to the public.
    (5) An estimate of the total number of respondents and the amount 
of time estimated for an average respondent to respond: 66 responses at 
90 minutes (1.5 hours) per response.
    (6) An estimate of the total public burden (in hours) associated 
with the collection: The total estimated annual hour burden is 99 
hours.
