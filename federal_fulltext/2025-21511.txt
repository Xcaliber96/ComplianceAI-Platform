SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: CPSC seeks to renew the following currently 
approved collection of information:

[[Page 54645]]

    Title: Safety Standard for Clothing Storage Units.
    OMB Number: 3041-0191.
    Type of Review: Renewal of collection.
    Frequency of Response: On occasion.
    Affected Public: Manufacturers and importers of clothing storage 
units.
    General Description of Collection: Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 2056f, 
CPSC promulgated a consumer product safety standard to protect against 
tip-over of clothing storage units (CSUs). 16 CFR part 1261. That 
standard incorporates by reference ASTM F2057-23, Standard Safety 
Specification for Clothing Storage Units. Id. 1261.2. A CSU is defined 
as a ``furniture item with drawers and/or hinged doors intended for the 
storage of clothing typical with bedroom furniture.'' Section 3.1.3, 
ASTM F2057-23. The standard's requirements include warning labels that 
contain certain statements and pictograms. These requirements fall 
within the definition of ``collection of information,'' as defined in 
44 U.S.C. 3502(3).
    Identification and labeling requirements provide information to 
consumers and regulators needed to locate and recall noncomplying 
products. Identification and labeling requirements include content such 
as the name and address of the manufacturer. In addition, CSUs must 
contain warning labels. Warning labels or markings provide information 
to consumers on hazards and risks associated with product use. The CSU 
warning label must state: ``Children have died from furniture 
tipover.'' Section 10.2.3.1, ASTM F2057-23.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: CPSC estimates that approximately 
2,122 respondents will design and update the CSU label annually.\1\ 
CPSC estimates that there are approximately 20,103,360 CSU units that 
will need to be labeled annually.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ According to 2023 County Business Patterns data published by 
the U.S. Census Bureau there were between 2,075 and 3,955 
establishments manufacturing household furniture: Table CB2300CBP; 
Upper bound NAICS 33712 (Household and institutional furniture 
manufacturing), lower bound NAICS 337122 (Nonupholstered wood 
household furniture manufacturing).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Estimated Time per Response: The burden associated with the 
standard includes time spent updating/designing the labeling or marking 
for a CSU model and time spent attaching the label to a CSU. CPSC 
estimates that it could take an hour to update/design the labeling or 
marking for a CSU model. CPSC estimates it could take 0.06 minutes (3.6 
seconds or 1,000 labels per hour) to attach the label to the CSU.
    Total Estimated Annual Burden: CPSC estimates that it could take an 
hour to update/design the labeling or marking for a CSU model, 
therefore, the annual burden is 2,122 hours (based on 2,122 
respondents). CPSC estimates that attaching the label to CSUs would 
amount to an annual burden of 20,103 hours [(0.06 min x 20,103,360 
CSUs)/60 mins per hour]. The total estimated annual burden is 22,225 
hours.
    Total Estimated Annual Cost to Respondents: The total compensation 
cost per hour worked for private industry workers in goods-producing 
industries was $47.00 (March 2025, Table 4, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_06132025.pdf">https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_06132025.pdf</a>). Based on this analysis, CPSC 
estimates that the labor cost of respondent burden is approximately $1 
million annually [(2,122 hours + 20,103 hours) x $47.00 per hour = 
$1,044,575].
    In addition to the labor burden costs addressed above, the labeling 
requirement imposes additional annualized costs. These costs include 
capital costs for adhesive paper used for each label to be placed on 
the CSUs. CPSC estimates the cost of the printed label will be about 
$0.01. Therefore, the total cost of materials to industry would be 
about $200,000 per year ($0.01 x 20,103,360 units = $201,033.60).
    Request for Comments: The Commission solicits written comments from 
all interested persons about the proposed collection of information. 
The Commission specifically solicits information relevant to the 
following topics:
    <bullet> whether the collection of information described above is 
necessary for the proper performance of the Commission's functions, 
including whether the information would have practical utility;
    <bullet> whether the estimated burden of the proposed collection of 
information is accurate;
    <bullet> whether the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected could be enhanced; and
    <bullet> whether the burden imposed by the collection of 
information could be minimized by use of automated, electronic or other 
technological collection techniques, or other forms of information 
technology.

Alberta E. Mills,
Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission.
