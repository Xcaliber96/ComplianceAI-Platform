contact received about this NPRM.

Confidential Business Information

    CBI is commercial or financial information that is both customarily 
and actually treated as private by its owner. Under the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), CBI is exempt from public 
disclosure. If your comments responsive to this NPRM contain commercial 
or financial information that is customarily treated as private, that 
you actually treat as private, and that is relevant or responsive to 
this NPRM, it is important that you clearly designate the submitted 
comments as CBI. Please mark each page of your submission containing 
CBI as ``PROPIN.'' The FAA will treat such marked submissions as 
confidential under the FOIA, and they will not be placed in the public 
docket of this NPRM. Submissions containing CBI should be sent to Luis 
Cortez-Muniz, Aviation Safety Engineer, FAA, 2200 South 216th St., Des

Background

    The FAA has received reports of cracks in the bear strap at the 
forward upper corner of the forward galley door cutout on Model 737-
600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series (737NG) airplanes. A 
Boeing investigation determined that the cracks were caused by high 
operating stresses in the fuselage skin and bear strap due to stress 
concentration at the corner of the door cutout. Although no cracks have 
been reported in the same areas on Boeing 737 MAX airplanes, they have 
a similar design and build process, making those airplanes susceptible 
to the same crack condition. This condition, if not addressed may lead 
to the inability of a principal structural element to sustain limit 
loads and adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane.
    Boeing issued Alert Requirements Bulletin 737-53A1407 RB, dated 
December 20, 2022, to address the identified unsafe condition for Model 
737NG airplanes. Subsequently, the FAA issued AD 2024-06-01, Amendment 
39-22706 (89 FR 27376, April 17, 2024) to require an inspection of the 
fuselage skin and the bear strap at the forward galley door cutout 
forward upper corner for existing repairs, and applicable related 
investigative and corrective actions, as specified in Boeing Alert 
Requirements Bulletin 737-53A1407 RB, dated December 20, 2022.

FAA's Determination

    The FAA is issuing this NPRM after determining that the unsafe 
condition described previously is likely to exist or develop on other 
products of the same type design.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed Boeing Alert Requirements Bulletin 737-53A1408 RB, 
dated December 20, 2024. This material specifies procedures for an 
external general visual inspection of the fuselage skin for any repair 
and applicable on-condition actions. On-condition actions include 
repetitive detailed inspection for cracking of the fuselage skin; 
repetitive external surface high frequency eddy current (HFEC) 
inspections of the fuselage skin at certain fastener locations and the 
fuselage skin and bear strap along the edge of door corner radius for 
cracking; repetitive external subsurface low frequency eddy current 
(LFEC) inspection of the bear strap at certain fastener locations for 
cracking; and obtaining instructions from Boeing for alternative 
inspections or for crack repair.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Proposed AD Requirements in This NPRM

    This proposed AD would require accomplishing the actions specified 
in the material already described except for any differences identified 
as exceptions in the regulatory text of this proposed AD. For 
information on the procedures and compliance times, see this material 
at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under Docket No. FAA-2025-3985.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD, if adopted as proposed, would 
affect 471 airplanes of U.S. registry. The FAA estimates the following 
costs to comply with this proposed AD:

                                                 Estimated Costs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                    $340 per
                                    inspection cycle.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FAA has received no definitive data on which to base the cost 
estimates for the on-condition repairs or for the alternative 
inspections specified in this proposed AD.

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship 
between the national government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed 
regulation:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
