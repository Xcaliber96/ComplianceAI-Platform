SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Binational Panel AD/CVD Reviews Under the USMCA

    Article 10.12 of the USMCA provides that a party involved in an AD/
CVD proceeding may obtain review by a binational panel of a final AD/
CVD determination of one USMCA Party with respect to the products of 
another USMCA Party. Binational panels decide whether AD/CVD 
determinations are in accordance with the domestic laws of the 
importing USMCA Party using the standard of review that would have been 
applied by a domestic court of the importing USMCA Party. A panel may 
uphold the AD/CVD determination, or may remand it to the national 
administering authority for action not inconsistent with the panel's 
decision. Panel decisions may be reviewed in specific circumstances by 
a 3-member extraordinary challenge committee, selected from a separate 
roster composed of 15 current or former judges.
    Article 10.11 of the USMCA provides that a USMCA Party may refer an 
amendment to the AD/CVD statutes of another USMCA Party to a binational 
panel for a declaratory opinion as to whether the amendment is 
inconsistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 
the WTO Antidumping or Subsidies Agreements, successor agreements, or 
the object and purpose of the USMCA with regard to the establishment of 
fair and predictable conditions for the progressive liberalization of 
trade while maintaining effective and fair disciplines on unfair trade 
practices. If the panel finds that the amendment is inconsistent, the 
two USMCA Parties must consult and seek to achieve a mutually 
satisfactory solution.

B. Roster and Composition of Binational Panels

    Annex 10-B.1 of the USMCA provides for the maintenance of a roster 
of at least 75 individuals for service on Chapter 10 binational panels, 
with each USMCA Party selecting at least 25 individuals. A separate 
five-person panel is formed for each review of a final AD/CVD 
determination or statutory amendment. The majority of individuals on 
each panel must consist of lawyers in good standing, and the chair of 
the panel must be a lawyer.
    When there is a request to establish a panel, roster members from 
the two involved USMCA Parties will complete a disclosure form that is 
used to identify possible conflicts of interest or appearances thereof. 
The disclosure form requests information regarding

[[Page 53417]]

financial interests and affiliations, including information regarding 
the identity of clients of the roster member and, if applicable, 
clients of the roster member's firm.

C. Criteria for Eligibility for Inclusion on Roster

    The United States bases the selection of individuals for inclusion 
on the Chapter 10 roster on the eligibility criteria set out in Annex 
10-B.1 of the USMCA. Annex 10-B.1 provides that Chapter 10 roster 
members must be citizens of a USMCA Party, must be of good character 
and of high standing and repute, and are to be chosen strictly on the 
basis of their objectivity, reliability, sound judgment, and general 
familiarity with international trade law. Aside from judges, roster 
members may not be affiliated with the governments of any of the three 
USMCA Parties. Annex 10-B.1 also provides that, to the fullest extent 
practicable, the roster must include judges and former judges.

D. Adherence to the USMCA Code of Conduct for Binational Panelists

    The Code of Conduct under Chapter 10 and Chapter 31 (Dispute 
Settlement) (see <a href="https://can-mex-usa-sec.org/secretariat/agreement-accord-acuerdo/usmca-aceum-tmec/code-code-codigo.aspx?lang=eng">https://can-mex-usa-sec.org/secretariat/agreement-accord-acuerdo/usmca-aceum-tmec/code-code-codigo.aspx?lang=eng</a>), which 
was established pursuant to Article 10.17 of the USMCA, provides that 
current and former Chapter 10 roster members ``shall avoid impropriety 
and the appearance of impropriety and shall observe high standards of 
conduct so that the integrity and impartiality of the dispute 
settlement process is preserved.'' The Code of Conduct also provides 
that candidates who serve on Chapter 10 rosters, as well as those who 
ultimately are selected to serve as panelists, have an obligation to 
``disclose any interest, relationship or matter that is likely to 
affect [their] impartiality or independence, or that might reasonably 
create an appearance of impropriety or an apprehension of bias.'' Annex 
10-B.1 of the USMCA provides that roster members may engage in other 
business while serving as panelists, subject to the Code of Conduct and 
provided that such business does not interfere with the performance of 
the panelist's duties. In particular, Annex 10-B.1 states that 
``[w]hile acting as a panelist, a panelist may not appear as counsel 
before another panel.''

E. Procedures for Selection of Roster Members

    Section 412 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement 
Implementation Act (Pub. L. 116-113, 19 U.S.C. 4582) establishes 
procedures for the selection by USTR of the individuals chosen by the 
United States for inclusion on the Chapter 10 roster. The roster is 
renewed annually and applies during the one-year period beginning April 
1 of each calendar year.
    Under Section 412 of the Act, an interagency committee chaired by 
USTR prepares a preliminary list of candidates eligible for inclusion 
on the Chapter 10 roster. After consultation with the Senate Committee 
on Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means, the U.S. Trade 
Representative selects the final list of individuals chosen by the 
United States for inclusion on the Chapter 10 roster.
