Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

[Docket No. RM98-1-000]


Records Governing Off-the-Record Communications Public Notice

    This constitutes notice, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.2201(b), of 
the receipt of prohibited and exempt off-the-record communications.
    Order No. 607 (64 FR 51222, September 22, 1999) requires Commission 
decisional employees, who make or receive a prohibited or exempt off-
the-record communication relevant to the merits of a contested 
proceeding, to deliver to the Secretary of the Commission, a copy of 
the communication, if written, or a summary of the substance of any 
oral communication.
    Prohibited communications are included in a public, non-decisional 
file associated with, but not a part of, the

[[Page 53285]]

decisional record of the proceeding. Unless the Commission determines 
that the prohibited communication and any responses thereto should 
become a part of the decisional record, the prohibited off-the-record 
communication will not be considered by the Commission in reaching its 
decision. Parties to a proceeding may seek the opportunity to respond 
to any facts or contentions made in a prohibited off-the-record 
communication and may request that the Commission place the prohibited 
communication and responses thereto in the decisional record. The 
Commission will grant such a request only when it determines that 
fairness so requires. Any person identified below as having made a 
prohibited off-the-record communication shall serve the document on all 
parties listed on the official service list for the applicable 
proceeding in accordance with Rule 2010, 18 CFR 385.2010.
    Exempt off-the-record communications are included in the decisional 
record of the proceeding, unless the communication was with a 
cooperating agency as described by 40 CFR 1501.6, made under 18 CFR 
385.2201(e) (1) (v).
    The following is a list of off-the-record communications recently 
received by the Secretary of the Commission. Each filing may be viewed
