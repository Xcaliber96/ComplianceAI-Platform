Overview of This Information Collection

    Title: Drawback Process Regulations.
    OMB Number: 1651-0075.
    Form Number: 7553.
    Current Actions: Reinstatement without change to information 
collection.
    Type of Review: Reinstatement (without change).
    Affected Public: Businesses.
    Abstract: The collections of information related to the drawback 
process are required as per 19 CFR part 190 (Modernized Drawback), 
which provides for refunds of duties, taxes, and fees for certain 
merchandise that is imported into the United States where there is a 
subsequent related exportation or destruction. All claims for drawback, 
sometimes referred to as TFTEA-Drawback, must be filed electronically 
in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE), in accordance with the 
Trade Facilitation Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA) (Pub. L. 114-
125, 130 Stat. 122), and in compliance with the regulations in part 
190, 181 (NAFTA Drawback) and 182 (USMCA Drawback). Specific 
information on completing a claim is available in the drawback CBP and 
Trade Automated Interface Requirement (CATAIR) document at: <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/document/guidance/ace-drawback-catair-guidelines">https://www.cbp.gov/document/guidance/ace-drawback-catair-guidelines</a>.
    CBP Form 7553, Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy or Return 
Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback (NOI), documents both the 
exportation and destruction of merchandise eligible for drawback. The 
NOI is the official notification to CBP that an exportation or 
destruction will occur for drawback eligible merchandise. The CBP Form 
7553 has been updated to comply with TFTEA-Drawback requirements and is 
accessible at: <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/forms">http://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/forms</a>.
    Relevant Regulations and Statutes:
    Title 19, part 190--<a href="https://ecfr.io/Title-19/Part-190">https://ecfr.io/Title-19/Part-190</a> 19 U.S.C. 
1313 <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title19/pdf/USCODE-2011-title19-chap4-subtitleII-partI-sec1313.pdf">https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title19/pdf/USCODE-2011-title19-chap4-subtitleII-partI-sec1313.pdf</a>
    19 U.S.C. 1313 authorizes the information collected on the CBP form 
7553 as well as in the ACE system for the electronic drawback claim.
    This collection of information applies to the individuals and 
companies in the trade community who are and are not familiar with 
drawback, importing and exporting procedures, and with the CBP 
regulations.
    Please note that CBP Forms 7551 and 7552 are both abolished. From 
February 24, 2019, onward, TFTEA-Drawback, as provided for in part 190, 
is the only legal framework for filing drawback claims. No new drawback 
claims may be filed under the paper-based processes previously provided 
for in part 191 (Drawback). Sections 190.51, 190.52, and 190.53 provide 
the requirements to submit a drawback claim electronically. The 
provisions of part 190 are similar to the provisions in part 191, 
except where necessary to outline all the data elements for a complete 
claim (previously contained in CBP form 7551) and modify those 
requirements to comply with TFTEA-Drawback. CBP form 7552, Certificates 
of Delivery and Certificates of Manufacturing & Delivery will no longer 
be requested or accepted to demonstrate the transfer of merchandise. 
Sections 190.10 and 190.24 require that any transfers of merchandise 
must be evidenced by business records, as defined in section 190.2.
    Type of Information Collection: Form 7553.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 150.
    Estimated Number of Annual Responses per Respondent: 20.
    Estimated Number of Total Annual Responses: 3,000.
    Estimated Time per Response: 33 minutes.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 1,650.
