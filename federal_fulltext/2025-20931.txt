SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 14249, Protecting America's 
Bank Account Against Fraud, Waste, and Abuse, requires agencies to take 
action to defend against financial fraud and prevent improper payments 
in collaboration with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. To assist 
SSA in administering the Social Security Act, we are adding the 
following routine use to the systems of records listed below to permit 
disclosure to Department of Treasury to review SSA's payment and award 
eligibility through the Do Not Pay Working System for the purpose of 
identifying, preventing, or recouping fraud and improper payments when 
disclosure meets the requirements in 20 CFR 401.150(c):

    To the U.S. Department of the Treasury, when disclosure of the 
information is relevant to review SSA's payment and award 
eligibility through the Do Not Pay Working System for the purposes 
of identifying, preventing or recouping improper payments to an 
applicant for, or recipient of, Federal funds disbursed by a state 
(meaning a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, a 
territory or possession of the United States, or a federally-
recognized Indian tribe) in a state-administered, federally-funded 
program. This routine use will be applied when disclosure meets the 
requirements in 20 CFR 401.150(c).
