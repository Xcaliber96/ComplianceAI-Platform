[Docket No. FWS-R8-ES-2025-0143; FXES11140800000-256-FF08EVEN00]


Receipt of Incidental Take Permit Application and Draft Habitat 
Conservation Plan and Draft Environmental Assessment for the California 
Department of Parks and Recreation, Oceano Dunes District, San Luis 
Obispo County, California

AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

ACTION: Notice of availability; request for comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the 
receipt of an application from California Department of Parks and 
Recreation (CDPR; applicant) for an incidental take permit (ITP) under 
the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The applicant requests the ITP to 
take federally listed species incidental to lawful activities at Pismo 
State Beach and Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area, San Luis 
Obispo County, California. The activities are described in the draft 
habitat conservation plan (HCP) and associated draft environmental 
assessment (EA) for CDPR activities. The CDPR developed the draft HCP 
as part of their application for an ITP. The Service prepared a draft 
EA in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to 
evaluate the potential effects to the natural and human environment 
resulting from issuing an ITP to CDPR. We are providing notice that the 
draft HCP and draft EA are both available for public review. We invite 
comment on these documents from the public and local, State, Tribal, 
and Federal agencies.

DATES: Please submit written comments on or before January 23, 2026.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
(Service), announce the receipt of an application from the CDPR for an 
ITP under the Endangered Species Act 1973, as amended (ESA; 16 U.S.C. 
1531 et seq.). The applicant requests the ITP to take federally listed 
species incidental to CDPR's public use, recreation management, natural 
resources management, and park and beach management activities on 5,005 
acres of Pismo State Beach and Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation 
Area, in San Luis Obispo County, California. The CDPR developed the 
draft HCP as part of its application for an ITP under the ESA. The 
Service prepared a draft EA in accordance with NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
seq.) to evaluate the potential effects to the natural and human 
environment resulting from issuing an ITP to CDPR. We invite public 
comment on these documents.

Draft HCP Covered Species

    The CDPR has developed a draft HCP that includes measures to 
mitigate and minimize impacts to the following 10 covered species and 2 
proposed listed species:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Species                                            Listing information

    California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii).  May 23, 1996 (61 FR 25813).
State Listed as Threatened:
    Surf thistle (Cirsium rhothophilum).........  1990.
    Beach spectaclepod (Dithyrea maritima)......  1990.
Proposed federal listing
    Southwestern pond turtle (Actinemys pallida)  2023 (88 FR 68370).
    Western spadefoot (Spea hammondii)..........  2023 (88 FR 84252).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The ITP would authorize take of the four animal species (California 
least tern, tidewater goby, western snowy plover, and California red-
legged frog) incidental to otherwise lawful activities associated with 
the HCP-covered activities. The draft HCP also includes minimization 
measures to reduce impacts on the two animal species that have been 
proposed for listing. In the event these animals become listed, the ITP 
will be amended to authorize the take of these species as outlined in 
the HCP.

Background

    Section 9 of the ESA prohibits the take of fish or wildlife species 
listed as endangered. As applicable to the species affected by the 
proposed action, the ESA implementing regulations also prohibit take of 
fish or wildlife species listed as threatened. ``Take'' is defined 
under the ESA to include the following activities: ``[T]o harass, harm, 
pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to 
attempt to engage in any such

[[Page 52994]]

conduct'' (16 U.S.C. 1532); however, under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the 
ESA, we may issue permits to authorize incidental take of listed 
species. ``Incidental take'' is defined by the ESA as take that is 
incidental to, and not the purpose of, carrying out of an otherwise 
lawful activity. Regulations governing incidental take permits for 
threatened and endangered species are in the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) at 50 CFR 17.32 and 17.22, respectively. Under the 
ESA, protections for federally listed plants differ from the 
protections afforded to federally listed animals. Issuance of an 
incidental take permit also must not jeopardize the existence of 
federally listed fish, wildlife, or plant species. The permittees would 
receive assurances under our ``No Surprises'' regulations (50 CFR 
17.22(b)(5) and 17.32(b)(5)) regarding conservation activities for the 
covered species.

Proposed Activities

    The CDPR has applied for an ITP that would authorize incidental 
take of the four covered animal species that could result from covered 
activities described in the HCP. The covered area comprises 5,005 acres 
of Pismo State Beach and Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area. 
The covered area includes designated critical habitat for the western 
snowy plover, tidewater goby, and La Graciosa thistle. The HCP 
describes measures CDPR will implement to avoid and minimize impacts 
and take of the covered species. Mitigation for unavoidable take would 
be accomplished through CDPR's existing conservation program and 
through meeting the biological goals and objectives outlined in the 
HCP. The conservation program is designed to protect and promote 
recovery of covered species, including managing habitat components to 
benefit covered species, minimizing human alteration or disturbance of 
native habitats, reducing conflicts between covered species and park 
users, restoring native habitats, and monitoring the success of these 
efforts.

Alternatives

    We are considering four alternatives in the draft EA:
    (1) The no action alternative, which would not result in issuance 
of an ITP for ongoing activities;
    (2) The proposed action would be issuance of an ITP based on the 
activities described in draft HCP, including reduction of the existing 
protected area boundary (``southern exclosure'') for the California 
least tern and western snowy plover if the species' meet biological 
targets;
    (3) Issuance of an ITP based on the draft HCP maintaining the 
existing ``southern exclosure'' boundary; and
    (4) Issuance of an ITP based on the draft HCP with year-round 
exclosures.

Public Availability of Comments

    Before including your address, phone number, email address, or 
other personal identifying information in your comment, be aware that 
your entire comment, including your personal identifying information, 
may be made publicly available at any time. While you can ask us in 
your comment to withhold your personal identifying information from 
public view, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so.

Next Steps

    The Service will evaluate the application and the comments received 
to determine whether to issue the requested ITP. We will also conduct 
an intra-Service consultation pursuant to section 7 of the ESA to 
evaluate the effects of the proposed take. After considering the 
preceding and other matters, we will determine whether the permit 
issuance criteria of section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA have been met. If 
met, the Service will issue an ITP to the applicant.

Authority

    We provide this notice under section 10(c) of the Endangered 
Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and its implementing regulations 
(50 CFR 17.22 and 50 CFR 17.32), and NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).
