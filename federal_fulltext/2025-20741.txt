SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    Draft FAA Order 8000.95D, Change 1, Designee Management Policy 
(Draft Change 1) would transition from the Designee Registration System 
to the Designee Management System (DMS) and would align the Order 
8000.95 with the DMS tool workflows. The revisions would align designee 
training procedures with the new features of the DMS tool. Draft Change 
1 would revise Volume 3, Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE), Specialty 
Aircraft Examiner (SAE), and Administrative Pilot Examiner (Admin PE) 
Designee Policy to update the documentation of training, require 
designees to submit training certificates through DMS, and establish 
suspension protocols for incomplete training, while clarifying training 
terminology and categories. Draft Change 1 would update the web link 
for the training matrix in Volume 4, Designated Aircraft Dispatcher 
Examiner (DADE) Designee Policy. In Volume 5, Designated Mechanic 
Examiner (DME), Designated Parachute Rigger Examiner (DPRE), and 
Designated Airworthiness Representative--Maintenance (DAR-T) Designee 
Policy, Draft Change 1 would move training processes to the DMS system, 
automating updates to training records and streamlining scheduling and 
completion with automatic suspension and reinstatement for training 
compliance. Draft Change 1 would revise Volumes 3 (DPE, SAE and Admin 
PE Designee Policy), 5 (DME, DPRE, DAR-T Designee Policy), 6 (Aircrew 
Program Designee (APD)) Designee Policy, and 7 (Training Center 
Evaluator (TCE) Designee Policy) to change how direct observation 
oversight intervals are determined. In Volume 8, Designated 
Manufacturing Inspection Representative (DMIR) and Designated 
Airworthiness Representative--Manufacturing (DAR-F) Designee Policy, 
Draft Change 1 would revise training procedures to align with DMS 
workflows and standards for course information, registration, and 
automatic suspension and reinstatement for training compliance. In 
Volume 9, Designated Engineering Representative (DER) Designee Policy, 
Draft Change 1 would revise web links and sections related to 
engineering designee training for clarity and accuracy. In Volume 10, 
Designated Control Tower Operator Examiner (DCTO-E) Designee Policy, 
Draft Change 1 would update the requirements for demonstrated history 
of professional performance and established compliance with applicable 
standards, and would add an overall performance results table.
    In addition to Draft Change 1's proposed changes to designee 
training and direct observation oversight intervals, other changes 
would include updating email addresses and website links, establishing 
digital signature provisions, providing early preapprovals to improve 
process efficiency, and removing outdated references to streamline the 
documentation.
    Draft Order 8000.95D, Change 1 would affect all individual designee 
types. You may examine draft Order 8000.95D, Change 1 and the preferred
