14 CFR Part 39

[Docket No. FAA-2024-1895; Project Identifier MCAI-2023-01240-T; 
Amendment 39-23168; AD 2025-20-15]
RIN 2120-AA64


Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-08-
08, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; 
Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; 
Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and 
Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. 
AD 2022-08-08 required repetitive special detailed inspections of 
certain double joggle areas on the fuselage and applicable on-condition 
actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-08-08, it was determined that 
additional airplane models are subject to the unsafe condition and 
additional requirements are necessary for airplanes repaired after 
accomplishment of certain airworthiness limitations item (ALI) tasks. 
This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-08-08. This AD also 
adds airplane models to the applicability and additional requirements 
for certain airplanes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe 
condition on these products.

DATES: This AD is effective January 2, 2026. The Director of the 
Federal Register approved the incorporation by reference of a certain 
publication listed in this AD as of January 2, 2026.

ADDRESSES: 
    AD Docket: You may examine the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 
CFR part 39 to supersede AD 2022-08-08, Amendment 39-22011 (87 FR 
23755, April 21, 2022) (AD 2022-08-08). AD 2022-08-08 applied to 
certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -
113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, 
-214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -
131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2022-08-08 required 
repetitive special detailed inspections of certain areas and applicable 
on-condition actions. The FAA issued AD 2022-08-08 to address cracks in 
the double joggle areas at frame (FR) 16 and FR20, right-hand and left-
hand sides, which, if not detected and corrected, could reduce the 
structural integrity of the fuselage.
    The NPRM was published in the Federal Register on July 24, 2024 (89 
FR 59857). The NPRM was prompted by AD 2023-0212, dated December 6, 
2023

[[Page 54569]]

(EASA AD 2023-0212), issued by EASA, which is the Technical Agent for 
the Member States of the European Union. EASA AD 2023-0212 states that 
the unsafe condition may also exist on Airbus SAS A318/A320/A321 
``NEO'' airplanes (i.e., Airbus SAS Model A318-151N, -153N, and -171N; 
A320-251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N; and A321-251N, -
251NX, -252N, -252NX, -253N, -253NX, -271N, -271NX, -272N, and -272NX 
airplanes), so these airplanes are added to the applicability. In 
addition, Airbus has developed additional, new structural repair manual 
(SRM) tasks that are considered additional alternative methods to the 
Airbus repair designs originally required by EASA AD 2021-0227, dated 
October 11, 2021, for the airplanes affected by that AD.
    In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to continue to require the actions in 
AD 2022-08-08 and add NEO airplane models to the applicability, as 
specified in EASA AD 2023-0212.
    The FAA issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) 
to amend 14 CFR part 39 to supersede AD 2022-08-08. The SNPRM was 
published in the Federal Register on February 18, 2025 (90 FR 9695). 
The SNPRM was prompted EASA AD 2024-0217, dated November 18, 2024 (EASA 
AD 2024-0217) (also referred to as ``the MCAI''), which superseded EASA 
AD 2023-0212. Since EASA AD 2023-0212 was issued, it was determined 
that AD-mandated repetitive inspections were incorrectly terminated for 
all the Airbus repair instructions; only those in which the termination 
of the AD-mandated inspections was explicitly written in the Airbus-
approved instructions should have been terminated. Therefore, 
additional requirements are necessary for airplanes that have been 
repaired after accomplishment of ALI tasks 531153-02 or 531155-02.
    In the SNPRM, the FAA revised the NPRM by adding additional 
requirements for airplanes that have been repaired after accomplishment 
of ALI task 531153-02 or 531155-02. The FAA is issuing this AD to 
address the unsafe condition on these products.
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2024-1895.

Discussion of Final Airworthiness Directive

Comments

    The FAA received comments from an individual who supported the 
SNPRM without change.
    The FAA received additional comments from Delta Air Lines (Delta) 
and an individual. The following presents the comment received on the 
SNPRM and the FAA's response.

Request To Require Inspections Be Completed by the FAA

    An individual requested that the FAA be required to inspect all 
affected airplanes to determine if there is significant damage. The 
individual also requested that any safety requirements of the proposed 
AD be repaired before further flight.
    The FAA agrees to clarify. The actions required by this AD are the 
responsibility of operators. FAA regulations (14 CFR 43.3) stipulate 
who can perform maintenance on or alter an airplane on the U.S. 
registry, including inspections required by an AD. AD actions must be 
performed by people holding certain certificates or having specialized 
training that provides them the knowledge necessary to properly inspect 
and repair airplanes. In addition, this AD requires operators to 
address any cracks that are detected before further flight. The FAA has 
not revised the AD in this regard.

Request To Terminate Certain SRM Inspections

    Delta requested that the FAA add an exception to paragraph (h) of 
the proposed AD to specify that the repetitive inspections in paragraph 
(1) of EASA AD 2024-0217 supersede the repetitive inspections in SRM 
task 53-11-12-205-008 or 53-11-12-205-007, as applicable. Delta stated 
that, if cracking is found, two of the service bulletins referenced in 
the Corrective Action(s) paragraph of EASA AD 2024-0217 specify to 
repair using SRM task 53-11-12-300-012 or 53-11-12-300-013, which in 
turn specify doing repetitive inspections per SRM task 53-11-12-205-008 
or SRM task 53-11-12-205-007, respectively. Delta also stated that SRM 
tasks 53-11-12-205-008 and SRM task 53-11-12-205-007 do not specify 
that these repetitive inspections supersede, replace, or terminate the 
repetitive inspections in paragraph (1) of EASA AD 2024-0217. Delta 
asserted this results in duplicative repetitive inspections of the same 
area at different compliance times since accomplishing the corrective 
action also does not terminate the repetitive inspections in paragraph 
(1) of EASA AD 2024-0217.
    The FAA agrees that the AD is not intended to require duplicative 
repetitive inspections. However, the FAA has determined that an 
exception is not necessary. This AD only requires the repetitive 
inspections to be done in accordance with paragraph (1) of the EASA AD 
except as specified in paragraph (7) of EASA AD 2024-0217. The 
provision in paragraph (7) of EASA 2024-0217 specifies ``unless 
specified otherwise in the instructions provided by Airbus'', which 
applies to the statement in the material referenced in paragraph (1) of 
EASA AD 2024-0217 that states to repeat the inspection for the non-
repaired hole(s). Therefore, paragraph (1) of EASA AD 2024-0217 does 
not require repetitive inspections of repaired holes at those 
locations. However, the repetitive post-repair inspections referenced 
in SRM tasks 53-11-12-205-008 and 53-11-12-205-007 may be required for 
compliance with paragraph (2) of EASA AD 2024-0217. The FAA has not 
revised the AD in this regard.

Additional Changes Made to This AD

    In the SNPRM, the FAA stated that accomplishing the required 
actions would terminate ALI tasks 531153-02-1, 531153-02-2, 531155-02-
1, and 531155-02-2, as required by paragraph (o) of AD 2023-13-10, 
Amendment 39-22495 (88 FR 50005, August 1, 2023) (AD 2023-13-10). AD 
2023-13-10 has since been superseded by AD 2025-03-06, Amendment 39-
22954 (90 FR 9595, February 14, 2025) (AD 2025-03-06). The service 
information referenced in AD 2025-03-06 revises ALI tasks 531153-02-1 
and 531155-02-1 and deletes ALI tasks 531153-02-2 and 531155-02-2. The 
FAA has therefore revised paragraph (b)(2) of this AD to specify that 
it affects AD 2025-03-06 and revised paragraph (j) of this AD to 
specify that accomplishing the actions required by this AD terminates 
ALI tasks 531153-02-1 and 531155-02-1 as required by paragraph (n) of 
AD 2025-03-06.
    Additionally, in the SNPRM the FAA inadvertently omitted an 
exception to require using the effective date of this AD in lieu of the 
effective date of EASA AD 2024-0217. The FAA has added paragraph (h)(4) 
of this AD to include this exception.

Conclusion

    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority 
of another country and are approved for operation in the United States. 
Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design 
Authority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant 
data, considered any comments received, and determined that air safety 
requires adopting this AD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing 
this AD to address the unsafe condition on this product. Except for

[[Page 54570]]

minor editorial changes, and any other changes described previously, 
this AD is adopted as proposed in the SNPRM. None of the changes will 
increase the economic burden on any operator.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2024-0217, which specifies procedures for 
repetitive special detailed inspections for cracking of double joggle 
areas at FR16 and FR20, right-hand and left-hand sides, applicable on-
condition actions (repair), and an optional modification of the double 
joggle area that terminates the repetitive inspections. The 
modification includes a rotating probe inspection of certain fastener 
holes for cracks, a check of the fastener holes for a minimum diameter, 
and applicable on-condition actions. EASA AD 2024-0217 also specifies 
that new SRM tasks have been developed that are acceptable for 
compliance with the corrective actions required by AD 2022-08-08 for 
airplanes affected by that AD. EASA AD 2024-0217 specifies additional 
requirements for airplanes that have been repaired after accomplishment 
of ALI task 531153-02 or 531155-02.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 1,755 airplanes of U.S. 
registry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:

                                      Estimated Costs for Required Actions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Labor cost               Parts cost        Cost per product             Cost on U.S. operators
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Up to 55 work-hours x $85 per hour            $0  Up to $4,675................  Up to $8,204,625.
 = Up to $4,675.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                  Estimated Costs for Optional Actions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Labor cost                Parts cost     Cost per product
------------------------------------------------------------------------
60 work-hours x $85 per hour = $5,100       $1,624               $6,724
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FAA has received no definitive data on which to base the cost 
estimates for the on-condition repairs specified in this AD.

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, 
on the relationship between the national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various 
levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 (e) Unsafe Condition

    This AD was prompted by reports that, during inspections 
accomplished as specified in certain airworthiness limitation items 
(ALIs), cracks were detected in the double joggle areas at frame 
(FR) 16 and FR20 in the nose forward fuselage. The unsafe condition, 
if not addressed, could result in reduced structural integrity of 
the fuselage.

 (f) Compliance

    Comply with this AD within the compliance times specified, 
unless already done.

 (g) Requirements

    Except as specified in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this AD: Comply 
with all required actions and compliance times specified in, and in 
accordance with, EASA AD 2024-0217.

 (h) Exceptions to EASA AD 2024-0217

    (1) Replace paragraph (3) of EASA AD 2024-0217 with ``For an 
airplane that has been repaired before the effective date of this AD 
in an affected area using Airbus-approved instructions unrelated to 
(not a result of a finding during an ALI inspection or the 
inspection SB) ALI task 531153-02-1, 531153-02-2, 531155-02-1, 
531155-02-2, 531153-03-1, 531155-03-1 or the inspection SB, as 
applicable: Before exceeding the thresholds as specified in Table 1

applicable, contact the Manager, AIR-520, Continued Operational 
Safety Branch, FAA; or EASA; or Airbus SAS's EASA Design 
Organization Approval (DOA)s for approved instructions and 
accomplish those instructions accordingly. If approved by the DOA, 
the approval must include the DOA-authorized signature.''
    (2) Where paragraph (4) of EASA AD 2024-0217 specifies to 
``contact Airbus for approved repair instructions and, within the 
compliance time specified therein, accomplish those instructions 
accordingly'' if any cracks are detected, for this AD if any 
cracking is detected, the cracking must be repaired before further 
flight using a method approved by the Manager, AIR-520, Continued 
Operational Safety Branch, FAA; or EASA; or Airbus SAS's EASA Design 
Organization Approval (DOA). If approved by the DOA, the approval 
must include the DOA-authorized signature.
    (3) This AD does not adopt the ``Remarks'' section of EASA AD 
2024-0217.
    (4) Where EASA AD 2024-0217 refers to its effective date, this 
AD requires using the effective date of this AD.

 (i) No Reporting Requirement

    Although the service information referenced in EASA AD 2024-0217 
specifies to submit certain information to the manufacturer, this AD 
does not include that requirement.

 (j) Terminating Action for Certain Requirements in AD 2025-03-06

    Accomplishing the actions required by this AD terminates ALI 
tasks 531153-02-1, and 531155-02-1 as required by paragraph (n) of 
AD 2025-03-06 only for the airplanes identified in paragraph (c) of 
this AD.

 (k) Additional AD Provisions

    The following provisions also apply to this AD:
    (1) Alternative Methods of Compliance (AMOCs): The Manager, AIR-
520, Continued Operational Safety Branch, FAA, has the authority to 
approve AMOCs for this AD, if requested using the procedures found 
in 14 CFR 39.19. In accordance with 14 CFR 39.19, send your request 
to your principal inspector or responsible Flight Standards Office, 
as appropriate. If sending information directly to the manager of 
the Continued Operational Safety Branch, mail it to the address 
identified in paragraph (l) of this AD. Information may be emailed 
to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5f1e12101c1f393e3e71383029"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0c4d41434f4c6a6d6d226b637a">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
    (i) Before using any approved AMOC, notify your appropriate 
principal inspector, or lacking a principal inspector, the manager 
of the responsible Flight Standards Office.
    (ii) AMOCs approved previously for AD 2022-08-08 are approved as 
AMOCs for the corresponding provisions of EASA AD 2024-0217 that are 
required by paragraph (g) of this AD.
    (2) Contacting the Manufacturer: For any requirement in this AD 
to obtain instructions from a manufacturer, the instructions must be 
accomplished using a method approved by the Manager, AIR-520, 
Continued Operational Safety Branch, FAA; or EASA; or Airbus SAS's 
EASA DOA. If approved by the DOA, the approval must include the DOA-
authorized signature.
    (3) Required for Compliance (RC): Except as required by 
paragraphs (h)(2) and (k)(2) of this AD, if any material contains 
procedures or tests that are identified as RC, those procedures and 
tests must be done to comply with this AD; any procedures or tests 
that are not identified as RC are recommended. Those procedures and 
tests that are not identified as RC may be deviated from using 
accepted methods in accordance with the operator's maintenance or 
inspection program without obtaining approval of an AMOC, provided 
the procedures and tests identified as RC can be done and the 
airplane can be put back in an airworthy condition. Any 
substitutions or changes to procedures or tests identified as RC 
require approval of an AMOC.

 (l) Additional Information
