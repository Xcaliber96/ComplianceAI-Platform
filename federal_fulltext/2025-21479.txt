Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all 
Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by 
reports of mechanical noises originating from the nose landing gear 
(NLG) shock absorber during ground maneuvers. This AD requires 
repetitive inspections (i.e., steering checks) of the NLG shock 
absorber and applicable on-condition actions. This AD also limits the 
installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is 
issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

DATES: This AD is effective January 2, 2026.
    The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by 
reference of a certain publication listed in this AD as of January 2, 
2026.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 
CFR part 39 by adding an AD that would apply to all Airbus SAS Model 
A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. The NPRM was published in the Federal 
Register on May 21, 2025 (90 FR 21702). The NPRM was prompted by AD 
2025-0093, dated April 24, 2025 (EASA AD 2025-0093) (also referred to 
as the MCAI), issued by EASA, which is the Technical Agent for the 
Member States of the European Union. The MCAI reports instances of 
mechanical noises originating from the NLG shock absorber during ground 
maneuvers. Further analysis traced these noises to higher than expected 
friction between the lower bearing carrier (LBC) and the main fitting 
of the sliding tube. This friction may cause deformation of the LBC's 
anti-rotation tabs, leading to relative movement between the LBC and 
the main fitting. As a result, wear on the corrosion protection coating 
of the main fitting may occur due to subsequent movement of the 
retainer ring positioned between these components, which could lead to 
corrosion of the NLG main fitting.
    In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to require repetitive inspections 
(i.e., steering checks) of the NLG shock absorber and applicable on-
condition actions and limit the installation of affected parts under 
certain conditions, as specified in EASA AD 2025-0093. The FAA is 
issuing this AD to address higher than expected friction on the NLG 
shock absorber LBC, which could result in deformation of the LBC's 
anti-rotation tabs and consequent corrosion of the NLG main fitting. 
The unsafe condition, if not addressed, could lead to structural 
failure of the NLG, which may result in damage to the airplane and 
injury to occupants.
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2025-0912.

Discussion of Final Airworthiness Directive

Comments

    The FAA received a comment from the Air Line Pilots Association, 
International (ALPA) who supported the NPRM without change.
    The FAA received additional comments from Delta Air Lines (Delta). 
The following presents those comments and the FAA's responses.

Request To Clarify if a Certain Service Bulletin Provides Terminating 
Action

    Delta requested the FAA clarify whether modifications performed 
using Liebherr Service Bulletin 6407A-32-01, dated May 27, 2025, and 
any future service bulletin modifications may be used as terminating 
action for the requirements of the proposed AD. Delta noted that the 
Liebherr service bulletin provides instructions for modifying certain 
affected parts to not affected parts, which effectively changes a Group 
1 or 3 airplane to a Group 4 airplane. Delta noted that EASA AD 2025-
0093 specifies Group 4 airplanes are only subject to the parts 
prohibition requirement. Delta asserted that the intent of the affected 
part, not affected part, and group definitions is to allow retrofit of 
an airplane to become a Group 4 airplane once a modification is 
developed, such as the one in the Liebherr service bulletin. Delta also 
asked whether other methods, such as other Airbus service bulletins or 
replacement of a NLG assembly with one that does not have affected 
parts installed, could similarly be used to convert a Groups 1 through 
3 airplane to a Group 4 airplane.
    The FAA acknowledges that if an ``Affected part'' is replaced with 
a ``Not affected part,'' then the airplane would become a Group 4 
airplane per the definitions in EASA AD 2025-0093 and the repetitive 
checks and reporting would no longer need to be accomplished for that 
airplane. However, the FAA has not received or reviewed Liebherr 
Service Bulletin 6407A-32-01 to determine if accomplishing the 
modification in that service bulletin is acceptable as a terminating 
action for the repetitive checks and reporting required by this AD. 
Further, the FAA has not received, reviewed, or approved any other 
service information that would potentially provide a terminating 
action. Therefore, the FAA declines to revise this AD to allow the 
Liebherr service bulletin as a terminating action. However, under the 
provisions of paragraph (i)(1) of this AD, an operator may propose 
terminating action as an alternative method of compliance (AMOC) for 
the requirements of this AD. If sufficient substantiating data is 
provided and an equivalent level of safety is demonstrated, the FAA may 
approve such AMOC requests to allow for

[[Page 54550]]

termination of the required actions in this AD. The FAA has not changed 
the AD in response to this comment.

Request To Remove Reporting Requirement

    Delta requested the FAA add a paragraph to the proposed AD stating 
that the reporting requirement specified in paragraph (5) of EASA AD 
2025-0093 is not adopted. Delta reasoned that reporting is not 
necessary since Airbus does not need to collect additional data to 
determine the root cause or final solution because EASA AD 2025-0093 
already identifies a final solution in the ``Not affected part'' 
definition; and that such parts can be installed in service using 
Liebherr Service Bulletin 6407A-32-01, dated May 27, 2025. Delta also 
reasoned reporting is not necessary because there is no list of bad 
serial numbers, so Airbus does not need to maintain a bad parts pool. 
Delta concluded that, while Airbus may want operators to continue 
reporting to assist with tracking spare parts, the reporting 
requirement does not appear to contribute to an enhanced level of 
safety.
    The FAA disagrees with removing the reporting requirement from this 
AD. The FAA notes that reporting is required only if there is a 
discrepancy as specified in paragraph (5) of EASA AD 2025-0093. 
Although the EASA AD identifies ``not affected'' parts, the EASA AD 
does not indicate that a final fix or permanent solution has been 
developed. Further, the FAA has received no information indicating that 
Airbus has established a terminating action at this time. Therefore, 
the FAA considers the reporting requirement necessary to continue 
gathering data relevant to the unsafe condition. However, the FAA has 
added a new paragraph (h)(4) to this AD to provide a 30-day grace 
period for operators who may have accomplished the steering check 
before the effective date of the AD.

Request To Clarify Which Instructions Are Required for Compliance

    Delta requested the FAA clarify which portions of Airbus Alert 
Operators Transmission (AOT) A32P031-24, Revision 04, dated March 11, 
2025, are required for compliance with the proposed AD. Delta noted the 
AOT indicates section 5.6, including the flowchart, is labeled as 
required for compliance (RC). Delta also noted EASA AD 2025-0093 
specifies accomplishing a steering check of the affected part and 
applicable corrective actions in accordance with the instructions of 
the AOT. Delta interprets this to mean that only the portions of the 
AOT related to the steering check and corrective actions are required. 
Delta expressed concern with the first question in the flowchart, which 
asks whether the NLG secondary seal was activated before installation. 
Delta stated this question cannot reliably be answered because the 
mechanic inspecting the NLG will have no knowledge, and there might be 
no maintenance record, of why the seal was changed. Delta asserted 
that, if the flowchart is required, the AOT should include a procedure 
for this question to determine why the seal was changed. Delta also 
expressed concern with the instruction in the flowchart to replace the 
NLG shock absorber dynamic seals per a certain maintenance plan task 
within the compliance time of the AOT. Delta asserted that the AOT does 
not specify the compliance time for this action. Delta stated that if 
the flowchart is RC, then the proposed AD should be revised to include 
a procedure to determine why the secondary seal was activated and a 
compliance time for replacement of the NLG shock absorber dynamic 
seals.
    The FAA notes that the flowchart in section 5.6 of the AOT is RC. 
Paragraph (g) of this AD mandates compliance with all required actions 
and compliance times specified in, and in accordance with, the EASA AD, 
which in turn references the AOT. Therefore, all sections of the AOT 
that are labeled as RC, including the flowchart in section 5.6, are 
required for compliance with this AD.
    The FAA acknowledges the commenter's concern about assessing the 
cause of secondary seal activation but disagrees with revising this AD 
to add a procedure to address it. The FAA considers it reasonable to 
expect operators to determine, through maintenance record review, 
whether the activation was due to primary seal leakage or another 
reason. The FAA notes that operators are required to maintain adequate 
records (per 14 CFR 91.417) to make such determinations and apply the 
flowchart accordingly.
    Regarding the compliance time in the flowchart related to 
replacement of the NLG shock absorber dynamic seals, the compliance 
times specified in this AD take precedence. Specifically, the dynamic 
seal replacement must be completed within the compliance time 
established for the initial steering check. The FAA has not changed the 
AD in this regard.

Conclusion

    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority 
of another country and are approved for operation in the United States. 
Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design 
Authority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant 
data, considered any comments received, and determined that air safety 
requires adopting this AD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing 
this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Except for 
minor editorial changes, this AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. 
None of the changes will increase the economic burden on any operator.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2025-0093, which specifies procedures for 
repetitive inspections (i.e., steering checks) for relative movement 
between the LBC and the main fitting and applicable on-condition 
actions. The on-condition actions include activating the secondary 
seal, inspecting and applying torque to the nose landing gear seal 
changeover valve, inspecting the ring groove for corrosion, and 
repairing any corrosion. EASA AD 2025-0093 also specifies reporting the 
results of each check where a discrepancy was identified to the 
manufacturer and limits the installation of affected parts, for 
airplanes with an affected part installed, unless the steering check 
has been completed. For airplanes that do not have an affected part 
installed, EASA AD 2025-0093 prohibits installing an affected part.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Interim Action

    The FAA considers this AD an interim action. If final action is 
later identified, the FAA might consider further rulemaking then.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 33 airplanes of U.S. 
registry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:

Paperwork Reduction Act

    A federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to, nor shall a person be subject to a penalty for 
failure to comply with a collection of information subject to the 
requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act unless that collection of 
information displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. The OMB 
Control Number for this information collection is 2120-0056. Public 
reporting for this collection of information is estimated to take 
approximately 1 hour per response, including the time for reviewing 
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and 
maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the 
collection of information. All responses to this collection of 
information are mandatory. Send comments regarding this burden estimate 
or any other aspect of this collection of information, including 
suggestions for reducing this burden, to: Information Collection 
Clearance Officer, Federal Aviation Administration, 10101 Hillwood

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, 
on the relationship between the national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various 
levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

this AD: Submit the report within 30 days after the effective date 
of this AD.
    (5) This AD does not adopt the ``Remarks'' section of EASA AD 
2025-0093.

 (i) Additional AD Provisions

    The following provisions also apply to this AD:
    (1) Alternative Methods of Compliance (AMOCs): The Manager, AIR-
520, Continued Operational Safety Branch, FAA, has the authority to 
approve AMOCs for this AD, if requested using the procedures found 
in 14 CFR 39.19. In accordance with 14 CFR 39.19, send your request 
to your principal inspector or responsible Flight Standards Office, 
as appropriate. If sending information directly to the manager of 
the Continued Operational Safety Branch, send it to the attention of 
the person identified in paragraph (j) of this AD and email to: 
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bafbf7f5f9fadcdbdb94ddd5cc"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6524282a26250304044b020a13">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Before using any approved AMOC, notify your 
appropriate principal inspector, or lacking a principal inspector, 
the manager of the responsible Flight Standards Office.
    (2) Contacting the Manufacturer: For any requirement in this AD 
to obtain instructions from a manufacturer, the instructions must be 
accomplished using a method approved by the Manager, Continued 
Operational Safety Branch, FAA; or EASA; or Airbus SAS's EASA Design 
Organization Approval (DOA). If approved by the DOA, the approval 
must include the DOA-authorized signature.
    (3) Required for Compliance (RC): Except as required by 
paragraph (i)(2) of this AD, if any material referenced in EASA AD 
2025-0093 contains paragraphs that are labeled as RC, the 
instructions in RC paragraphs, including subparagraphs under an RC 
paragraph, must be done to comply with this AD; any paragraphs, 
including subparagraphs under those paragraphs, that are not 
identified as RC are recommended. The instructions in paragraphs, 
including subparagraphs under those paragraphs, not identified as RC 
may be deviated from using accepted methods in accordance with the 
operator's maintenance or inspection program without obtaining 
approval of an AMOC, provided the instructions identified as RC can 
be done and the airplane can be put back in an airworthy condition. 
Any substitutions or changes to instructions identified as RC 
require approval of an AMOC.
