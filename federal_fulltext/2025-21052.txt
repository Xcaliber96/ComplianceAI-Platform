    k. This application has been accepted and is ready for

    l. The existing Felt Project consists of: (1) a 122.5-foot-long, 
12-foot-high concrete dam that includes the following sections: (a) 25-
foot-wide sluiceway section with a 4-foot-wide fish ladder and a 14-
foot-wide corrugated steel radial gate and (b) a 96-foot-wide 
uncontrolled overflow spillway with a crest elevation of 5,530-feet 
mean sea level (msl); (2) a 7-acre impoundment with a storage capacity 
of 28 acre-feet at a normal water surface elevation of 5,530-feet msl; 
(3) a 178-foot-long, 8.5-foot-deep fish screen with 3/8-inch clear bar 
spacing; (4) three intake openings located behind the fish screen each 
equipped with 10-foot-wide intake gates and 10-foot-wide trash racks 
with 3-inch clear bar spacing; (5) three, 8-foot-square unlined rock 
tunnels connecting the intakes to penstocks and consisting of: (a) a 
179-foot-long Tunnel No. 1 connecting to a 280-foot- long, 78-inch-
diameter steel penstock that bifurcates into two, 180-foot-long, 60-
inch-diameter steel penstocks that connect to Powerhouse No. 1; and (b) 
a 177-foot-long Tunnel No. 2 and a 196-foot-long Tunnel No. 3 each 
connecting to a 1,750-foot-long, 96- inch-diameter steel penstock that 
connects to Powerhouse No. 2; (6) an 83-foot-long, 26- foot-wide, 13-
foot-high reinforced concrete Powerhouse No. 1 containing two 
horizontal Francis turbine-generator units with a combined generating 
capacity of 1,950 kilowatts (kW); (7) a 36-foot-long, 36-foot-wide, 25-
foot-high reinforced concrete Powerhouse No. 2 containing two vertical 
Francis turbine-generator units with a combined generating capacity of 
5,500 kW; (8) two tailrace channels discharging to the Teton River from 
Powerhouses No. 1 and No. 2; (9) a 1,500-foot-long, 4.16 kilovolt (kV) 
overhead transmission line connecting Powerhouse No. 1 to a transformer 
located next to Powerhouse No. 2; (10) a 2,000-foot-long, 24.9 kV 
overhead transmission line leading from the transformer to the grid 
interconnection point; and (11) appurtenant facilities. Fall River also 
maintains a portage trail, parking area, restroom, signage, and boating 
take-out.
    The project has a total authorized capacity of 7,450 kilowatts (kW) 
and an average annual generation of 33,100 megawatt-hours (MWh). Fall 
River currently operates the project in a run-of-river mode such that 
outflow from the project approximates inflow. The project has a maximum 
hydraulic capacity of 900 cubic feet per second (cfs) when all four 
turbine generator units in Powerhouse No. 1 (upper powerhouse) and 
Powerhouse No. 2 (lower powerhouse) are operating. The minimum and 
maximum hydraulic capacities of Powerhouse No. 1 are 50 and 500 cfs, 
respectively. The minimum and maximum hydraulic capacities of 
Powerhouse No. 2 are 62.5 and 500 cfs, respectively. However, 
Powerhouse No. 1 has been inoperable since 2006 and has recently been 
repaired.
    During normal operation, water discharged from Powerhouse No. 2 
bypasses a 1,950-foot reach of the Teton River between the dam and the 
tailrace of the powerhouse. Water discharged from Powerhouse No. 1, 
which is located just upstream of Powerhouse No. 2, bypasses a 1,400- 
foot reach of the Teton River. The project is required to discharge a 
minimum flow from the dam into the bypassed reach of 20 cfs from July 1 
to March 14 and 50 cfs from March 15 to June 30. The minimum bypass 
flow is manually set by adjusting the radial gate opening until the 
correct minimum flow is indicated by a staff gauge below the dam. 
During periods of high flows, the project operates at maximum capacity. 
Excess flows beyond the required minimum flow into the bypassed reach 
and the maximum hydraulic capacity of the turbines are passed through 
the project's radial gate and discharged over the spillway.
    Fall River proposes to continue to operate the Felt Project in a 
run-of-river mode and maintain existing project facilities. Fall River 
proposes to remove 30.14 acres of land from the current project 
boundary. Fall River also proposes to implement a Yellowstone cutthroat 
trout conservation plan, continue to implement weed control measures, 
improve the portage trail and recreation access trail, and install a 
warning siren at both powerhouses to warn visitors of sudden flow 
changes in the event of sudden tripping of the project that causes 
sudden flow changes from either powerhouse.
