Abstract of Proposed Collection

    Consular officers use the DS-5537 to evaluate and adjudicate an 
applicant's eligibility for a visa in accordance with the Tom Lantos 
Block Burmese JADE (Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act of 2008, 
Public Law 110-286. The JADE Act renders certain individuals involved 
in specified Burmese organizations or activities, as well as their 
immediate family members, ineligible for U.S. visas.

Methodology

    All Burmese nationals applying for a U.S. visa are required to 
complete the JADE Act questionnaire. The form is available on Embassy 
Rangoon's website, or consular staff may provide the applicant with a 
copy of the form directly. Immigrant visa applicants receive an email 
with detailed guidance for the interview and the questionnaire as an 
attachment. Nonimmigrant visa applicants typically receive the 
questionnaire through their appointment confirmation or from the 
embassy website. Applicants are required to bring the completed and 
signed form to the interview.

Deputy Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Department of 
State.
