I. Executive Summary

A. Does this action apply to me?

    This action provides information that is directed to the public in 
general.

B. What is the Agency's authority for taking this action?

    EPA is publishing this document in the Federal Register as required 
by sections 5 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. 
2601 et seq., and corresponding EPA regulations.
    Under TSCA, a chemical substance may be either an ``existing'' 
chemical substance or a ``new'' chemical substance, see <a href="https://www.epa.gov/chemicals-under-tsca">https://www.epa.gov/chemicals-under-tsca</a>. Any chemical substance that is not on 
EPA's TSCA Inventory of Chemical Substances (TSCA Inventory) is 
classified as a ``new chemical substance,'' while a chemical substance 
that is listed on the TSCA Inventory is classified as an ``existing 
chemical substance.'' See TSCA section 3(2) and (11). For more 
information about the TSCA Inventory, see <a href="https://www.epa.gov/inventory">https://www.epa.gov/inventory</a>.
    Any person who intends to manufacture (including import) a new 
chemical substance for a non-exempt commercial purpose, or to 
manufacture or process a chemical substance in a non-exempt manner for 
a use that EPA has determined is a significant new use, is required by 
TSCA section 5 to provide EPA with a PMN, MCAN, or SNUN, as 
appropriate, before initiating the activity. EPA will review the 
notice, make a risk determination on the new chemical substance or 
significant new use, and take appropriate action as described in TSCA 
section 5(a)(3).
    TSCA section 5(h)(1) authorizes EPA to allow persons, upon 
application and under appropriate restrictions, to manufacture a new 
chemical substance, or manufacture or process a chemical substance 
subject to a significant new use rule (SNUR) issued under TSCA section 
5(a)(2), for ``test marketing'' purposes, upon a showing that the 
manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of 
the chemical substances will not present an unreasonable risk of injury 
to health or the environment. This is referred to as a test marketing 
exemption, or TME.
    Premanufacture notification procedures for review of certain new 
microbial products of biotechnology are established in 40 CFR part 725. 
These pertain to MCANs and biotechnology exemptions, including TSCA 
experimental release applications (TERAs), TMEs for microorganisms, and 
Tier I and Tier II exemptions.

C. What action is the Agency taking?

    This document provides notice of receipt and status reports for the 
covered period and certain submissions under TSCA section 5 and 
provides an opportunity to comment on this information. The Agency is 
providing information about the receipt of PMNs, SNUNs, MCANs, and 
amendments to a previously submitted notice; test information; 
biotechnology exemption applications under 40 CFR part 725; TME 
applications; NOCs for new chemical substances; and a periodic status 
report on chemical substances that are currently under EPA review or 
have recently concluded review.

D. What should I consider as I prepare my comments for EPA?

    1. Submitting CBI. Do not submit CBI to EPA through <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> or email. If you wish to include CBI in your 
comment, please follow the instructions at <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets#rules">https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets#rules</a> and clearly mark the information that you 
claim to be CBI. In addition to one complete version of the comment 
that includes CBI, a copy of the comment without CBI must be submitted 
for inclusion in the public docket. Information marked as CBI will not 
be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR 
parts 2 and 703.
    2. Tips for preparing your comments. When preparing and submitting 
your comments, see the commenting tips at <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets">https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets</a>.

II. Background

A. What information is being provided in this document?

the TSCA section 5 submissions received by EPA during this period and 
determined to be complete consistent with 40 CFR 720.70(a).
    <bullet> Case number. The EPA number assigned to the TSCA section 5 
submissions. Please note that a case number may be listed more than 
once in the table when the submission involves a subsequent amendment.
    <bullet> Chemical substance. Name of the chemical substance, or 
generic name if the specific name is claimed as CBI.
    <bullet> Manufacturer. Name of the submitting manufacturer, to the 
extent that such information is not subject to a CBI claim. The term 
``manufacturer'' is defined by statute to include importer.
    <bullet> Use(s). Potential uses identified by the manufacturer.
    <bullet> Received. Date the submission was received by EPA.
    <bullet> Commencement. Date of commencement provided by the 
submitter in the NOC.
    <bullet> Test information. For test information received, the type 
of test information submitted to EPA based on the attachment type and 
subtype data selected by the submitter.

B. What do the acronyms mean that are used in the tables?

    As used in each of the tables, the following explanations apply:
    <bullet> (S) indicates that the information in the table is the 
specific information provided by the submitter.
    <bullet> (G) indicates that the information in the table is generic 
information because the specific information provided by the submitter 
was claimed as CBI.

C. How can I access other information about TSCA section 5 submissions?

    EPA provides information on its website about cases reviewed under 
TSCA section 5, including the PMNs, SNUNs, MCANs, and exemption 
applications received; the date of receipt; the final EPA determination 
on the submission; and the effective date of EPA's determination. See 
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/new-chemicals-under-toxic-substances-control-act-tsca/pre-manufacture-notices">https://www.epa.gov/new-chemicals-under-toxic-substances-control-act-tsca/pre-manufacture-notices</a>. In addition, information EPA receives 
about chemical substances under TSCA, including non-CBI new chemical 
submissions, can be accessed in ChemView at <a href="https://chemview.epa.gov/">https://chemview.epa.gov/</a> gov/.
