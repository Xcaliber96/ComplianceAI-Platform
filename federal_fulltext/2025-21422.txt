[Docket No. MARAD-2025-0894]


Request for Comments on the Renewal of a Previously Approved 
Information Collection: Mariner Cadet Training-Agreements, Compliance 
Reporting, and Audits

AGENCY: Maritime Administration (MARAD), U.S. Department of 
Transportation (DOT).

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: MARAD invites public comments on its intention to request 
approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to renew an 
information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995. The proposed collection OMB 2133-0553 (Mariner Cadet Training-
Agreements, Compliance Reporting, and Audits) is being updated to 
remove references to collection instrument placeholders that will no 
longer be implemented. Consequently, there is a decrease in the total 
public burden for this collection. MARAD is required to publish this 
notice in the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and 
affected agencies.

DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before January 27, 2026.

ADDRESSES: You may submit comments identified by Docket No. MARAD-2025-
0894 through one of the following methods:
    <bullet> Federal eRulemaking Portal: <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a>. Search 
using the above DOT docket number and follow the online instructions 
for submitting comments.
    <bullet> Mail or Hand Delivery: Docket Management Facility, U.S. 
Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, West Building, 
Room W12-140, Washington, DC 20590, between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday 
through Friday, except on Federal holidays.
    Instructions: All submissions must include the agency name and 
docket number for this rulemaking.

    Note: All comments received will be posted without change to 
<a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a> including any personal information provided.

    Comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed collection of 
information is reasonable for the Department's performance; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimated burden; (c) ways for the Department to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collection; and (d) ways that the burden could be lessened without 
reducing the quality of the collected information. The agency will 
summarize and/or include your comments in the request for OMB's 
clearance of this information collection.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Mariner Cadet Training-Agreements, Compliance Reporting, and 
Audits.
    OMB Control Number: 2133-0553.
    Type of Request: Extension of a currently approved collection.
    Abstract: In accordance with its delegation of authority at 49 CFR 
1.93(a), and pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 50101(a)(4), MARAD is charged with 
ensuring that the United States Merchant Marine is manned with trained 
and efficient citizen personnel. Furthermore, 46 U.S.C. 51322 requires 
MARAD to protect cadet mariners from sexual assault onboard vessels, 
establish sexual assault policy, and conduct random and targeted 
unannounced checks of commercial vessels. MARAD must obtain information 
from commercial vessel operators in order to meet its statutory 
objectives of setting sexual assault policy and monitoring compliance, 
which are essential to its mission of ensuring a well-trained U.S. 
Merchant Marine. MARAD uses information compiled through this 
collection to confirm acceptance of sexual assault policies by 
commercial vessel operators. This collection also establishes a process 
to oversee and monitor continued sexual assault policy compliance 
through reporting and auditing of commercial vessel operators, during 
initial enrollment and subsequent Sea Years.
    Respondents: Commercial vessel operators employing United States 
Merchant Marine cadets onboard their vessels.
    Affected Public: Individuals and households.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 75.
    Estimated Number of Responses: 1.
    Estimated Hours per Response: .25 to 6 hours.

[[Page 54860]]

    Annual Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 108.75.
    Frequency of Response: Once annually and/or following incident of a 
sexual assault or harassment.

(Authority: The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995; 44 U.S.C. Chapter 
35, as amended; and 49 CFR 1.49.)

    By Order of the Maritime Administration.
T. Mitchell Hudson, Jr.,
Secretary, Maritime Administration.
