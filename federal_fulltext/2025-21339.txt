request the NRT's investigative and crime scene services in responding 
to arson and explosives events. The information is used for internal 
audits that support the NRT's national-level forensics accreditation.

Revisions to This Information Collection

    ATF is revising this ICR, OMB control number 1140-0091, to reflect 
a change from surveys by mail through emailed surveys to now online 
surveys. In addition, ATF has streamlined the invitation process. As a 
result of these changes, the time burden for individual respondents has 
decreased from .5 hours to .25 hours. In addition, the number of arson 
and explosives crime scene events was lower during the past three 
years, resulting in a decrease in the annual number of respondents, 
from 32 in 2022 to 18, a decrease of 14 respondents. These combined 
changes have resulted in a corresponding decrease in total hourly 
burden from 16 to five, a decrease of 11 hours. In addition, ATF has 
added a monetized value for the time burden, due to new OMB request, 
which has not been in previous ICRs.
