14 CFR Part 39

[Docket No. FAA-2025-5036; Project Identifier MCAI-2024-00748-R]
RIN 2120-AA64


Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) 
for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC120B helicopters. This proposed AD 
was prompted by a report of cyclic flight control restrictions due to 
the incorrect positioning of the bonding braid on the socket of the 
pilot cyclic stick, which limited full movement of the pilot cyclic 
stick during flight. This proposed AD would require a one-time 
inspection of the position of the bonding braid on the socket of the 
pilot cyclic stick and, depending on the results, correcting the 
positioning of the bonding braid and installing a binding clamp. The 
FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these 
products.

DATES: The FAA must receive comments on this NPRM by January 12, 2026.

ADDRESSES: You may send comments, using the procedures found in 14 CFR 
11.43 and 11.45, by any of the following methods:

closing date and may amend this proposal because of those comments.
    Except for Confidential Business Information (CBI) as described in 
the following paragraph, and other information as described in 14 CFR 
11.35, the FAA will post all comments received, without change, to 
<a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a>, including any personal information you provide. The 
agency will also post a report summarizing each substantive verbal 
contact received about this NPRM.

[[Page 54602]]

Confidential Business Information

    CBI is commercial or financial information that is both customarily 
and actually treated as private by its owner. Under the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), CBI is exempt from public 
disclosure. If your comments responsive to this NPRM contain commercial 
or financial information that is customarily treated as private, that 
you actually treat as private, and that is relevant or responsive to 
this NPRM, it is important that you clearly designate the submitted 
comments as CBI. Please mark each page of your submission containing 
CBI as ``PROPIN.'' The FAA will treat such marked submissions as 
confidential under the FOIA, and they will not be placed in the public 
docket of this NPRM. Submissions containing CBI should be sent to 
Steven Warwick, Aviation Safety Engineer, FAA, 1600 Stewart Avenue, 
Suite 410, Westbury, NY 11590. Any commentary that the FAA receives 
which is not specifically designated as CBI will be placed in the 
public docket for this rulemaking.

Background

    EASA, which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the 
European Union, has issued EASA AD 2024-0243, dated December 13, 2024 
(EASA AD 2024-0243) (also referred to as the MCAI), to address an 
unsafe condition for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC 120 B helicopters. 
The MCAI advises of a report that a pilot experienced several 
occurrences of a cyclic flight control restriction when turning right 
during an instruction flight. Subsequent investigation determined that 
the bonding braid on the socket of the pilot cyclic stick had moved to 
an incorrect position, which limited full movement of the pilot cyclic 
stick. This condition, if not addressed, could result in a cyclic 
flight control restriction during flight and consequent loss of control 
of the helicopter.
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2025-5036.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2024-0243, which specifies a one-time 
inspection of the position of the bonding braid on the socket of the 
pilot cyclic stick and, depending on the results, correcting the 
positioning of the bonding braid and installing a binding clamp. This 
material is reasonably available because the interested parties have 
access to it through their normal course of business or by the means 
identified in the ADDRESSES section.

FAA's Determination

    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority 
(CAA) of another country and are approved for operation in the United 
States. Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of 
Design Authority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe 
condition described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA is issuing 
this NPRM after determining that the unsafe condition described 
previously is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same 
type design.

Proposed AD Requirements in This NPRM

    This proposed AD would require accomplishing the actions specified 
in EASA AD 2024-0243, described previously, as incorporated by 
reference, except for any differences identified as exceptions in the 
regulatory text of this proposed AD.

Explanation of Required Compliance Information

    In the FAA's ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of the AD 
process, the FAA developed a process to use some CAA ADs as the primary 
source of information for compliance with requirements for 
corresponding FAA ADs. The FAA has been coordinating this process with 
manufacturers and CAAs. As a result, the FAA proposes to incorporate 
EASA AD 2024-0243 by reference in the FAA final rule. This proposed AD 
would, therefore, require compliance with EASA AD 2024-0243 in its 
entirety through that incorporation, except for any differences 
identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of this proposed AD. 
Using common terms that are the same as the heading of a particular 
section in EASA AD 2024-0243 does not mean that operators need comply 
only with that section. For example, where the AD requirement refers to 
``all required actions and compliance times,'' compliance with this AD 
requirement is not limited to the section titled ``Required Action(s) 
and Compliance Time(s)'' in EASA AD 2024-0243. Material referenced in 
EASA AD 2024-0243 for compliance will be available at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> 
under Docket No. FAA-2025-5036 after the FAA final rule is published.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD, if adopted as proposed, would 
affect 72 helicopters of U.S. registry.
    The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this proposed 
AD.

                                                 Estimated Costs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                     Cost per      Cost on U.S.
                Action                         Labor cost           Parts cost        product        operators
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 install binding clamp.                  hour = $85.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FAA estimates the following costs to do any repairs that would 
be required based on the results of the proposed inspection. The agency 
has no way of determining the number of helicopters that might need 
this repair.

                                               On-Condition Costs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                     Cost per
                    Action                                 Labor cost               Parts cost        product

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship 
between the national government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed 
regulation:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
