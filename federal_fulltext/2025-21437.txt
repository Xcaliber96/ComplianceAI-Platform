14 CFR Part 39

[Docket No. FAA-2025-5034; Project Identifier MCAI-2025-00951-R]
RIN 2120-AA64


Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) 
for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, AS332L1, and 
AS332L2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of 
rupture of the scissors link of the rotating swashplate assembly due to 
a seized ball joint-cups assembly. This proposed AD would require 
replacing the rotor shaft assembly, modifying the rotating swashplate 
assembly to replace each of the three ball joint-cups assemblies with 
one-piece self-lubricated spherical bearings, and modifying the 
scissors hinges and swashplate trunnions on the main rotor, as 
applicable, and applying an anti-corrosion agent, if applicable. This 
proposed AD would prohibit installing a main rotor hub (MRH) assembly 
or rotor shaft assembly on a helicopter unless certain requirements are 
met. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on 
these products.

Confidential Business Information

    CBI is commercial or financial information that is both customarily 
and actually treated as private by its owner. Under the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), CBI is exempt from public 
disclosure. If your comments responsive to this NPRM contain commercial 
or financial information that is customarily treated as private, that 
you actually treat as private, and that is relevant or

[[Page 54597]]

responsive to this NPRM, it is important that you clearly designate the 
submitted comments as CBI. Please mark each page of your submission 
containing CBI as ``PROPIN.'' The FAA will treat such marked 
submissions as confidential under the FOIA, and they will not be placed 
in the public docket of this NPRM. Submissions containing CBI should be 
sent to Adam Hein, Aviation Safety Engineer, FAA, 1600 Stewart Avenue, 
Suite 410, Westbury, NY 11590. Any commentary that the FAA receives 
which is not specifically designated as CBI will be placed in the 
public docket for this rulemaking.

Background

    EASA, which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the 
European Union, issued EASA AD 2024-0168, dated August 22, 2024 (EASA 
AD 2024-0168), to correct an unsafe condition on Airbus Helicopters 
Model AS 332 C, AS 332 C1, AS 332 L, AS 332 L1, and AS 332 L2 
helicopters. The MCAI states that an occurrence was reported of rupture 
of the scissors link of the rotating swashplate assembly resulting from 
a seized ball joint-cups assembly. Subsequent investigation revealed 
the following probable causes: the cups and ball joint that are 
normally paired were unpaired or mixed during an overhaul; and the cups 
and ball joint assembly had not been properly lubricated during 
overhaul. In addition, the cups and the ball joint are made of tungsten 
carbide, whose failure mode can cause a sudden seizure of the assembly. 
This condition, if not addressed, could lead to loss of connection 
between rotor shaft and rotating swashplate and consequent loss of 
control of the helicopter.
    EASA AD 2024-0168 specified a modification to replace the ball 
joint-cups assembly with a one-piece self-lubricated spherical bearing 
and specified modification instructions for in-service helicopters. 
EASA then superseded EASA AD 2024-0168 and issued EASA AD 2025-0116, 
dated May 19, 2025 (EASA AD 2025-0116) (also referred to as the MCAI). 
The MCAI states that since EASA AD 2024-0168 was issued, it was 
identified that the original service information did not provide 
instructions to apply anti-corrosion agent on the parts during 
installation, and Airbus Helicopters revised the service information to 
address that omission. The MCAI partially retains the requirements of 
EASA AD 2024-0168 and specifies additional work.
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2025-5034.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2025-0116, which specifies procedures for 
replacing the rotor shaft assembly, modifying the rotating swashplate 
assembly, or replacing the MRH assembly as an alternative action for 
certain helicopters, as applicable. EASA AD 2025-0116 specifies 
procedures for certain helicopters to incorporate modification 0743046 
either before or concurrently with the modification of the rotating 
swashplate assembly. EASA AD 2025-0116 also specifies procedures for 
applying anti-corrosion agent on the parts, as applicable. EASA AD 
2025-0116 prohibits installing a MRH assembly or a rotor shaft assembly 
unless it is a post-mod 0728849 configuration.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

FAA's Determination

    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority 
of another country and are approved for operation in the United States. 
Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design 
Authority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA is issuing this NPRM 
after determining that the unsafe condition described previously is 
likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design.

Proposed AD Requirements in This NPRM

    This proposed AD would require Group 1 helicopters (as defined in 
the MCAI) to replace the rotor shaft assembly, Group 2 helicopters (as 
defined in the MCAI) to modify the rotating swashplate assembly to 
replace each of the three ball joint-cups assemblies with one-piece 
self-lubricated spherical bearings or replace the MRH assembly with an 
MRH assembly in post-mod 0728849 and post-mod 0743046 configurations, 
and AS332C and AS332L helicopters to modify the scissors hinges and 
swashplate trunnions on the main rotor, as applicable. This proposed AD 
would also require Group 3 helicopters (as defined in the MCAI) to 
apply an anti-corrosion agent, if applicable. This proposed AD would 
prohibit installing a main rotor hub (MRH) assembly or rotor shaft 
assembly on a helicopter unless certain requirements are met.

Explanation of Required Compliance Information

    In the FAA's ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of the AD 
process, the FAA developed a process to use some civil aviation 
authority (CAA) ADs as the primary source of information for compliance 
with requirements for corresponding FAA ADs. The FAA has been 
coordinating this process with manufacturers and CAAs. As a result, the 
FAA incorporates EASA AD 2025-0116 by reference in the FAA final rule. 
This proposed AD would, therefore, require compliance with EASA AD 
2025-0116 in its entirety through that incorporation, except for any 
differences identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of this 
proposed AD. Using common terms that are the same as the heading of a 
particular section in EASA AD 2025-0116 does not mean that operators 
need comply only with that section. For example, where the AD 
requirement refers to ``all required actions and compliance times,'' 
compliance with this AD requirement is not limited to the section 
titled ``Required Action(s) and Compliance Time(s)'' in EASA AD 2025-
0116. Material referenced in EASA AD 2025-0116 for compliance will be 
available at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under Docket No. FAA-2025-5034 after the 
FAA final rule is published.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD, if adopted as proposed, would 
affect 12 helicopters of U.S. registry.
    The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this proposed 
AD:

                                                 Estimated Costs

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[Page 54598]]

    The FAA has received no definitive data on which to base the cost 
estimates for replacing the rotor shaft assembly with a rotor shaft 
assembly that has incorporated modifications 0743714 and 0728849, 
modifying the rotating swashplate assembly to incorporate modification 
0743046, or for the optional action of replacing the MRH assembly with 
an MRH assembly that has incorporated modifications 0728849 and 0743046 
specified in this proposed AD.
    The FAA has included all known costs in its cost estimate. 
According to the manufacturer, however, some of the costs of this 
proposed AD may be covered under warranty, thereby reducing the cost 
impact on affected operators.

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship 
between the national government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed 
regulation:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
