40 CFR Part 180

[EPA-HQ-OPP-2025-1972; FRL-13038-01-OCSPP]


Propyzamide; Extension of Tolerance for Emergency Exemption

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This regulation extends the time-limited tolerance for 
residues of propyzamide in or on cranberry for an additional three-year 
period. The time-limited tolerance expires on December 31, 2028. This 
action is in response to EPA's granting of an emergency exemption under 
section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act 
(FIFRA) authorizing use of this pesticide. In addition, the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requires EPA to establish a time-
limited tolerance or exemption from the requirement for a tolerance for 
pesticide chemical residues in food that will result from the use of a 
pesticide under an emergency exemption granted by EPA under FIFRA.

DATES: This regulation is effective November 26, 2025. Objections and 
requests for hearings must be received on or before January 26, 2026 
and must be filed in accordance with the instructions provided in 40 
CFR part 178 (see also Unit I.C. of the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION).

INFORMATION CONTACT.

B. What is EPA's authority for taking this action?

    The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requires EPA to 
establish a time-limited tolerance or exemption from the requirement of 
a tolerance for pesticide chemical residues in food that will result 
from the use of a pesticide under an emergency exemption granted by EPA 
under FIFRA. This regulation extends the time-limited tolerance for 
residues of propyzamide in or on cranberry for an additional three-year 
period. The time-limited tolerance expires on December 31, 2028.

C. How can I file an objection or hearing request?

    Under FFDCA section 408(g), 21 U.S.C. 346a(g), any person may file 
an objection to any aspect of this regulation and may also request a 
hearing on those objections. If you fail to file an objection to the 
final rule within the time period specified in the final rule, you will 
have waived the right to raise any issues resolved in the final rule. 
You must file your objection or request a hearing on this regulation in 
accordance with the instructions provided in 40 CFR part 178. To ensure 
proper receipt by EPA, you must identify the docket ID number EPA-HQ-
OPP-2025-1972 in the subject line on the first page of your submission. 
All objections and requests for a hearing must be in writing and must 
be received by the Hearing Clerk on or before January 26, 2026.
    The EPA's Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ), in which the 
Hearing Clerk is housed, urges parties to

[[Page 54241]]

file and serve documents by electronic means only, notwithstanding any 
other particular requirements set forth in other procedural rules 
governing those proceedings. See ``Revised Order Urging Electronic 
Filing and Service,'' dated June 22, 2023, which can be found at

II. Background and Statutory Findings

    EPA previously published a final rule, establishing a time-limited 
tolerance in the Federal Register of November 12, 2019 (84 FR 60937) 
(FRL-10000-50), for the residues of propyzamide in or on cranberry. EPA 
established the tolerance because FFDCA section 408(l)(6) requires EPA 
to establish a time-limited tolerance or exemption from the requirement 
for a tolerance for pesticide chemical residues in food that will 
result from the use of a pesticide under an emergency exemption granted 
by EPA under FIFRA section 18. Such tolerances can be established 
without providing notice or period for public comment.
    EPA received a request to extend emergency use of propyzamide on 
cranberry for this year's growing season to control dodder 
infestations. After having reviewed the submission, EPA concurs that 
emergency conditions continue to exist.
    EPA assessed the potential risks presented by residues of 
propyzamide in or on cranberry. In doing so, EPA considered the safety 
standard in FFDCA section 408(b)(2) and decided that the necessary 
tolerance under FFDCA section 408(l)(6) would be consistent with the 
safety standard and with FIFRA section 18. The data and other relevant 
material have been evaluated and were discussed in the final rule that 
originally established the time-limited tolerance. Based on that data 
and information considered, the Agency reaffirms that extension of the 
time-limited tolerance will continue to meet the requirements of FFDCA 
section 408(l)(6). Therefore, the time-limited tolerance is extended 
until December 31, 2028. Although this tolerance will expire and is 
revoked on December 31, 2028, under FFDCA section 408(l)(5), residues 
of the pesticide not in excess of the amounts specified in the 
tolerance remaining in or on cranberry after that date will not be 
unlawful, provided the residues are present as a result of an 
application or use of a pesticide at a time and manner that was lawful 
under FIFRA, the tolerance was in place at the time of application, and 
the residues do not exceed the level that was authorized by the 
tolerance. EPA will take action to revoke the tolerance earlier if any 
experience with, scientific data on, or other relevant information on 
this pesticide indicates that the residues are not safe. EPA will 
publish a document in the Federal Register to remove the revoked 
tolerances from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
    Under FIFRA section 18, EPA authorized the use of propyzamide on 
cranberry for control of dodder in Massachusetts. This was done 
pursuant to a request by the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural 
Resources. This regulation extends a time-limited tolerance for 
residues of the herbicide propyzamide and its metabolites and 
degradates in or on cranberry at 1 part per million (ppm) for an 
additional 3-year period. This tolerance will expire and be revoked on 
December 31, 2028. The time-limited tolerance was originally published 
in the Federal Register of November 12, 2019 (84 FR 60937) (FRL-10000-
50).

III. International Residue Limits

    In making its tolerance decisions, EPA seeks to harmonize U.S. 
tolerances with international standards whenever possible, consistent 
with U.S. food safety standards and agricultural practices. EPA 
considers the international maximum residue limits (MRLs) established 
by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), as required by FFDCA 
section 408(b)(4). The Codex Alimentarius is a joint United Nations 
Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization food 
standards program, and it is recognized as an international food safety 
standards-setting organization in trade agreements to which the United 
States is a party. EPA may establish a tolerance that is different from 
a Codex MRL; however, FFDCA section 408(b)(4) requires that EPA explain 
the reasons for departing from the Codex level. The Codex has not 
established any MRLs for propyzamide.

VI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

    Additional information about these statutes and Executive Orders 
can be found at <a href="https://www.epa.gov/regulations/and-executive-orders">https://www.epa.gov/regulations/and-executive-orders</a>.

A. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review

    This action is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866 (58 
FR 51735, October 4, 1993), because it establishes or modifies a 
pesticide tolerance or a tolerance exemption under FFDCA section 408 in 
response to a petition submitted to the Agency. The Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted these types of actions from 
review under Executive Order 12866.

B. Executive Order 14192: Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation

    Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, February 6, 2025) does not apply 
because actions that establish a tolerance under FFDCA section 408 are 
exempted from review under Executive Order 12866.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)

    This action does not impose an information collection burden under 
the PRA 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., because it does not contain any 
information collection activities.

D. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)

    Since tolerances and exemptions that are established in accordance 
with FFDCA sections 408(e) and 408(l)(6), such as the tolerance in this 
final rule, do not require the issuance of a proposed rule, the 
requirements of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., do not apply.

E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA)

    This action does not contain an unfunded mandate of $100 million or 
more (in 1995 dollars and adjusted

[[Page 54242]]

annually for inflation) as described in UMRA, 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538 and 
does not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. The action 
imposes no enforceable duty on any State, local, or Tribal governments 
or on the private sector.

F. Executive Order 13132: Federalism

    This action does not have federalism implications as specified in 
Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), because it will 
not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship 
between the National Government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.

G. Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian 
Tribal Governments

    This action does not have Tribal implications as specified in 
Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), because it will 
not have substantial direct effects on Tribal governments, on the 
relationship between the Federal Government and the Indian Tribes, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal 
Government and Indian Tribes.

H. Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children From Environmental 
Health Risks and Safety Risks

    This action is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, 
April 23, 1997) because tolerance actions like this one are exempt from 
review under Executive Order 12866. However, EPA's 2021 Policy on 
Children's Health applies to this action. This rule finalizes tolerance 
actions under the FFDCA, which requires EPA to give special 
consideration to exposure of infants and children to the pesticide 
chemical residue in establishing a tolerance and to ``ensure that there 
is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and 
children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue . . 
.'' (FFDCA 408(b)(2)(C)).

I. Executive Order 13211: Actions Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution or Use

    This action is not subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355) 
(May 22, 2001) because it is not a significant regulatory action under 
Executive Order 12866.

J. National Technology Transfer Advancement Act (NTTAA)

    This action does not involve technical standards that would require 
Agency consideration under NTTAA section 12(d), 15 U.S.C. 272.

K. Congressional Review Act (CRA)

    This action is subject to the CRA, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq., and EPA 
will submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the 
Comptroller General of the United States. This action is not a ``major 
rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).
