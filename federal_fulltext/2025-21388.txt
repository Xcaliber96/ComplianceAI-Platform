SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[OMB Control No. 3235-0067]


Agency Information Collection Activities; Submission for OMB 
Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form S-11--Registration Statement

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Form S-11 (17 CFR 239.18) is the registration statement form used 
to register securities issued by real estate investment trusts or by 
issuers whose business is primarily that of acquiring and holding for 
investment interests in real estate under the Securities Act of 1933 
(15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.). The information collected is intended to 
ensure the adequacy of information available to investors in connection 
with securities offerings. The information required by Form S-11 is 
mandatory, and Form S-11 is publicly available on the Commission's 
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (``EDGAR'') system. 
We estimate that Form S-11 takes approximately 732.48 hours per 
response and is filed once per year by approximately 14 issuers, for a 
total of approximately 14 responses annually. We estimate that 25% of 
the 732.48 hours per response is carried internally by the issuer for 
annual reporting burden of 2,564 hours ((25% x 732.48 hours per 
response) x 14 responses). We estimate that 75% of the 732.48 hours per 
response is carried externally by outside professionals retained by the 
issuer at an estimated rate of $600 per hour for a total annual cost 
burden of $4,614,624 ((75% x 732.48 hours per response) x $600 per hour 
x 14 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB Control Number.
    The public may view and comment on this information collection
