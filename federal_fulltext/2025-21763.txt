How to file protests, motions to intervene, and comments is explained

Protests

    Pursuant to section 157.205 of the Commission's regulations under 
the NGA,\1\ any person \2\ or the Commission's staff may file a protest 
to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed or if a 
protest is filed and then withdrawn within 30 days after the allowed 
time for filing a protest, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be 
authorized effective the day after the time allowed for protest. If a 
protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time 
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request for authorization 
will be considered by the Commission.

    \1\ 18 CFR 157.205.
    \2\ Persons include individuals, organizations, businesses, 
municipalities, and other entities. 18 CFR 385.102(d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Protests must comply with the requirements specified in section 
157.205(e) of the Commission's regulations,\3\ and must be submitted by 
the protest deadline, which is 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 26, 
2026. A protest may also serve as a motion to intervene so long as the 
protestor states it also seeks to be an intervenor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ 18 CFR 157.205(e).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interventions

    Any person has the option to file a motion to intervene in this 
proceeding. Only intervenors have the right to request rehearing of 
Commission orders issued in this proceeding and to subsequently 
challenge the Commission's orders in the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal.
    To intervene, you must submit a motion to intervene to the 
Commission in accordance with Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of 
Practice and Procedure \4\ and the regulations under the NGA \5\ by the 
intervention deadline for the project, which is 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time 
on January 26, 2026. As described further in Rule 214, your motion to 
intervene must state, to the extent known, your position regarding the 
proceeding, as well as your interest in the proceeding. For an 
individual, this could include your status as a landowner, ratepayer, 
resident of an impacted community, or recreationist. You do not need to 
have property directly impacted by the project in order to intervene. 
For more information about motions to intervene, refer to the FERC 
website at <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/resources/guides/how-to/intervene.asp">https://www.ferc.gov/resources/guides/how-to/intervene.asp</a>.

    \5\ 18 CFR 157.10.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    All timely, unopposed motions to intervene are automatically 
granted by operation of Rule 214(c)(1). Motions to intervene that are 
filed after the intervention deadline are untimely and may be denied. 
Any late-filed motion to intervene must show good cause for being late 
and must explain why the time limitation should be waived and provide 
justification by reference to factors set forth in Rule 214(d) of the 
Commission's Rules and Regulations. A person obtaining party status 
will be placed on the service list maintained by the Secretary of the 
Commission and will receive copies (paper or electronic) of all 
documents filed by the applicant and by all other parties.

Comments

    Any person wishing to comment on the project may do so. The 
Commission considers all comments received about the project in 
determining the appropriate action to be taken. To ensure that your 
comments are timely and properly recorded, please submit your comments 
on or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 26, 2026. The filing of 
a comment alone will not serve to make the filer a party to the 
proceeding. To become a party, you must intervene in the proceeding.
