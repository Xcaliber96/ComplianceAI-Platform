SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 
CFR part 39 by adding an AD that would apply to all Airbus Canada 
Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. The 
NPRM was published in the Federal Register on March 3, 2025 (90 FR 
11033). The NPRM was prompted by AD CF-2024-23, dated June 18, 2024 
(Transport Canada AD CF-2024-23) (also referred to as the MCAI), issued 
by Transport Canada, which is the aviation authority for Canada. The 
MCAI states there were events where the cargo bottle fail caution 
message was displayed during flight resulting in diversions. 
Investigations found the LRD bottle was depleted of extinguishing 
agent. Further investigation revealed the LRD bottle metering device 
could be loose allowing extinguishing agent to escape resulting in loss 
or degraded capability of the cargo extinguishing system.
    In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to require replacing affected LRD 
bottles, inspecting extinguishing discharge lines and tubes, and 
replacing extinguishing discharge lines and tubes, as applicable, and 
to prohibit the installation of affected LRD bottles, as specified in 
Transport Canada AD CF-2024-23. The FAA is issuing this AD to address 
the unsafe condition on these products.
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2025-0215.

Discussion of Final Airworthiness Directive

Comments

    The FAA received a comment from Air Line Pilots Association, 
International (ALPA) who supported the NPRM without change.
    The FAA received one additional comment from Delta Air Lines. The 
following presents the comment received on the NPRM and the FAA's 
response to each comment.

Request for Exception

    Delta Air Lines requested an additional exception be added to the 
proposed AD to correct a typographical error from ``LDR'' to ``LRD'' in 
Transport Canada AD CF-2024-23, Part I, paragraph B.
    The FAA agrees with this request and added paragraph (h)(4) of this 
AD accordingly.

Conclusion

    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority 
of another country and are approved for operation in the United States. 
Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design 
Authority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant 
data, considered any comments received, and determined that air safety 
requires adopting this AD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing 
this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Except for 
minor editorial changes, and any other changes described previously, 
this AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. None of the changes will 
increase the economic burden on any operator.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed Transport Canada AD CF-2024-23 which specifies 
procedures for verifying aircraft technical records to determine if an 
affected part (any LRD bottle having part number 475086-1, 475124-1 or 
475087-1 with certain serial numbers, unless the LRD bottle is marked 
with an encircled `C' on the LRD bottle label) is installed on the 
airplane, replacing affected LRD bottles, and replacing extinguishing 
discharge lines and tubes, as applicable. Transport Canada AD CF-2024-
23 also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The detailed 
visual inspections of the discharge lines and tubes, in multiple 
compartments, include checking discharge heads and distribution tubes 
for signs of residue and corrosion. This material is reasonably 
available because the interested parties have access to it through 
their normal course of business or by the means identified in the 
ADDRESSES section.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates this AD affects 74 airplanes of U.S. registry. 
The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:

                                      Estimated Costs for Required Actions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                    Cost per       Cost on U.S.
                          Labor cost                              Parts cost        product         operators
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16 work-hours x $85 per hour = $1,360........................              $0           $1,360         $100,640
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                 Estimated Costs of On-Condition Actions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
           Labor cost                 Parts cost       Cost per product
------------------------------------------------------------------------
10 work-hours x $85 per hour =    Up to $17,368.....  Up to $18,218.
 $850.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FAA has included all known costs in its cost estimate. 
According to the manufacturer, however, some or all of the costs of 
this AD may be covered under warranty, thereby reducing the cost impact 
on affected operators.

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA

[[Page 53199]]

with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by 
prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the 
Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This 
regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses 
an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products 
identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, 
on the relationship between the national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various 
levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
