60-Day Notice for the ``Application for International and 
Domestic Indemnification''; Proposed Collection; Comment Request

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The National Endowment for the Arts, as part of its continuing 
effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a 
preclearance consultation program to provide the general public and 
Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or 
continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995. This program helps ensure that requested data 
can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and 
financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly 
understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents 
can be properly assessed. Currently, the National Endowment for the 
Arts, on behalf of the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities, 
is soliciting comments concerning renewal of the Application for 
International and Domestic Indemnification. A copy of this collection 
request can be obtained by contacting the office listed below in the 
address section of this notice.

DATES: Written comments must be submitted to the office listed in the 
address section below within 60 days from the date of this publication 
in the Federal Register.

ADDRESSES: Send comments to Daniel Beattie, National Endowment for the 
Arts, via email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#caa5adbaa58aabb8beb9e4ada5bc"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bbd4dccbd4fbdac9cfc895dcd4cd">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The National Endowment for the Arts is 
particularly interested in comments which:
    <bullet> Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, 
including whether the information will have practical utility;
    <bullet> Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the 
burden of the proposed collection of information including the validity 
of the methodology and assumptions used;
    <bullet> Enhance the quality, utility and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and
    <bullet> Minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate 
automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting 
the electronic submissions of responses.

    Dated: November 25, 2025.
Daniel Beattie,
Director, Office of Guidelines & Panel Operations, National Endowment 
for the Arts.
