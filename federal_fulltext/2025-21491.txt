SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Sec.  1320.8(d), 
requires the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration 
(PHMSA) to provide interested members of the public and affected 
agencies the opportunity to comment on information collection and 
recordkeeping requests before they are submitted to OMB for approval. 
In accordance with this regulation, on July 15, 2025, PHMSA published a 
Federal Register notice (90 FR 31748) with a 60-day comment period 
soliciting comments on its intent to request OMB's renewed approval of 
the information collection requests that are due to expire in 2026.
    During the 60-day comment period, PHMSA received comment from an 
anonymous commenter and a joint comment from the American Gas 
Association and the American Public Gas Association (AGA Joint Comment) 
pertaining to the proposed renewal of certain information collections. 
The AGA Joint Comment addressed: 1. New Customer Notifications for 
Excess Flow Valves; 2. Notification Requirements for Gas Transmission 
Pipelines; and 3. Amendments to Annual Report for Gas Distribution 
Operators. The comment expressed concerns that these information 
collection activities are unnecessary and do not contribute 
meaningfully to pipeline safety. The AGA Joint Comment also proposed 
regulatory changes to eliminate the notification requirements which 
would need to be addressed through the formal rulemaking process. PHMSA 
has previously received input on notification requirements through 
rulemaking and RFIs,\1\ and such feedback will be considered during 
those proceedings.

    Abstract: The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-
355), 49 U.S.C. 60132, ``National Pipeline Mapping System,'' requires 
operators of a pipeline facility (except distribution lines and 
gathering lines) to provide information to the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Safety Administration. Each operator is required to submit geospatial 
data appropriate for use in the National Pipeline Mapping System or 
data in a format that can be readily converted to geospatial data, the 
name and address of the person with primary operational control (to be 
known as its operator), and a means for a member of the public to 
contact the operator for additional information about the pipeline 
facilities it operates. Operators will submit the requested data 
elements once and make annual updates to the data if necessary. These 
data elements strengthen the effectiveness of PHMSA's risk rankings and 
evaluations, which are used as a factor in determining pipeline 
inspection priority and frequency; allow for more effective assistance 
to emergency responders by providing them with a more reliable, 
complete data set of pipelines and facilities; and provide better 
support to PHMSA's inspectors by providing more accurate pipeline 
locations and additional pipeline-related geospatial data that can be 
linked to tabular data in PHMSA's inspection database.
