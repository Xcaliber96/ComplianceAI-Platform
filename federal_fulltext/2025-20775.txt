DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

Energy Information Administration


Agency Information Collection Extension

AGENCY: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Department of 
Energy (DOE).

ACTION: Notice and request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: EIA invites public comment on the proposed three-year 
extension, without changes, to the Coal Markets Reporting System 
(CMRS), as required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The CMRS 
consists of five surveys including, Form EIA-3 Quarterly Survey of Non-
Electric Sector Coal Data, Form EIA-7A Annual Survey of Coal Production 
and Preparation, Form EIA-8A Annual Survey of Coal Stocks and Coal 
Exports, Form EIA-6 Emergency Coal Supply Survey (Standby), and Form 
EIA-20 Emergency Weekly Coal Monitoring Survey for Coal Burning Power 
Producers (Standby.) The CMRS collects data on U.S. coal production, 
quality, consumption, receipts, stocks, and prices. EIA requests the 
extension to Forms EIA-3, EIA-6, EIA-7A, EIA-8A, and EIA-20 without 
change.

DATES: EIA must receive all comments on this proposed information 
collection no later than January 23, 2026. If you anticipate any 
difficulties in submitting your comments by the deadline, contact the 
person listed in the ADDRESSES section of this notice as soon as 
possible.

ADDRESSES: You may submit comments, identified by OMB control number 
1905-0167, by email at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d5909c94f893879bb6bab8b8b0bba1a695b0bcb4fbb2baa3"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="24616d650962766a474b4949414a505764414d450a434b52">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Include the OMB control

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This information collection request 
contains:
    (1) OMB Control Number: 1905-0167;
    (2) Information Collection Request Title: Coal Markets Reporting 
System;
    (3) Type of Request: Three-year extension without change;
    (4) Purpose: The Coal Markets Reporting System (CMRS) program 
collects, evaluates, assembles, analyzes, and disseminates information 
on coal production, sales, technology, reserves, and related economic 
and statistical information. This information is used to assess the 
adequacy of coal and other energy resources to meet near and longer-
term domestic demands and to promote sound policymaking, efficient 
markets, and public understanding of energy and its interaction with 
the economy and the environment. Form EIA-3 collects quarterly data on 
the use of coal at U.S. manufacturing plants, coal transformation/
processing plants, coke plants, and commercial and institutional users 
of coal.
    Form EIA-7A collects coal production operations, characteristics of 
coalbeds mined, recoverable reserves, production capacity, coal sales 
and revenue, stocks held at mines, and the disposition of the coal 
mined. For coal preparation, information collected includes operations, 
locations, production capacity, disposition, and volume of coal 
prepared.
    Form EIA-8A collects data on coal stocks by state location, 
exported coal by origin state, and export revenue of coal sold during 
the reporting year.
    Form EIA-6 Emergency Coal Supply Survey and Form EIA-20 Emergency 
Weekly Coal Monitoring Survey for Coal Burning Power Producers are 
standby surveys used during periods of coal supply and transportation 
disruptions. In the event of a supply or transportation disruption, 
these two standby surveys activate and operate weekly over a ten-week 
period. Once activated, Form EIA-6 collects weekly coal production and 
stocks data from U.S. coal mining companies. Data are aggregated and 
reported at the state level. During disruptive events, Form EIA-20 
collects available coal-fired capacity, generation, consumption, and 
stocks from coal-fired electric power generators.
    The CMRS also collects coal market data. The data elements include 
production, consumption, receipts, stocks, sales, and prices. 
Information pertaining to the quality of the coal is

[[Page 52928]]

also collected, including heat content, ash content, sulfur content and 
contents of mercury. Aggregates of this collection are used to support 
analysis on the effects of public policy on the coal industry, economic 
modeling, forecasting, coal supply and demand studies, and in guiding 
research and development programs. The data are included in EIA 
publications, such as the Monthly Energy Review, Quarterly Coal Report, 
Quarterly Coal Distribution Report, Annual Coal Report, and Annual Coal 
Distribution Report.
    EIA also uses the data in short-term and long-term forecast models 
such as the Short-Term Integrated Forecasting System (STIFS) and the 
National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) Coal Market Module. The forecast 
data also appear in the Short-Term Energy Outlook and the Annual Energy 
Outlook publications.
    (5) Annual Estimated Number of Respondents: 833.
    <bullet> Form EIA-3 will consist of 290 respondents;
    <bullet> Form EIA-7A will consist of 480 respondents;
    <bullet> Form EIA-8A will consist of 44 respondents;
    <bullet> Form EIA-6 (standby) will consist of 10 respondents;
    <bullet> Form EIA-20 (standby) will consist of 9 respondents.
    (6) Annual Estimated Number of Total Responses: 1,874
    (7) Annual Estimated Number of Burden Hours: 3,149
    (8) Annual Estimated Reporting and Recordkeeping Cost Burden: 
$299,123 (3,149 burden hours times $94.99 per hour). EIA estimates that 
there are no additional costs to respondents associated with the 
surveys other than the costs associated with the burden hours since the 
information is maintained during normal course of business.
    Comments are invited on whether or not: (a) The proposed collection 
of information is necessary for the proper performance of agency 
functions, including whether the information will have a practical 
utility; (b) EIA's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of 
information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions 
used, is accurate; (c) EIA can improve the quality, utility, and 
clarity of the information it will collect; and (d) EIA can minimize 
the burden of the collection of information on respondents, such as 
automated collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology.
    Statutory Authority: 15 U.S.C. 772(b) and 42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.

    Signed in Washington, DC, on November 20, 2025.

Director, Office of Statistical Methods and Research, U. S. Energy 
Information Administration.
