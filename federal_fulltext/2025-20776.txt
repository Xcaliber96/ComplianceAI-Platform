number, and the agency informs potential persons who are to respond to 
the collection of information that such persons are not required to 
respond to the collection of information unless it displays a currently 
valid OMB control number.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title of Collection: National Science Foundation (NSF) Small 
Business Innovation Research (SBIR)/Small Business Technology Transfer 
(STTR) Pre-Award Information Collection.
    OMB Control No.: 3145-0270.
    Abstract: The NSF SBIR/STTR programs focus on transforming 
scientific discovery into products and services with commercial 
potential and/or societal benefit. Unlike fundamental or basic research 
activities that focus on scientific and engineering discoveries, the 
NSF SBIR/STTR programs support the creation of opportunities to move 
fundamental science and engineering out of the lab and into the market 
at scale, through startups and small businesses representing deep 
technology ventures.
    The NSF SBIR/STTR programs have two phases: Phase I and Phase II. 
Phase I is a 6-12 month experimental or theoretical investigation that 
allows the awardees to determine the scientific and technical 
feasibility, as well as the commercial merit of the idea or concept. 
Phase II further develops the proposed concept, with a goal of working 
toward the commercial launch of the new product, process, or service 
being developed.
    The NSF SBIR/STTR programs request the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) approval of this clearance that will allow the programs to 
collect information from a selected group of applicants--those that 
have been reviewed by independent experts and that NSF Program 
Directors are considering recommending for funding--for the purpose of 
making a funding decision. This information includes, but is not 
exclusive to, a list of company officers and the corresponding 
ownership status of each company officer within the startup,

[[Page 53003]]

whether the startup is associated or affiliated with other companies, 
whether there exist any relationships (personal, financial, and/or 
professional) between project personnel, and the locations of all the 
facilities where significant research will be performed for the 
proposed project. Such data will enable the NSF Program Directors to 
evaluate a given company's business structure, ascertain the level of 
commitment of the Principal Investigator (PI) and co-PIs to the startup 
venture, and identify conflicts of interests (if any), as part of the 
due diligence process that the programs undertake to verify there are 
no fraudulent or inappropriate business practices prior to recommending 
the small business for an award.
    Following standard OMB requirements, NSF will request OMB approval 
in advance and provide OMB with a copy of the form containing these 
questions. Data collected will be used strictly for due-diligence, 
auditing, and/or legal purposes, and are needed for effective pre-award 
management, administration, and/or program monitoring. The applicants, 
if being considered for award, will only be asked to submit a signed 
form containing their responses to the questions once for each NSF 
SBIR/STTR proposal (Phase I and II, if applicable). The data collection 
burden to the selected applicants will be limited to no more than 10 
minutes of the respondents' time in each instance. Summaries of the 
collected data are also being used to respond to queries from Congress, 
the Small Business Administration, the public, NSF's external merit 
reviewers who serve as advisors, including Committees of Visitors, 
NSF's Office of the Inspector General, and other pertinent 
stakeholders.
    Respondents: PIs listed on the NSF SBIR/STTR proposals.
    Estimated Number of Annual Respondents: 1,000.
    Frequency: Once.
    Average Time: 15 minutes.
    Estimated Total Burden Hours: 250 hours per year.

    Dated: November 20, 2025.

Reports Clearance Officer, National Science Foundation.
