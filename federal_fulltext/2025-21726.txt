Overview of This Information Collection

    Title: Entry/Immediate Delivery Application and ACE Cargo Release.
    OMB Number: 1651-0024.
    Form Number: 3461 + 3461 ALT.
    Current Actions: Revision.
    Type of Review: Revision.
    Affected Public: Businesses.
    Abstract: All items imported into the United States are subject to 
examination before entering the commerce of the United States. There 
are two procedures available to affect the release of imported 
merchandise, including ``entry'' pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1484, and 
``immediate delivery'' pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1448(b). Under both 
procedures, CBP Forms 3461, Entry/Immediate Delivery, and 3461 ALT are 
the source documents in the packages presented to Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP). The information collected on CBP Forms 3461 and 3461 
ALT allow CBP officers to verify that the information regarding the 
consignee and shipment is correct and that a bond is on file with CBP. 
CBP also uses these forms to close out the manifest and to establish 
the obligation to pay estimated duties in the time period prescribed by 
law or regulation. CBP Form 3461 is also a delivery authorization 
document and is given to the importing carrier to authorize the release 
of the merchandise.
    CBP Forms 3461 and 3461 ALT are provided for by 19 CFR 142.3, 
142.16, 141.22, and 141.24. The forms and instructions for Form 3461 
are accessible at: <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/forms?title=3461&=Apply">https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/forms?title=3461&=Apply</a>.
    Ace Cargo Release (formerly referred to as ``Simplified Entry'') is 
a program for ACE entry summary filers in which importers or brokers 
may file ACE Cargo Release data in lieu of filing the CBP Form 3461. 
This data consists of 12 required elements: importer of record; buyer 
name and address; buyer employer identification number (consignee 
number), seller name and address; manufacturer/supplier name and 
address; Harmonized Tariff Schedule 10-digit number; country of origin; 
bill of lading; house air waybill number; bill of lading issuer code; 
entry number; entry type; and estimated shipment value. There are also 
four optional data elements: the container stuffing location, 
consolidator name and address, ship to party name and address. There 
are three Global Business Identifier (GBI) identifiers available to 
filers: 20-digit Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), 9-digit Data Universal 
Numbering System (DUNS), and 13-digit Global Location Number (GLN). The 
GBI Identifiers can be inputted for any of the following parties: 
manufacturer/producer, seller shipper, exporter, distributor or 
packager. The GBI identifiers are new optional data elements that are 
being collected to better identify the legal entity that is interacting 
with CBP as well as explore opportunities to enhance supply chain 
traceability and visibility in response to the growing complexity of 
global trade. The data collected under the ACE Cargo Release program is 
intended to reduce transaction costs, expedite cargo release, and 
enhance cargo security. ACE Cargo Release filing minimizes the 
redundancy of data submitted by the filer to CBP through receiving 
carrier data from the carrier. This design allows the participants to 
file earlier in the transportation flow. Guidance on using ACE Cargo 
Release may be found at <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/trade/ace/features">http://www.cbp.gov/trade/ace/features</a>.
    It should be noted that ACE Cargo Release was previously called 
Simplified Entry.
    New Changes:
    1. Global Business Identifier (GBI): Collectively, the updates 
proposed below aim to enhance upstream supply chain traceability and 
visibility while

[[Page 55156]]

addressing the increasing complexity of global trade supply chains. All 
participation and data submitted is voluntary. Find more details about 
GBI in the 1651-0141 GBI information collection.
    [squf] The GBI Test is expanding the available supply chain entity 
party types from the original six optional parties (Manufacturer, 
Shipper, Seller, Exporter, Distributor, Packager), to include two new 
parties: ``Intermediary'' and ``Source,'' along with optional free text 
fields that will allow filers to input additional descriptions and 
information about the specific party type. These party types would be 
made available in the GBI Enrollment database as well as the Automated 
Commercial Environment Cargo Release.
    [squf] A modification within the Global Business Identifiers (GBI) 
Enrollment database will allow the trade to submit one or more of the 
unique GBI's (the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), Global Location Number 
(GLN), and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS)) for a supply chain 
entity, as opposed to all three as previously approved and announced. 
Furthermore, a related programming update will enable trade 
participants the ability to modify or change a previous enrollment, 
including updating or adding additional GBI numbers.
    [squf] CBP intends to expand the choices of identifiers available 
to filers over the duration of the Test, including those that at no 
cost to the government provide access to the underlying entity and 
product specific supply chain data associated with the identifier. This 
would enhance traceability for CBP which may translate to facilitation 
benefits and reduced industry costs. CBP has initiated programming 
requests in ACE to accommodate the intake of additional GBI identifier 
qualifiers. These changes are under development and there is no defined 
timeline for their completion. Specifically, CBP will begin by adding 
to the GBI Test the new Altana ID (ALTA) maintained by Altana 
Technologies, USG Inc. (Altana). The addition of the ALTA identifier 
alongside current and future GBI identifiers will widen participants' 
choices and allow CBP to continue to evaluate the breadth and veracity 
of entity and supply chain information embedded within different types 
of identifier solutions already being leveraged by trade industry 
traceability stewards. It will also contribute to CBP's ongoing 
exploration of how traced supply chain information may be ingested and 
operationalized for risk management and facilitation purposes. CBP will 
add any new identifiers into the collection and submit to OMB for 
approval as they are determined through a change request (Form 83-C).
    2. Russian Sanctions Executive Order 14114:
    [squf] New Data Elements are being added to comply with the Russian 
sanctions outlined in Executive Order 14114 published on December 22, 
2023. The data elements and burden are recorded in the supporting 
statement of the 1651-0NEW Russian Sanctions information collection 
package.
    3. Update to Form 3461/3461ALT Instructions: The instructions on 
the Form 3461/3461 ALT have been updated to include the new Russian 
sanctions data elements and text field boxes, as well as being updated 
to improve user experience and clarity of the form. Find a copy of the 
new form, with the changes outlined included with this package 
submission as supplementary documents.
