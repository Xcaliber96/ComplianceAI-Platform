Overview of This Information Collection

    1. Type of Information Collection: Revision of a previously 
approved collection.
    2. The Title of the Form/Collection: United States Victims of State 
Sponsored Terrorism Fund Application.
    3. The agency form number, if any, and the applicable component of 
the Department sponsoring the collection: OMB #1123-0013 DOJ Component: 
Criminal Division.
    4. Affected public who will be asked or required to respond, as 
well as a brief abstract: The USVSST Fund was established to provide 
compensation to certain individuals who were injured as a result of 
acts of international terrorism by a state sponsor of terrorism. Under 
the Justice for United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act 
(Act), 34 U.S.C. 20144(c), as amended, an eligible claimant is (1) a 
U.S. person, as defined in 34 U.S.C. 20144(j)(8), with a final judgment 
issued by a U.S. district court under state or federal law against a 
state sponsor of terrorism and arising from an act of international 
terrorism, for which the foreign state was found not immune under 
provisions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, codified at 28 
U.S.C. 1605A or 1605(a)(7) (as such section was in effect on January 
27, 2008); (2) a U.S. person, as defined in 34 U.S.C. 20144(j)(8), who 
was taken and held hostage from the United States Embassy in Tehran, 
Iran, during the period beginning November 4, 1979, and ending January 
20, 1981; or the spouse and child of that U.S. person at that time, who 
is also identified as a

member of the proposed class in case number 1:00-CV-03110 (EGS) of the 
United States District Court for the District of Columbia; or (3) the 
personal representative of a deceased individual in either of those two 
categories.
    The information collected from the USVSST Fund's Application Form 
will be used to determine whether applicants are eligible for 
compensation from the USVSST Fund, and if so, the amount of 
compensation to be awarded. The Application Form consists of parts 
related to eligibility and compensation. The eligibility parts seek the 
information required by the Act to determine whether a claimant is 
eligible for payment from the USVSST Fund, including information 
related to participation in federal lawsuits against a state sponsor of 
terrorism under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The compensation 
parts seek the information required by the Act, as amended, to 
determine the amount of compensation for which the claimant is 
eligible. Specifically, the compensation parts seek information 
regarding the amount of compensatory damages awarded the claimant in a 
final judgment as well as any payments from sources other than the 
USVSST Fund, as defined in 34 U.S.C. 20144(j)(6), that the claimant 
received, is entitled to receive, or is scheduled to receive, as a 
result of the act of international terrorism by a state sponsor of 
terrorism. The information collected will also help ensure the USVSST 
Fund does not provide compensation to individuals who are criminally 
culpable for an act of international terrorism, in accordance with 
section 20144(h) of the Act.
    5. Obligation to Respond: Required to obtain a benefit.
    6. Total Estimated Number of Respondents: Approximately 2,000.
    7. Estimated Time per Respondent: 1.0 hours.
    8. Frequency: Once.
