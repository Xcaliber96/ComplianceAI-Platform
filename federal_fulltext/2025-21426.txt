Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam 
Electric Power Generating Point Source Category--Initial Notification 
Date Extension; Withdrawal of Direct Final Rule

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

ACTION: Withdrawal of direct final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: Because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
received adverse comment, it is withdrawing the direct final rule 
entitled, ``Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam 
Electric Power Generating Point Source Category--Initial Notification 
Date Extension,'' published in the Federal Register on October 2, 2025.

DATES: Effective November 28, 2025, the EPA withdraws the direct final 
rule published at 90 FR 47617, on October 2, 2025.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard Benware, Engineering and 
Analysis Division Office of Water (Mail Code 4303T), Environmental 
Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20460; 
telephone number: (202) 566-1369; email address:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Because the EPA received adverse comment, 
the Agency is withdrawing the direct final rule entitled, ``Effluent 
Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power 
Generating Point Source Category--Initial Notification Date 
Extension,'' published on October 2, 2025 (90 FR 47617). The EPA stated 
in that direct final rule that if it received adverse comment by 
November 3, 2025, the direct final rule would not take effect, and the 
EPA would publish a timely withdrawal in the Federal Register. Because 
the EPA subsequently received adverse comment on that direct final 
rule, it is withdrawing the direct final rule.
    The EPA published a companion proposed rule on the same day as the 
direct final rule (90 FR 47693). The proposed rule invited comment on 
the substance of the direct final rule (as well as on additional 
subjects). The EPA will address those comments in a subsequent final 
action, which will be based on the companion proposed rule. As stated 
in the direct final rule and the companion proposed rule, the EPA will 
not institute a second comment period on this subject.

List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 423

    Environmental protection, Electric power generation, Power 
facilities, Waste treatment and disposal, Water pollution control.

Administrator.
