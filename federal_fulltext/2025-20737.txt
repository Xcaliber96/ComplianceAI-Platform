SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    Pursuant to section 805 of title VIII of the Tariff Act of 1930 
(the Softwood Lumber Act of 2008), the Secretary of Commerce is 
mandated to submit to the appropriate Congressional committees a report 
every 180 days on any subsidy provided by countries exporting softwood 
lumber or softwood lumber products to the United States, including 
stumpage subsidies. Commerce submitted its last subsidy report to the 
Congress on July 17, 2025.

Request for Comments

    Given the large number of countries that export softwood lumber and 
softwood lumber products to the United States, we are soliciting public 
comment only on subsidies provided by countries which had exports 
accounting for at least one percent of total U.S. imports of softwood 
lumber by quantity, as classified under Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (HTSUS) subheadings 4407.1100, 4407.1200, 4407.1300, 
4407.1400, and 4407.1900, during the period January 1, 2025, through 
June 30, 2025. Official U.S. import data, published by the United 
States International Trade Commission's DataWeb, indicate that six 
countries (Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Germany, and Sweden) 
exported softwood lumber to the United States during that time period 
in amounts sufficient to account for at least one percent of U.S. 
imports of softwood lumber products. We intend to rely on similar six-
month periods to identify the countries subject to future reports on 
softwood lumber subsidies. For example, we intend to rely on U.S. 
imports of softwood lumber and softwood lumber products during the 
period July 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025, to select the countries 
subject for the next report.
    Under U.S. trade law, a subsidy exists where an authority: (i) 
provides a financial contribution; (ii) provides any form of income or 
price support within the meaning of Article XVI of the General 
Agreements on Tariffs and Trade 1994; or (iii) makes a payment to a 
funding mechanism to provide a financial contribution to a person, or 
entrusts or directs a private entity to make a financial contribution, 
if providing the contribution would normally be vested in the 
government and the practice does not differ in substance from practices 
normally followed by governments, and a benefit is thereby 
conferred.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See section 771(5)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Parties should include in their comments: (1) the country which 
provided the subsidy; (2) the name of the subsidy program; (3) a brief 
description (no more than 3-4 sentences) of the subsidy program; and 
(4) the government body or authority that provided the subsidy.

    Dated: November 19, 2025.

Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy and Negotiations, performing the 
non-exclusive functions and duties of the Assistant Secretary for 
Enforcement and Compliance.
