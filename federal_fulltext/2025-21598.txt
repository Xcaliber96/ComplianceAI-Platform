[Docket No. NHTSA-2025-0017]


Agency Information Collection Activities; Submission to the 
Office of Management and Budget for Review and Approval; Request for 
Comment; Assessing the Fit and Comfort of Motorcycle Safety Gear

AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 
Department of Transportation (DOT).

ACTION: Notice and request for public comments on a request for 
approval of a new information collection.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), 
this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) 
abstracted below will be submitted to the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) for review and approval. The ICR describes the nature of 
the information collection and its expected burden. NHTSA is seeking 
approval for a new, one-time information collection from a targeted 
sample of 625 motorcycle riders (from 1,250 screened for potential 
participations) about their use and preference for motorcycle 
protective gear including footwear, gloves, helmets, jackets, and 
pants. The collection will involve recruiting motorcyclists attending 
motorcycle events to gather information about their perceptions of the 
gear in terms of comfort, usability, and protective value, and to 
obtain objective measures of fit. The study will allow NHTSA to assess 
the relationship between perceived and objectively measured fit and 
understand rider beliefs about the protective value of gear that 
influence the selection and use of protective gear. Participation will 
be voluntary and anonymous. A Federal Register notice with a 60-day 
comment period soliciting comments on the following information 
collection was published on January 13, 2025. NHTSA received five 
comments, which we address below.

DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 31, 2025.

ADDRESSES: Written comments and recommendations for the proposed 
information collection, including suggestions for reducing burden, 
should be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget at 
<a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a>. To find this particular information 
collection, select ``Currently under Review--Open for Public Comment''

    Summary of the Collection of Information:
    NHTSA is seeking approval for a new, one-time information 
collection from a targeted sample of 625 motorcycle riders (from 1,250 
screened for potential participation) about their use and preference 
for motorcycle protective gear. The information collection will involve 
recruiting motorcyclists attending motorcycle events to ask them for 
their perceptions about the protective gear they are wearing (including 
footwear, gloves, helmets, jackets, pants) and to obtain objective 
measures of fit. The study will allow NHTSA to assess the relationship 
between perceived and objectively measured fit, rider beliefs about the 
protective value of gear, and factors influencing the selection and use 
of protective gear.
    Potential participants will be recruited at locations where riders 
gather, such as rallies, training events, and other organized social 
events. The study protocol calls for the recruitment of an equal number 
of riders of standard, cruiser, sport and adventure/touring 
motorcycles, and seated motor scooters. Depending on the venue, the 
study team will either invite riders to participate at a study tent or 
conduct the survey near the rider's motorcycle. Study staff will 
observe gear worn by riders, assess the fit of the gear, and ask riders 
for their opinions about the fit and comfort of the gear. Data 
collection will involve the use of a portable tablet for the informed 
consent process, and to record participant responses and staff 
observations. Participants will self-administer some portions of the 
survey, while data collectors will verbally ask the participants about 
their gear during the gear assessments. Anthropometric measurements 
(e.g., head circumference) will be taken using ribbon tape or an 
anthropometer as appropriate depending on the gear type being assessed.
    The study plan is to assess one type of protective gear (e.g., 
jackets) per participant. Additionally, to obtain information on 
participants' perspectives of different types of protective gear, study 
staff will present images on a tablet of the protective gear (one gear 
type per participant) that ranges in quality. The images will include 
product descriptions, but no brand names. Participants will be asked to 
rate the protection afforded by the gear, its quality, and the 
likelihood of wearing or purchasing it.
    Participation will be voluntary and anonymous. This information 
collection only requires participants to report their answers; there 
are no record-keeping costs to the participants. NHTSA will use the 
information to produce a technical report that will present summary 
statistics and tables; a de-identified data set will also be made 
available to the public. Participants will not report personally 
identifiable information. The study will allow NHTSA to better 
understand how the fit and comfort of protective gear influences rider 
choices to use or not use protective gear and provide the means to 
assess how well gear is fitting riders. This information will aid NHTSA 
in its efforts to develop successful programs to improve motorcyclist 
safety. The technical report will be distributed to a variety of 
audiences interested in improving highway safety.
    Description of the Need for the Information and Proposed Use of the 
Information:
    NHTSA's statutory mandate is to reduce deaths, injuries, and 
economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes on the Nation's 
highways. The agency develops, promotes, and implements educational, 
engineering, and enforcement programs with the goal of ending 
preventable tragedies and reducing economic costs associated with 
vehicle use and highway travel. As part of its mandate, NHTSA is 
authorized to conduct research to develop traffic safety programs. 
Title 23, United States Code, Chapter 4, Section 403 authorizes the 
Secretary of Transportation to conduct research and development 
activities. Pursuant to Section 1.95 of Title 49 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR), the Secretary has delegated this authority to NHTSA. 
Current data is essential to develop appropriate approaches to improve 
traffic safety. This is especially true for information on 
motorcyclists, where data is much more limited.
    NHTSA and other traffic safety stakeholders have sought to learn 
about motorcycle safety issues through varied methodological 
approaches. In 2022, there were 6,218 motorcyclists killed in traffic 
crashes, comprising 15 percent of all traffic fatalities that year and 
representing a fatality rate per vehicle miles traveled of 26.16, 
nearly 22 times that of passenger car occupants (1.20).\1\ These 
findings demonstrate the inherent risk of motorcycle riding and 
highlight the importance of wearing personal protective gear, 
especially a helmet, but including footwear, gloves, jacket, and pants. 
Nonetheless, not all motorcyclists use gear on every ride.

    The proposed study aims to address the pressing need to understand 
the relationship between the fit and comfort of personal protective 
gear and the decision to use gear. The results will assist NHTSA in the 
development of programs aimed at increasing motorcycle safety by 
providing information on the types of gear being used, how fit and 
comfortable the gear is, and deterrents to using protective gear.
    60-Day Notice: A Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period soliciting public comments on the following information 
collection was published on January 13, 2025 (90 FR 7, pp. 2779-2781). 
Five comments were received during the comment period. We address these 
comments below.
    One motorcyclist expressed concern over exclusively collecting data 
at motorcycle rallies, as the attendance tends to be largely uniform 
and suggested broadening beyond rallies ``to ensure that all riders . . 
. can be equally protected.'' The current recruitment approach does not 
focus only on motorcycle rallies. The recruitment plan considers 
recruiting potential participants from locations other than motorcycle 
rallies such as training events and other organized events. As such, 
the project scope already intends on collecting data from motorcyclists 
at locations other than rallies.
    An anonymous commenter expressed support for this project and 
recommended the study explore how motorcycle protective gear has 
reduced injuries in motorcycle crashes. NHTSA declines to expand its 
study to explore crashes because it is beyond the scope of the current 
study.
    NHTSA received three comments in support of the study. One 
commenter stated the study will address ``one of the most used 
excuses'' to not wear protective gear. Another commenter expressed 
being ``so grateful for this amazing step forward for protecting our 
motorcyclists.'' A last commenter ``appreciates the initiative of NHTSA 
in proposing this study to gain greater insight into the decisions of 
motorcycle riders to use protective equipment.''
    Affected Public: This study will recruit volunteers who are riders 
of selected types of motorcycles (standard,

[[Page 55239]]

cruiser, sport, adventure/touring and seated motor scooter) at the data 
collection locations. Motorcyclists passing by the data collection 
locations will be recruited to voluntarily participate in an assessment 
of the fit of their current protective gear (if worn). They will also 
be asked to review images of selected protective gear and provide their 
opinions on the protective gears' protective capabilities, usability, 
and perceived quality.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: Participation in this study will 
be voluntary and anonymous. The study expects to contact approximately 
1,250 motorcyclists at the data collection locations to obtain 
responses from 625 motorcyclists (125 from each motorcycle type).
    Frequency: This study will be a one-time data collection. Because 
data collection may occur at multiple events, there is a remote chance 
an individual could participate more than once. This is not expected, 
however, as potential participants will not know data collection 
locations or times.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: The total amount of burden is 
estimated to be 341 hours. This includes the following estimates: (1) 
313 hours for 625 motorcyclists to respond fully to the survey, based 
on an average completion time of 30 minutes per participant; (2) 19 
hours for the estimated 75 motorcyclists who will partially 
participate, based on spending 15 minutes on a portion of the survey; 
and (3) nine hours for the estimated 550 people who are screened by 
study staff, but decline to participate, based on one minute per 
interaction (see Table 1).
