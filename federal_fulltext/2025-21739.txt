Agencies (SSOAs) direct Rail Transit Agencies (RTAs) within their 
jurisdiction to identify hazards related to rail trespassing and 
suicide events, perform safety risk assessments, identify safety risk

trespassing and suicide events, and utilize safety performance 
monitoring and measurement procedures to assess the effectiveness of 
mitigations. FTA recommends SSOAs obtain any documentation related to 
the recommended actions outlined above from their RTAs. FTA recommends

Safety Oversight Reporting (SSOR) system within 180 days from the
