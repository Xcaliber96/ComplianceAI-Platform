    Proposed Collection Title: Information Program on Clinical Trials: 
Maintaining a Registry and Results Databank, 0925-0586, Expiration 
Date: 03/31/2026, Extension, National Library of Medicine (NLM), 
National Institutes of Health (NIH).
    Need and Use of Information Collection: The National Institutes of 
Health operates <a href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, which was established as a clinical 
trial registry under section 113 of the Food and Drug Administration 
Modernization Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-115) and was expanded to include 
a results data bank by Title VIII of the Food and Drug Administration 
Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) and by the Clinical Trials Registration 
and Results Information Submission regulations at 42 CFR part 11. 
<a href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> collects registration and results information for 
clinical trials and other types of clinical studies (e.g., 
observational studies and patient registries) with the objectives of 
enhancing patient enrollment and providing a mechanism for tracking 
subsequent progress of clinical studies to the benefit of public 
health. It is widely used by patients, physicians, and medical 
researchers; in particular those involved in clinical research. While 
many clinical studies are registered and submit results information 
voluntarily, 42 CFR part 11 requires the registration of certain 
applicable clinical trials of drug, biological, and device products and 
the submission of results information for completed applicable clinical 
trials of drug, biological, and device products whether or not they are 
approved, licensed, or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration.
    OMB approval is requested for 3 years. There are no costs to 
respondents other than their time. The total estimated annualized 
burden hours are 1,411,181.
