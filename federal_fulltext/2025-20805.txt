SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Clearance for A-11 Section 280 Improving Customer Experience 
Information Collection.
    OMB Control Number: 2900-0876 <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRASearch">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRASearch</a>.
    Type of Review: ICR Revision.
    Abstract: This ICR Revision seeks to extend the expiration date 
that currently expires in February 2026, and increase the burden hours 
associated with the Department of Veterans Affairs customer experience 
data collection system from 344,083 to 504,982, and the number of 
responses from 4,012,000 to 5,942,778. VA, when it last revised 
Clearance for A-11 Section 280 Improving Customer Experience 
Information Collection, calculated total the burden needed based on the 
number of Customer Satisfaction surveys under management (141 in 
calendar year 2022) and our informed estimate of growth in number of 
surveys under management. As a result of unexpectedly strong and robust 
need (and corresponding requests) for new customer experience surveys 
by VA customers (stakeholders and partners), VA has already reached 176 
surveys under management and anticipate reaching 200 by the end of 
Fiscal Year 2027. This anticipated growth and per our models for growth 
from now until our current ICR expires in February 2025, directly 
translates into a corresponding need for an increase in associated 
burden hours from 344,083 to 504,982, and the number of responses from 
4,012,000 to 5,942,778, to accommodate the current and future demand.

General Background on Our Customer Experience Data Collection Listening 
Tools

    Whether seeking a loan, Social Security benefits, Veterans 
benefits, or other services provided by the Federal Government, 
individuals and businesses expect Government customer services to be 
efficient and intuitive, just like services from leading private-sector 
organizations. Yet according to research, government services continue 
to lag behind the private sector in customer satisfaction and 
experience quality. A modern, streamlined and responsive customer 
experience means: Raising government-wide customer experience to the 
average of the private sector service industry; developing indicators 
for high-impact Federal programs to monitor progress towards excellent 
customer experience and mature digital services; and providing the 
structure (including increasing transparency) and resources to ensure 
customer experience is a focal point for agency leadership. To support 
this, OMB Circular A-11 Section 280 established government-wide 
standards for mature customer experience organizations in government 
and measurement. To enable Federal programs to deliver the experience 
taxpayers deserve, they must undertake three general categories of 
activities: Conduct ongoing customer research, gather and share 
customer feedback, and test services and digital products.
    These data collection efforts may be either qualitative or 
quantitative in nature or may consist of mixed methods. Additionally, 
data may be collected via a variety of means, including but not limited 
to electronic or social media, direct or indirect observation (i.e., in 
person, video and audio collections), interviews, questionnaires, 
surveys, and focus groups. Veterans Experience Office will limit its 
inquiries to data collections that solicit strictly voluntary opinions 
or responses. Steps will be taken to ensure anonymity of respondents in 
each activity covered by this request.
    The results of the data collected will be used to improve the 
delivery of Federal services and programs. It will include the creation 
of personas, customer journey maps, reports and summaries of customer 
feedback data and user insights. The Veterans Experience Office will 
collect this information by electronic means, when possible, as well as 
by mail, fax, telephone, technical discussions, and in-person 
interviews. Veterans Experience Office may also utilize observational 
techniques to collect this information.
    Collections will be targeted at the solicitation of opinions from 
respondents who have experience with the program or may have experience 
with the program in the near future. For the purposes of this request, 
customers are individuals, businesses, and organizations that interact 
with a Federal Government agency or program, either directly or via a 
federal contractor. This could include individuals or households; 
businesses or other for-profit organizations; not-for profit 
institutions; State, local or tribal governments; Federal government; 
and Universities.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. The Federal Register Notice with a 
60-day comment period soliciting comments on this collection of 
information was published at: 90 FR 43511, September 9, 2025.
    Affected Public: Individuals or Households.
    Estimated Annual Burden: 504,982.
    Estimated Average Burden per Respondent: Varied, dependent upon the 
data collection method used. The possible response time to complete a 
questionnaire or survey may be 2 minutes or up to 2 hours to 
participate in an interview.
    Frequency of Response: Varied, dependent upon the data collection 
method used.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 5,942,778.
