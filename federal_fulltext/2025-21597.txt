Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal 
Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; Extension of an 
Alternative Closure Requirement Deadline

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

ACTION: Proposed rule; notice of public hearing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is 
proposing to extend, by three years, one compliance deadline applicable 
to certain coal combustion residuals (CCR) surface impoundments 
operating pursuant to the alternative closure requirements. 
Specifically, EPA is extending the deadline for owners and operators to 
complete closure of their unlined CCR surface impoundments larger than 
40 acres from October 17, 2028, to October 17, 2031. This deadline 
extension will promote electric grid reliability by allowing a subset 
of coal-fired power producers to continue to operate beyond their 
currently scheduled retirement date.

B. Notice of Public Hearing

    EPA is providing the minimum required 30-days' notice of this 
public hearing. EPA evaluated the complexity and technical nature of 
this proposed rule. The scope of this action is limited to extending 
one compliance deadline applicable to certain CCR surface impoundments 
operating pursuant to the alternative closure requirements. EPA 
determined this issue is not complex or highly technical and therefore 
30 days' notice of the public hearing for this proposed rule was 
adequate to provide the public with meaningful opportunity to comment 
on the regulatory change.

C. Public Hearing

    EPA will hold a virtual public hearing on January 6, 2026. The 
hearing will convene at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) and conclude at 
1:00 p.m. (ET).
    EPA will begin pre-registering speakers for the virtual public 
hearing upon publication of this document in the Federal Register. To 
register to speak at the hearing, please use the online registration 
form available on EPA's CCR website <a href="https://www.epa.gov/coal-combustion-residuals">https://www.epa.gov/coal-combustion-residuals</a> or contact the person listed in the FOR FURTHER 
INFORMATION CONTACT section to register to speak at the hearing. Both 
virtual hearing speakers and attendees are requested to pre-register at 
the link provided above. The last day to pre-register to speak at the 
hearing will be January 2, 2026.
    EPA will make every effort to follow the schedule as closely as 
possible on the day of the hearing; however, please plan for the 
hearings to run either ahead of schedule or behind schedule.

II. General Information

A. Does this action apply to me?

    This proposed rule may be of interest to electric utilities and 
independent power producers that fall within the North American 
Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 221112 and that submitted a 
complete demonstration pursuant to section 257.103(f)(2). The following 
eleven power plants are currently operating unlined CCR surface 
impoundments larger than 40 acres under a pending demonstration: 
Baldwin Power Station (IL), Big Cajun II Power Plant (LA), Brame Energy 
Center (LA), Coleto Creek Power Plant (TX), Intermountain Generating 
Facility (UT), Kincaid Power Station (IL), Miami Fort Power Station 
(OH), Naughton Power Plant (WY), Newton Power Station (IL), R.M. 
Schahfer Generating Station (IN), and Welsh Power Plant (TX). To 
determine whether your entity is regulated by this action, you should 
carefully examine the applicability criteria found in section 257.50 of 
title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\1\ If you have 
questions regarding the applicability of this action to a particular 
entity, consult the persons listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION 
CONTACT section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Unless otherwise stated, all citations specified in this 
action are found in title 40 of the CFR.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. What action is the Agency taking?

    This proposed rule extends one compliance deadline applicable to 
certain impoundments currently operating pursuant to the alternative 
closure requirements under section 257.103(f)(2). Specifically, EPA is 
extending the existing deadline for owners and operators to complete 
closure of their unlined CCR surface impoundments larger than 40 acres 
from October 17, 2028, to October 17, 2031. See section 
257.103(f)(2)(iv)(B). This deadline extension will promote electric 
grid reliability by allowing the coal-fired steam generating units at 
these facilities to continue to operate beyond their currently 
scheduled retirement dates.

C. What is the Agency's authority for taking this action?

    EPA is publishing this rulemaking under the authority of sections 
1008(a)(3), 2002(a), 4004, and 4005(a), (d) of the Solid Waste Disposal 
Act of 1965, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
of 1976 (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments 
of 1984 and the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) 
Act of 2016, 42 U.S.C. 6907(a), 6912(a), 6944, 6945(a) and (d).

D. What are the incremental costs and benefits of this proposed rule?

    EPA establishes the requirements under RCRA sections 1008(a)(3) and 
4004(a) without taking cost into account. See Utility Solid Waste 
Activities Group, et al. v. EPA (USWAG) 901 F.3d 414, 448-49 (D.C. Cir. 
2018). The following cost estimates are

[[Page 54613]]

presented in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) and summarized in 
this preamble for compliance with E.O. 12866 and consistent with OMB 
Circular A-4.
    The RIA estimates that the annualized cost savings of this proposed 
rule will be approximately $7-12 million per year when discounting at 
3%. The RIA estimates that the annualized cost savings of this action 
will be approximately $17-27 million per year when discounting at 7%. 
Further information on the economic effects of this action can be found 
in Unit V of this preamble. EPA also qualitatively considered the grid 
reliability and air emissions impacts of this proposed rule. Further 
details can be found in section V of the preamble.

III. Background

A. Summary of the Alternative Closure Requirements Under Section 
257.103(f)

    In April 2015, EPA issued its first set of regulations establishing 
requirements for CCR surface impoundments and landfills. ``Hazardous 
and Solid Waste Management System; Disposal of Coal Combustion 
Residuals From Electric Utilities,'' (2015 CCR Rule) 80 FR 21302 (Apr. 
17, 2015). These requirements included criteria consisting of location 
restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and 
corrective action requirements, closure and post-closure care 
requirements, recordkeeping, notification, and internet posting 
requirements. The closure criteria included alternative closure 
provisions under section 257.103. See 80 FR 21423-24.
    In August 2020, EPA issued revisions to that rule, including 
revisions to the alternative closure requirements. ``Hazardous and 
Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals 
From Electric Utilities; A Holistic Approach to Closure Part A: 
Deadline to Initiate Closure rule,'' 85 FR 53516 (Aug. 28, 2020) (the 
``Part A Rule''). The Part A Rule established April 11, 2021, as the 
date that electric utilities must cease placing waste into all unlined 
CCR surface impoundments. The Part A Rule also revised the alternative 
closure provisions of the CCR regulations (section 257.103) by allowing 
owners or operators to request an extension to continue to receive CCR 
and/or non-CCR waste streams in unlined CCR surface impoundments after 
April 11, 2021, provided that certain criteria are met. EPA established 
two site-specific alternatives to initiate closure of unlined CCR 
surface impoundments (section 257.103(f)), commonly known as extensions 
of the date to cease receipt of waste.
    The first alternative is for a facility that must continue to use 
an unlined CCR surface impoundment after April 11, 2021, because no 
alternative disposal capacity is available either on-site or off-site, 
and it was technically infeasible to develop alternative capacity by 
that date. Section 257.103(f)(1) (titled Development of Alternative 
Capacity is Technically Infeasible). The second alternative is for 
coal-fired boiler(s) that are going to permanently shut down by a date 
certain after April 11, 2021, but there is no alternative capacity 
either on- or off-site that is available to accept the CCR and non-CCR 
waste streams between April 11, 2021, and the permanent closure date of 
the coal-fired boiler. Section 257.103(f)(2) (titled Permanent 
Cessation of Coal-Fired Boiler(s) by a Date Certain). This proposed 
rule only pertains to the second alternative because facilities 
operating under the first alternative have all already obtained 
alternative disposal capacity, thus allowing continued use of 
associated coal-fired boilers. Section 257.103(f)(2) establishes 
deadlines for when the facility must both cease operation of its coal-
fired boiler and complete closure of the unlined surface impoundment. 
The existing deadlines are based on the size of the impoundment, using 
surface area as a surrogate for impoundment size. For impoundments that 
are 40 acres or smaller, owners and operators were required to cease 
operation of the coal-fired boiler and complete closure of the 
impoundment no later than October 17, 2023. For impoundments that are 
larger than 40 acres, the deadline is October 17, 2028. See section 
257.103(f)(2)(iv).
    As provided in section 257.103(f)(3)(i), November 30, 2020, was the 
deadline for facilities to submit requests to EPA to operate an unlined 
impoundment beyond April 11, 2021, pursuant to section 257.103(f)(2). 
As discussed in Unit IV of this preamble, this action is not revising 
the November 30, 2020, deadline to allow additional owners and 
operators to submit new time extension requests. EPA received 23 
complete extension requests under section 257.103(f)(2) before the 
November 30, 2020, deadline, including seven facility requests with 
impoundments that are 40 acres or smaller and 16 facility requests with 
impoundments larger than 40 acres.\2\ Of the 16 extension requests with 
impoundments larger than 40 acres, 11 facilities are currently 
operating these impoundments pursuant to section 257.103(f)(2). EPA has 
not yet taken action to determine whether to grant these 11 extension 
requests.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ EPA issued letters of completeness on January 11, 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Facilities Currently Operating Impoundments Under Section 
257.103(f)(2)

    Eleven power plants are currently operating at least one unlined 
CCR surface impoundment under a pending extension request submitted 
pursuant to section 257.103(f)(2). EPA below summarizes information 
about these impoundments and the coal-fired steam generating units that 
rely on the continued operation of the unlined impoundments (i.e., CCR 
or non-CCR waste streams from the boilers units are being routed to the 
impoundment). The summaries are based on information presented in the 
November 2020 demonstrations prepared to support the extension request 
(2020 Demonstration) \3\ and the most recent annual progress report 
required by section 257.103(f)(2)(x), if the progress report provides 
new relevant information.\4\ The summaries below are organized by the 
electric power market in which the facility falls. Five of these 
facilities fall within the electric power market operated by the 
Midcontinent Independent System Operator, two within PJM 
Interconnection, and one facility each in Electric Reliability Council 
of Texas, Northwest, Southwest, and Southwest Power Pool.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Demonstrations supporting the extension requests can be 
accessed on each facility's publicly accessible CCR website. EPA's 
website includes a list of publicly accessible internet sites at 
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/coal-combustion-residuals">https://www.epa.gov/coal-combustion-residuals</a>.
    \4\ The annual progress report documents the continued lack of 
alternative disposal capacity and the progress towards the closure 
of the CCR surface impoundment(s) covered by the extension request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO)
    <bullet> Baldwin Power Station (Baldwin) located in Illinois. 
According to the 2020 Demonstration submitted by Dynegy Midwest 
Generation LLC (Dynegy), Baldwin is a 1,185 megawatt (MW) coal-fired 
electric generating station located near Baldwin, Illinois. The unlined 
CCR surface impoundment operating pursuant to the extension request is 
the Bottom Ash Pond. The time frames discussed in the 2020 
Demonstration stated that the two coal-fired boilers (Units 1 and 2) 
would cease operations no later than December 31, 2025. Furthermore, 
Baldwin anticipated that all CCR and non-CCR waste streams going to the 
Bottom Ash Pond would cease by July 17, 2027, and closure of

[[Page 54614]]

the impoundment would be completed by October 17, 2028. On April 2, 
2025, Dynegy submitted an update to the closure schedule and closure 
plan (Baldwin Update) associated with its 2020 Demonstration. In the 
Baldwin Update, Dynegy stated that Units 1 and 2 will continue to 
operate for up to an additional two years to no later than December 31, 
2027, due to ``recent reliability and market conditions in MISO.'' \5\ 
Dynegy further stated in this update that closure of the Bottom Ash 
Pond would still be completed by October 17, 2028 (same as stated in 
2020 Demonstration) because closure has already begun and is being 
conducted in two phases starting in 2025.

``Comments from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. 
regarding the Baldwin Energy Station adjusted retirement date and 
the need to maintain existing generation for reliability'' dated 
December 18, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Big Cajun II Power Plant (Big Cajun II) located in 
Louisiana. In November 2020, Cleco Cajun LLC (Cleco) submitted an 
extension request for the unlined Bottom Ash Basin located near New 
Roads, Louisiana. According to the 2020 Demonstration, the Bottom Ash 
Basin receives CCR (bottom ash) from Unit 1, which is a 580 MW coal-
fired steam generating unit. The Bottom Ash Basin also receives other 
non-CCR waste streams (i.e., clarifier/softener underflow) from Unit 1, 
as well as from Unit 2 (a natural gas unit) and Unit 3 (a coal-fueled 
unit).\6\ Cleco stated in its 2020 Demonstration that the Unit 1 boiler 
is subject to a 2013 consent decree requiring that Unit 1 ``cease 
generation of coal-fired energy by no later than April 1, 2025.'' 
Furthermore, Big Cajun II anticipated that all waste streams going to 
the Bottom Ash Basin would cease by approximately March or April 2027, 
and closure of the impoundment will be completed by October 17, 2028. 
Given the existence of the consent decree, EPA believes that this rule 
would not allow Unit 1 to generate electricity beyond April 1, 2025; 
however, this action would allow the Bottom Ash Basin to be closed over 
a longer period should Big Cajun II need additional time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ CCR waste streams (bottom ash) from Unit 3 is dry handled 
and taken off-site.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Brame Energy Center (Brame) located in Louisiana. 
According to the 2020 Demonstration submitted by Cleco Power LLC, Brame 
operates a 523 MW coal-fired steam generating unit called Rodemacher 
Unit 2. Brame is located in Lena, Louisiana. The unlined CCR surface 
impoundment operating pursuant to the extension request is the Bottom 
Ash Pond, which receives CCR waste streams related to Rodemacher Unit 
2. The time frames discussed in the 2020 Demonstration stated that 
closure of the Bottom Ash Pond will be completed by no later than 
October 17, 2028. To meet this deadline, Cleco Power stated it plans to 
cease operation of Rodemacher Unit 2 by no later than August or 
September 2027. Brame also operates steam generating units fueled by 
natural gas (Unit 1) and petroleum coke (Unit 3); however, waste 
streams from those generating units are not disposed in the Bottom Ash 
Pond and therefore are not impacted by this rulemaking.
    <bullet> Newton Power Station (Newton) located in Illinois. In 
November 2020, Illinois Power Generating Company (IPGC) submitted an 
extension request for the unlined Primary Ash Pond located near Newton, 
Illinois. According to the 2020 Demonstration, Newton is a 615 MW steam 
electric generating facility with one coal-fired boiler. The Primary 
Ash Pond receives various CCR and non-CCR waste streams. IPGC further 
stated that it is scheduled to cease coal-fired boiler operation no 
later than July 17, 2027. On October 22, 2025, IPGC submitted an update 
to the closure schedule and closure plan (Newton Update) associated 
with its 2020 Demonstration. In the Newton Update, IPGC stated that 
Unit 1 will continue to operate for an additional six weeks to no later 
than September 1, 2027, due to ``recent reliability and market 
conditions in MISO.'' \7\ Furthermore, the schedule shows placement of 
all waste streams into Primary Ash Pond will cease by December, 2027, 
so that closure of the Primary Ash Pond will be completed by October 
17, 2028.

    <bullet> R.M. Schahfer Generating Station (RM Schahfer) located in 
Indiana. At the time Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) 
submitted the 2020 Demonstration for the Waste Disposal Area, RM 
Schahfer operated four coal-fired boilers. The Waste Disposal Area is 
an unlined CCR surface impoundment that receives CCR and non-CCR waste 
streams associated with these boilers. By October 2021, NIPSCO 
permanently retired two of the four coal-fired boilers and planned to 
retire the remaining two coal-fired boilers in 2023.\8\ As further 
explained in the 2025 Annual Update,\9\ following communications with 
MISO in 2022, ``NIPSCO identified the need to extend coal-fired 
generation at [RM Schahfer] beyond the originally planned 2023 
retirement date.'' Currently, these two coal-fired boilers are 
scheduled to cease coal-fired generation by December 31, 2025. 
Furthermore, the current schedule shows placement of all waste streams 
into the Waste Disposal Area by no later than September 2026, so that 
closure of the impoundment will be completed by October 17, 2028. The 
two operating coal-fired boilers have a combined generating capacity of 
847 MW. NIPSCO has stated that RM Schahfer would operate its coal-fired 
boilers until 2028 if the proposed rule change was finalized.

    <bullet> Kincaid Power Station (Kincaid) located in Illinois. In 
November 2020, Kincaid Generation, LLC submitted an extension request 
for the unlined Ash Pond located near Kincaid, Illinois. According to 
the 2020 Demonstration, Kincaid is a 1,108 MW steam electric generating 
facility with two coal-fired boilers. The Ash Pond receives various CCR 
and non-CCR waste streams associated with the two generating units. 
Kincaid Generation stated that the two coal-fired boilers will be 
retired no later than July 17, 2027. Furthermore, the schedule shows 
placement of all waste streams into Ash Pond will cease by September 
17, 2027, so that closure of the Ash Pond can be completed by October 
17, 2028.
    <bullet> Miami Fort Power Station (Miami Fort) located in Ohio. 
Dynegy Miami Fort, LLC (Dynegy) stated in its 2020 Demonstration that 
Miami Fort is a 1,100 MW two unit (Units 7 and 8), coal-fired steam 
electric generating station located near North Bend, Ohio. The Miami 
Fort Pond System is the unlined impoundment operating pursuant to the 
extension request and receives CCR waste streams (bottom ash and fly 
ash), as well as other non-CCR waste streams. The time frames discussed 
in the 2020 Demonstration stated that closure of the Miami Fort Pond 
System will be completed by no later than October 17, 2028. To meet 
this deadline, Dynegy plans to cease operation of boiler Units 7 and 8 
by no later than June 17, 2027, and cease placement of wastes into the 
impoundment by August 17, 2027.

    <bullet> Coleto Creek Power Plant (Coleto Creek) located in Texas. 
In November 2020, Coleto Creek Power, LLC submitted an extension 
request for the unlined Coleto Creek Primary Ash Pond located near 
Fannin, Texas. According to the 2020 Demonstration, the Primary Ash 
Pond receives CCR (bottom ash, economizer ash and mill rejects) and 
various non-CCR waste streams associated with the 650 MW coal-fired 
steam generating unit. Coleto Creek Power stated that the boiler will 
cease coal-fired operations no later than July 17, 2027. Furthermore, 
Coleto Creek anticipates that it will cease placing all waste streams 
into Primary Ash Pond by September 17, 2027, so that closure of the 
Primary Ash Pond can be completed by October 17, 2028. In its most 
recent annual progress report, Coleto Creek Power noted plans to 
convert the plant to operate on natural gas after coal-firing 
operations cease in 2027.\10\

    <bullet> J. Robert Welsh Power Plant (Welsh Plant) located in 
Texas. In November 2020, Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) 
submitted an extension request for the Primary Bottom Ash Pond at the 
Welsh Plant to allow the unlined impoundment to continue to receive CCR 
and non-CCR waste streams. The Welsh Plant is a 1,056 MW coal-fired 
steam electric generating station located in Pittsburgh, Texas. The 
time frames discussed in the 2020 Demonstration stated that closure of 
the Primary Bottom Ash Pond will be completed in two phases with the 
first phase of closure construction beginning in February 2027. The 
second phase of closure construction is planned to commence in March 
2028 and to coincide with the cessation of coal-fired boiler 
operations. Closure of the Primary Bottom Ash Pond would be completed 
by no later than October 17, 2028.

in Utah. Intermountain Power Service Corporation (IPSC) stated in its 
2020 Demonstration that Intermountain is a 1,900 MW coal-fired steam 
electric generating station located near Delta, Utah. The unlined CCR 
surface impoundments operating pursuant to the extension request are 
the Bottom Ash Basin and Waste Water Basin, both of which receive CCR 
waste streams related to the coal-fired boiler units. The time frames 
presented in the 2020 Demonstration state that closure of both unlined 
impoundments will be completed by no later than October 17, 2028. IPSC 
plans to cease operation of both coal-fired boilers by July 1, 2025, 
explaining that such plans were first announced in May 2017. IPSC 
further explains it is already ``moving forward with plans to develop 
new natural gas and hydrogen-fueled electricity generation'' at 
Intermountain. These plans were confirmed in the most recent annual 
progress report.\11\

Naughton provide approximately 380 MW of generating capacity. 
PacifiCorp states that the two coal-fired boilers will cease operation 
on December 31, 2025. The time frames discussed in the 2020 
Demonstration show that placement of CCR waste streams will permanently 
cease by September 30, 2026, in order to complete closure by the 
regulatory deadline. PacifiCorp states in its most recent annual 
progress report that Naughton is on schedule to cease operating the 
coal-fired boilers by the end of 2025.

C. Resource Adequacy Reports Issued by NERC and U.S. DOE

1. North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)
    The NERC mission is to ensure the reliability, resiliency, and 
security of the North American bulk power system (BPS). The BPS is made 
up of six regional entities \12\ that provide the NERC with data, 
narratives, and assessments to independently evaluate long-term 
reliability, recognize trends, and identify emerging issues and 
potential risks for the upcoming 10-year period. The NERC develops a 
long-term reliability assessment (LTRA) annually based on known system 
changes as of July of the current year. The NERC is subject to 
oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ The six regional entities overseen by NERC that monitor and 
enforce reliability standards for the BPS are: Midwest Reliability 
Organization (MRO), Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC), 
ReliabilityFirst (RF), SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), Texas 
Reliability Entity (Texas RE), and Western Electricity Coordinating 
Council (WECC).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Resource adequacy refers to the ability of an electricity system to 
meet the power demand of customers at all times, even during peak usage 
and potential outages. In the most recent LTRA released in December 
2024 (2024 LTRA), the NERC identified increasing resource adequacy 
challenges for the upcoming 10 years as demand growth surges and power 
generators announce retirement plans.\13\ The NERC also identified a 
substantial number of the replacement generation resources as weather 
dependent and, thus, more variable and less reliable than the resources 
they would replace.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ NERC, ``2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment, December 
2024, Updated July 15, 2025.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As part of its capacity and energy risk assessment, the 2024 LTRA 
identifies areas subject to potential future electricity supply 
shortfalls under normal and extreme weather conditions. The shortfall 
risks are categorized as ``high risk,'' ``elevated-risk'' and ``normal-
risk.'' The 11 electric utilities covered by this interim final rule 
fall in areas categorized as either elevated-risk or normal-risk. As 
stated in the 2024 LTRA, elevated-risk areas meet resource adequacy 
criteria, but analysis indicates that extreme weather conditions are 
likely to cause a shortfall in area reserves. Eight of the 11 
facilities fall within an elevated-risk area. Normal-risk areas are 
expected to have sufficient resources under a broad range of assessed 
conditions. The remaining three facilities fall within a normal-risk 
area.
    The 2024 LTRA provides a risk summary for the areas categorized 
with an elevated risk.\14\ The risks for the MISO area (5 of the 11 
facilities) were summarized as ``Uncertainty around new resource 
additions and existing generator retirements results in resource 
adequacy risks. Above-normal generator outages during extreme weather 
can result in unserved energy or load loss.'' Additionally, NERC 
determined that MISO's ``elevated risk'' classification may shift to 
``high risk'' in the 2028-2031 timeframe, depending on new resource 
additions/retirements.\15\ For the PJM area (2 of the 11 facilities), 
the risks were summarized as ``Resource additions are not keeping up 
with generator retirements and demand growth. Winter seasons replace 
summer

[[Page 54616]]

as the higher-risk periods due to generator performance and fuel supply 
issues.'' Finally, for the SPP area (1 of the 11 facilities), the risks 
were summarized as ``Potential energy shortfalls during peak summer and 
winter conditions arise from low wind conditions and natural gas fuel 
risk.''

    In July 2025, the DOE published a report titled ``Evaluating the 
Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid'' to 
evaluate U.S. electric grid reliability and security (``2025 DOE 
Report'').\16\ The report highlights significant reliability risks 
facing the nation's electrical grid due to current retirement schedules 
and insufficient incremental additions. The report concludes that, if 
current retirement schedules and incremental additions proceed as 
anticipated, most regions will face unacceptable reliability risks 
within five years and the Nation's electric power grid will be unable 
to meet expected demand for artificial intelligence, data centers, 
manufacturing, and industrialization while maintaining affordable and 
reliable access to energy. The report identifies the retirement of 
power-generating assets, particularly coal and natural gas sources, as 
exacerbating resource adequacy issues, with 104 Gigawatts of firm 
capacity slated for retirement by 2030. This capacity is not being 
replaced equivalently, posing risks of outages during unfavorable 
weather conditions for wind and solar generation. Even in the absence 
of retirements, the DOE's model predicts a significant increase in 
outage risks by 2030.

IV. Revised Deadline for Cessation of Operations and Unit Closure

A. Revision to Section 257.103(f)(2)(iv)(B)

    This rule proposes to extend the regulatory deadline for owners and 
operators that intend to cease coal-fired generation to complete the 
closure of their unlined CCR surface impoundments larger than 40 acres. 
Specifically, this deadline would be extended by three years, from 
October 17, 2028, to October 17, 2031. See revised section 
257.103(f)(2)(iv)(B). This rule change would provide regulatory 
flexibility to allow placement of CCR in the affected impoundments, and 
therefore coal-fired electricity generation, to continue at these 
facilities for up to three additional years.
    EPA is proposing this rule change in response to concerns that 
retirement of coal-fired power generating assets is exacerbating the 
resource adequacy problem. Given NERC's assessment that resource 
adequacy risk may increase in the MISO area from ``elevated'' to 
``high'' in the 2028-2031 period, the Agency is proposing a 3-year 
extension to the deadline to cease placing waste in the relevant 
impoundments. This extension would allow coal-fired generation to 
continue for up to three additional years, specifically between 2028 
and 2031 at these power plants. Furthermore, an extension of less than 
three years (e.g., one year) would not address resource adequacy 
concerns in the MISO area between 2028-2031. Currently EPA also lacks a 
basis to extend the deadline for more than three years. The Agency 
requests comment on the selected length of deadline extension and 
whether it should be shorter or longer than the proposed three years.
    This rule's proposed deadline extension is anticipated to impact 
eleven Part A Rule facilities with unlined CCR surface impoundments 
that are still operating pursuant to the alternative closure 
requirements under section 257.103(f)(2). Five of these facilities fall 
within the electric power market operated by MISO, two within PJM, and 
one facility each in ERCOT, Northwest, Southwest, and SPP. As noted in 
Section III.C., the majority (i.e., eight) of these facilities are 
located in elevated-risk regions according to the 2024 LTRA.
    This rule does not propose to revise the deadline for boiler 
cessation and unit closure applicable to CCR surface impoundments 40 
acres or smaller. Section 257.103(f)(2)(iv)(A) required the owners and 
operators of these smaller impoundments both to cease operation of the 
coal-fired boiler and complete closure of the CCR surface impoundment 
no later than October 17, 2023. All of these CCR surface impoundments 
have ceased receiving CCR and non-CCR waste streams and those 
impoundments are no longer operating pursuant to the alternative 
closure provisions under section 257.103(f)(2). Therefore, a similar 3-
year extension of the October 17, 2023, deadline would provide no 
relief.
    Based on the information presented in Unit III of this preamble, 
EPA expects that most of the facilities with a pending Part A 
demonstration would choose to continue operating their coal-fired 
boiler(s) past their current anticipated closure date. The Agency 
realizes that some facilities are unlikely to change their current 
closure timelines because they are on schedule to cease operating coal-
fired boilers in the near future (e.g., Naughton), are required to 
cease coal-fired generation by a specific date (e.g., Big Cajun II), or 
have plans to transition to generating electricity from a different 
fuel source (e.g., Intermountain, Coleto Creek). However, most 
facilities operating under a pending Part A demonstration have the 
capability of adjusting their unit closure timeframes, and EPA 
anticipates that these facilities would continue to operate during the 
proposed extended timeframe, thereby helping to mitigate potential 
resource adequacy concerns.
    Additionally, EPA notes that a separate Agency action issued under 
the Clean Water Act proposes to extend the deadline for certain coal-
fired electric generating units planning to close in the future (90 FR 
47693, October 2, 2025).\17\ If finalized as proposed this extension 
would prevent premature closure due to other forcing mechanisms like 
CWA regulatory requirements taking effect. In other words, the 11 
facilities impacted by today's proposal should be able to avail 
themselves of the 3-year extension proposed here without that timeframe 
being cut short by other retirement deadlines. EPA is not aware of 
other such broadly-applicable retirement deadlines that could 
effectively cut short the extension being proposed today, but the 
Agency requests public comment on any such complicating factors. Thus, 
EPA expects that the proposed deadline extension would directly promote 
resource adequacy by allowing most of the 11 facilities affected by 
this proposal to continue to operate for up to three additional years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ This rulemaking, proposed under the CWA, would (among other 
things) extend the date for existing steam electric power plants 
that would seek to achieve permanent cessation of coal combustion by 
December 31, 2034, to submit a notice of planned participation 
(NOPP), allowing utilities additional time to assess evolving power 
demand needed to inform operational planning and decision making.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In particular, EPA expects that extended coal-fired boiler 
operation would address resource adequacy in the electric power markets 
of MISO, SPP, and PJM. EPA estimates that continued operation of 
boilers currently slated to close would result in approximately 3,200 
MW of capacity remaining online for up to three additional years in 
MISO. This additional capacity would address nearly 10% of the 
generation capacity retirements anticipated for MISO by 2030.\18\ In 
SPP, extended operation of

[[Page 54617]]

coal-fired facilities would maintain 1,056 MW of generating capacity 
for up to three additional years, addressing about 14% of the 
anticipated capacity retirements expected by 2030.\19\ Likewise, EPA 
estimates that continued operation of the affected units in PJM would 
preserve approximately 2,200 MW of capacity for up to three additional 
years, which would offset about 13% of the anticipated retirements in 
PJM by 2030.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ According to the 2025 DOE Report, MISO is anticipated to 
experience retirement of 32,345 MW of generation capacity by 2030.
    \19\ According to the 2025 DOE Report, MISO is anticipated to 
experience retirement of 7,318 MW of generation capacity by 2030.
    \20\ According to the 2025 DOE Report, PJM is anticipated to 
experience retirement of 16,706 MW of generation capacity by 2030.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    EPA requests public comment on the potential benefits and benefits 
reductions of extending the alternative closure deadline as described 
in this action. In particular, the Agency is soliciting feedback on the 
potential for this action, if finalized, to address projected energy 
supply shortages discussed in Unit III.C of this preamble, especially 
for baseload and peak load reliability regionally. The Agency 
anticipates that the additional flexibility created by allowing 
operators subject to the provisions of section 257.103(f)(2)(iv)(B) 
will result in extended operation of the associated coal-fired boilers 
and delay the capacity reductions described in the DOE Report. However, 
EPA requests public comment on the likelihood of this outcome, and 
specifically requests further information regarding which operators are 
likely to avail themselves of the additional three years to complete 
closure of their unlined surface impoundment(s).
    EPA also requests public input on the accuracy and recency of 
information presented in Unit III of this preamble regarding the 
facilities potentially impacted by this action. The facility-specific 
summaries reflect the information presented in the 2020 Demonstrations 
submitted by these facilities and information in their most recent 
annual progress reports, most of which were prepared in around November 
2024, but EPA realizes that plans may have changed since these files 
were submitted and updated last.

B. Implementation Considerations of the Deadline Extension

    The existing regulations require facilities operating pursuant to a 
Part A Rule extension request to prepare an annual progress report. 
Section 257.103(f)(2)(x). The purpose of the annual progress report is 
to document the continued lack of alternative disposal capacity and the 
progress towards the closure of the CCR surface impoundment. As stated 
in the Part A Rule preamble, the annual progress report ``must include 
any delays in the anticipated cease receipt of waste date and closure 
completion date that was submitted in the demonstration materials.'' 85 
FR 53550 (Aug. 28, 2020). Because the extended deadline will not 
automatically be applied to all current extension requests, owners and 
operators that will operate pursuant to the new extended deadline 
should document that fact in their next annual progress report. Owners 
and operators are not required to resubmit to EPA an updated 
demonstration documenting the new extended deadline.
    Facilities operating CCR surface impoundments pursuant to Section 
257.103(f)(2) are currently subject to comprehensive regulations 
requiring groundwater monitoring and, where necessary, remediation of 
contaminated groundwater. These regulations detail the types of 
groundwater monitoring systems required, sampling and analysis 
requirements, detection monitoring programs, assessment monitoring 
programs, assessment of corrective measures, selection of remedies, and 
implementation of groundwater corrective action programs. See Sections 
257.90-257.98. Any facility that will operate pursuant to the new 
extended deadline in section 257.103(f)(2)(iv)(B) will continue to be 
subject to these requirements to detect releases of CCR constituents of 
concern and take action to remedy contamination when it exceeds 
established health thresholds.
    Furthermore, the regulations also required facilities to submit a 
risk mitigation plan as part of their Part A demonstration. Section 
257.103(f)(2)(v)(B). As stated in the Part A Rule, the risk mitigation 
plan describes the measures that will be taken to expedite any required 
corrective action to address any increased risk from continued 
operation of the CCR surface impoundment, which EPA will review as part 
of determining whether to grant the extension. If additional measures 
to mitigate the risk are necessary to ensure that the statutory 
standard is met, EPA will require those as a condition of granting the 
extension. 85 FR 53548.

V. The Projected Economic Impact of This Action

A. Introduction

    EPA estimated the costs and benefits of this action in a Regulatory 
Impact Analysis (RIA), which is available in the docket for this 
action.

B. Affected Universe

    The universe of facilities units and facilities affected by this 
proposed rule consists of CCR surface impoundments at coal fired 
electric utility plants that currently qualify for an extension under 
section 257.103(f)(2) based on their submission of a complete 
demonstration to EPA in compliance with the provisions of the 2020 CCR 
Part A Rule. EPA has identified 13 units at 11 facilities that may be 
affected by this proposed rule.

C. Baseline Costs

    The baseline costs of this action consist of costs related to the 
closure of CCR surface impoundments in accordance with the requirements 
of the 2015 CCR final rule by October 17, 2028, the deadline for 
closure specified in the 2020 CCR Part A Rule.

D. Costs and Benefits of This Proposed Rule

    This proposed rule is expected to result in cost savings from time 
value of money impacts (i.e., the value of delaying expenses) from 
conducting closure activities later than those activities would have 
otherwise occurred. Affected units will now be able to complete closure 
by October 17, 2031, an extension of 3 years. The estimated annualized 
cost savings attributable to this proposed rule are approximately $7-12 
million per year when discounting at 3% and $17-27 million per year 
when discounting at 7%.
    EPA also considered, but did not quantify, the potential effects of 
this proposed rule on grid reliability and air emissions. This action 
would enhance grid reliability by allowing a subset of coal-fired 
boilers to continue to operate beyond their currently scheduled 
retirement date. For a discussion of the potentially affected 
facilities and electric power markets see section III.B of the 
preamble. EPA expects the impact of this proposed rule on air emissions 
to be marginal because the number of potentially affected facilities 
who would be eligible for the extension and able to burn coal for an 
additional three years represents a small subset of the overall fleet 
of coal-fired generating units in the United States. Additional details 
can be found in the RIA for this action.

VI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

    Additional information about these statutes and Executive Orders 
can be found at <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/laws-and-executive-orders">https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/laws-and-executive-orders</a>.

[[Page 54618]]

A. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review and Executive 
Order 13563: Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review

    This action is a significant regulatory action as defined under 
section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, it was submitted 
to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Any changes 
made in response to E.O. 12866 review have been documented in the 
docket. The EPA prepared an analysis of the potential costs and 
benefits associated with this action. This analysis, ``Regulatory 
Impact Analysis: Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal 
of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities; Extension of an 
Alternative Closure Requirement Deadline,'' is available in the docket 
and is briefly summarized in Unit V of this preamble.

B. Executive Order 14192: Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation

    This action is expected to be an Executive Order 14192 deregulatory 
action. Details on the estimated cost savings of this proposed rule can 
be found in EPA's analysis of the potential costs and benefits 
associated with this action.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)

    This action does not impose any new information collection burden 
under the PRA. An Information Collection Request covering the 
information collection activities contained in the existing Disposal of 
Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities ICR has been 
submitted for OMB's approval under the temporary OMB control number 
2050-0223.

D. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)

    I certify that this action will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the RFA. In 
making this determination, EPA concludes that the impact of concern for 
this rule is any significant adverse economic impact on small entities 
and that the Agency is certifying that this rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
because the rule relieves regulatory burden on the small entities 
subject to the rule. The proposed rule does not change current 
regulatory burdens, but rather just extends the timeline necessary to 
meet them, which should reduce impacts on all affected facilities. The 
rule relieves burden by extending the deadline for owners and operators 
of coal boilers operating under a Part A demonstration to cease 
operation and close their unlined CCR surface impoundment. This delay 
affords all entities, including small entities, more time to comply, 
and reduces compliance costs by pushing them into the future. We have 
therefore concluded that this action will relieve regulatory burden for 
all directly regulated small entities.

E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA)

    This action does not contain an unfunded mandate of $100 million 
(adjusted annually for inflation) or more (in 1995 dollars) as 
described in UMRA, 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538, and does not significantly or 
uniquely affect small governments. The action imposes no enforceable 
duty on any state, local or Tribal governments or the private sector.

F. Executive Order 13132: Federalism

    This action does not have federalism implications. It will not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between 
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power 
and responsibilities among the various levels of government.

G. Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian 
Tribal Governments

    This action does not have Tribal implications as specified in 
Executive Order 13175. The rule relieves burden by extending the 
deadline for owners and operators of coal boilers operating under a 
Part A demonstration to cease operation and close their unlined CCR 
surface impoundment. This rule does not impose any additional 
requirements. Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this 
action.

H. Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children From Environmental 
Health Risks and Safety Risks

    Executive Order 13045 directs federal agencies to include an 
evaluation of the health and safety effects of the planned regulation 
on children in federal health and safety standards and explain why the 
regulation is preferable to potentially effective and reasonably 
feasible alternatives. This action is not subject to Executive Order 
13045 because the EPA does not believe the environmental health or 
safety risks addressed by this action present a disproportionate risk 
to children. The 2020 Part A final rule required all units applying for 
extensions to demonstrate full compliance with the applicable 
provisions of the 2015 final CCR rule at 40 CFR 257 subpart D, 
including all structural integrity, corrective action and other 
requirements needed to safeguard human health and the environment. 
Because all units potentially affected by this proposed rule are 
subject to a Part A extension, it is unlikely that changes in closure 
schedule under this proposed rule will have any specific impacts to 
children's health. However, EPA's Policy on Children's Health applies 
to this action. Information on how the Policy was applied is available 
under ``Children's Environmental Health'' in the Supplementary 
Information section of this preamble.

I. Executive Order 13211: Actions Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution or Use

    This action is not a ``significant energy action'' because it is 
not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, 
distribution or use of energy. This proposed rule affords certain 
facilities additional flexibility in the timing of the closure of their 
coal-fired boilers and CCR disposal unit. Assuming that these 
facilities are economically optimizing their operations, this 
additional flexibility is not expected to result in any adverse impacts 
or outcomes with regard to fuel supply or production, or energy costs. 
The proposed rule, which reduces costs on a time value of money basis, 
will not result in any adverse electricity price or energy market 
impacts.

J. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA)

    This rulemaking does not involve technical standards.
