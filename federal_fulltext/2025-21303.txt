DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION


Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA[supreg]) 
Information To Be Verified for the 2026-2027 Award Year

AGENCY: Office of Postsecondary Education, Department of Education.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: For each award year, the Secretary publishes in the Federal 
Register a notice announcing the FAFSA information that an institution 
and an applicant may be required to verify, as well as the acceptable 
documentation for verifying FAFSA information. This is the notice for 
the 2026-2027 award year; Assistance Listing Numbers 84.007, 84.033, 
84.063, and 84.268.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Vanessa Gomez. Telephone: (202) 453-
6708. Email: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e3b5828d86909082cda48c8e8699a38687cd848c95"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6335020d061010024d240c0e06192306074d040c15">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: If the Secretary selects an applicant for 
verification, the applicant's Institutional Student Information Record 
(ISIR) includes flags that indicate (1) that the applicant has been 
selected by the Secretary for verification and (2) the verification 
tracking group in which the applicant has been placed. The verification 
tracking group indicates which FAFSA information needs to be verified 
for the applicant and, if appropriate, for the applicant's parent(s) or 
spouse. The FAFSA Submission Summary indicates that the applicant's 
FAFSA information has been selected for verification and directs the 
applicant to contact the institution for further instructions for 
completing the verification process.
    In accordance with the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking 
Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act, much of the applicant's tax 
return information, including information from their spouse and/or 
parents, will come directly from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and 
will not be viewable by the student and other contributors. IRS data 
that is transferred and used in the Pell Grant eligibility 
determination and/or Student Aid Index (SAI) calculation cannot be 
edited and therefore is not subject to any verification procedures. 
When data is unable to be obtained directly from the IRS, the applicant 
will have to manually enter the necessary information into the FAFSA 
form, and that manual entry may be subject to verification.
    The following chart lists, for the 2026-2027 award year, the FAFSA 
information that an institution and an applicant and, if appropriate, 
the applicant's parent(s) or spouse may be required to verify under 34 
CFR 668.56. The chart also lists the acceptable documentation that 
must, under section 668.57, be provided to an institution for that 
information to be verified.
