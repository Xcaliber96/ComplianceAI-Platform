14 CFR Part 39

[Docket No. FAA-2025-1729; Project Identifier MCAI-2024-00568-T; 
Amendment 39-23183; AD 2025-22-05]
RIN 2120-AA64


Airworthiness Directives; Dassault Aviation Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-12-
10, which applied to certain Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X 
airplanes. AD 2022-12-10 required revising the existing airplane flight 
manual (AFM) to provide emergency procedures for inconsistent or 
unreliable flight data, emergency and abnormal operations procedures 
for the generic input/output (GEN I/O) internal module failure, and 
emergency procedures for additional information. AD 2022-12-10 also 
required revising the existing minimum equipment list (MEL) for the 
multi-function probe heating, air data, and inertial reference systems. 
Since the FAA issued AD 2022-12-10, the manufacturer developed 
modifications that fix a weak point in the avionics architecture. This 
AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-12-10 and removes 
certain airplanes from the applicability. This AD also requires 
modification of the avionics system and related revisions to the 
existing AFM and MEL. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe 
condition on these products.

DATES: This AD is effective January 2, 2026.
    The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by 
reference of a certain publication listed in this AD as of January 2, 
2026.

ADDRESSES:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 
CFR part 39 to supersede AD 2022-12-10, Amendment 39-22082 (87 FR 
45246, July 28, 2022) (AD 2022-12-10). AD 2022-12-10 applied to all 
Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes, except airplanes having 
Dassault modification M2091 embodied in production. AD 2022-12-10 
required revising the existing AFM to provide emergency procedures for 
inconsistent or unreliable flight data, emergency and abnormal 
operations procedures for the GEN I/O internal module failure, and 
emergency procedures for additional information. AD 2022-12-10 also 
required revising the operator's existing FAA-approved MEL items for 
the multi-function probe heating, air data, and inertial reference 
systems. The FAA issued AD 2022-12-10 to address misleading data on 
display units, which could reduce safety margins and lead to increased 
pilot workload, possibly resulting in reduced controllability of the 
airplane.
    The NPRM was published in the Federal Register on August 6, 2025 
(90 FR 37810). The NPRM was prompted by AD 2023-0003R1, dated September 
26, 2024 (EASA AD 2023-0003R1) (also referred to as the MCAI), issued 
by EASA, which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the 
European Union. The MCAI states that EASA superseded EASA AD 2021-0197, 
dated August 23, 2021 (which corresponds to AD 2022-12-10), with EASA 
AD 2022-0145, dated July 12, 2022 (EASA AD 2022-0145). EASA AD 2022-
0145 was issued to retain the requirements of EASA AD 2021-0197, 
exclude airplanes on which Dassault modification M2091 was embodied in 
production, and require airplane serial numbers (S/Ns) 402 and 
subsequent with the ``EASy III--2nd CERT'' or ``EASy III--3rd CERT'' 
standard to upgrade the avionics architecture to the ``EASY III--4th 
CERT'' standard (modification M2091).
    EASA AD 2022-0145, in turn, was superseded by EASA AD 2023-0003, 
dated January 6, 2023 (EASA AD 2023-0003). EASA AD 2023-0003 was issued 
to retain the requirements of EASA AD 2022-0145, exclude airplanes on 
which Dassault modification M2096 or M2097 was embodied in production, 
and require airplane S/Ns 2 through 400 inclusive to upgrade the 
avionics architecture to the ``EASy II--5th CERT'' standard 
(modification M2096 or M2097, as applicable).
    Since EASA AD 2023-0003 was issued, Dassault developed 
modifications M2055 (for airplane S/Ns 2 through 400 inclusive) and 
M2059 (for airplane S/Ns 402 and subsequent) that upgrade the avionics 
architecture to the ``EASy IV'' standard and issued Dassault Service 
Bulletin 7X-600, dated November 7, 2022; Dassault Service Bulletin 7X-
601, April 24, 2023; and Dassault Service Bulletin 7X-602, June 3, 
2023; as applicable, to provide in-service modification instructions. 
EASA AD 2023-0003 was subsequently revised by EASA AD 2023-0003R1 to 
exclude airplanes on which modifications M2055 or M2059 were embodied 
in production and allow incorporation of those modifications in service 
as an optional method of compliance for modifications M2091, M2096, or 
M2097, as applicable.
    In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to continue to require the actions in 
AD 2022-12-10 and remove from the applicability airplanes on which 
Dassault modification M2055, M2059, M2096, or M2097 were embodied in 
production. The FAA also proposed to require modification of the 
avionics system and related revisions to the existing AFM and MEL, as 
specified in

[[Page 54546]]

EASA AD 2023-0003R1. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe 
condition on these products.
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2025-1729.

Discussion of Final Airworthiness Directive

Comments

    The FAA received no comments on the NPRM or on the determination of 
the cost to the public.

Conclusion

    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority 
of another country and are approved for operation in the United States. 
Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design 
Authority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant 
data, considered any comments received, and determined that air safety 
requires adopting this AD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing 
this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Except for 
minor editorial changes, this AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. 
None of the changes will increase the economic burden on any operator.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2023-0003R1, which specifies revising the 
(1) existing AFM to provide emergency procedures for inconsistent or 
unreliable flight data and emergency and abnormal operations procedures 
for the GEN I/O internal module failure; (2) existing FAA-approved MEL 
items for the multi-function probe heating, air data, and inertial 
reference systems and modular avionic unit (MAU) #1B; and (3) 
operational suitability manual--flight crew (OSM-FC). This material 
also specifies procedures for modifying the avionics system and 
incorporating related AFM and MEL revisions.
    This material also describes optional procedures for modifying the 
avionics architecture to the ``EASy IV'' standard, revising the 
existing AFM to incorporate revision 6 or revision 25, as applicable, 
and revising the existing FAA-approved MEL to incorporate revision 16. 
Accomplishing the optional modification and AFM revision is an 
acceptable method of compliance for the applicable modification that 
upgrades the avionics architecture to ``EASy III--4th CERT'' or ``EASy 
II--5th CERT'' and related AFM revision. In addition, accomplishing the 
optional MEL revision is an acceptable method of compliance for the 
corresponding revisions to MEL items for the multi-function probe 
heating, air data, and inertial reference systems and MAU #1B.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Interim Action

    The preamble to AD 2022-12-10 specifies that the FAA considers that 
AD ``interim action'' and that the FAA might consider further 
rulemaking if a final action is identified. The manufacturer has since 
developed modifications (i.e., software upgrades) that fix a weak point 
in the avionics architecture to address the unsafe condition. The FAA 
has determined that the modifications and related AFM and MEL revisions 
should be required.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 160 airplanes of U.S. 
registry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:

                                      Estimated Costs for Required Actions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                     Cost per      Cost on U.S.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The FAA has received no definitive data on which to base the cost estimates for the parts specified in this
  AD.


                  Estimated Costs for Optional Actions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             Cost per
            Labor cost                   Parts cost           product

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    According to the manufacturer, some or all of the costs of this AD 
may be covered under warranty, thereby reducing the cost impact on 
affected individuals. The FAA does not control warranty coverage for 
affected individuals. As a result, the FAA has included all known costs 
in the cost estimate.

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, 
on the relationship between the national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various 
levels of government.

[[Page 54547]]

    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Amendment

    Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the 
Administrator, the FAA amends 14 CFR part 39 as follows:

PART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES

0
1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:

    Authority:  49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701.


Sec.  39.13   [Amended]

0
2. The FAA amends Sec.  39.13 by:
0
a. Removing Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-12-10, Amendment 39-22082 
(87 FR 45246, July 28, 2022); and
0
b. Adding the following new AD:

2025-22-05 Dassault Aviation: Amendment 39-23183; Docket No. FAA-
2025-1729; Project Identifier MCAI-2024-00568-T.

(a) Effective Date

    This airworthiness directive (AD) is effective January 2, 2026.

(b) Affected ADs

    This AD replaces AD 2022-12-10, Amendment 39-22082 (87 FR 45246, 
July 28, 2022) (AD 2022-12-10).

(c) Applicability

    This AD applies to Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes, 
certificated in any category, as identified in European Union 
Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD 2023-0003R1, dated September 26, 
2024 (EASA AD 2023-0003R1).
    Note 1 to paragraph (c): Model FALCON 7X airplanes with Dassault 
modification M1000 incorporated are commonly referred to as ``Model 
FALCON 8X'' as a marketing designation.

(d) Subject

    Air Transport Association (ATA) of America Code 34, Navigation.

(e) Unsafe Condition

    This AD was prompted by a report of a weak point identified in 
the Falcon 7X ``EASy'' avionics architecture, which, coupled with 
theoretical generic input/output (I/O) card failure, could lead to 
misleading data on display units and by development of modifications 
that fix that weak point in the avionics architecture. The FAA is 
issuing this AD to address misleading data on display units. The 
unsafe condition, if not addressed, could reduce safety margins and 
lead to increased pilot workload, possibly resulting in reduced 
controllability of the airplane.

(f) Compliance

    Comply with this AD within the compliance times specified, 
unless already done.

(g) Requirements

    Except as specified in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this AD: Comply 
with all required actions and compliance times specified in, and in 
accordance with, EASA AD 2023-0003R1.

(h) Exceptions to EASA AD 2023-0003R1

    (1) Where EASA AD 2023-0003R1 refers to September 6, 2021 (the 
effective of EASA AD 2021-0197), this AD requires using September 1, 
2022 (the effective date of AD 2022-12-10).
    (2) Where EASA AD 2023-0003R1 refers to July 26, 2022 (the 
effective date of EASA AD 2022-0145, dated July 12, 2022), and 
January 20, 2023 (the effective date of EASA AD 2023-0003, dated 
January 6, 2023), this AD requires using the effective date of this 
AD.
    (3) Where paragraph (1) of EASA AD 2023-0003R1 requires 
operators to ``inform all flight crews, and, thereafter, ensure that 
each pilot has performed the training and operates the aeroplane 
accordingly,'' and paragraph (2.2) of EASA AD 2023-0003R1 requires 
operators to ``inform all flight crews, and, thereafter, operate the 
aeroplane accordingly,'' this AD does not require those actions as 
those actions are already required by existing FAA operating 
regulations (see 14 CFR 91.9, 91.505, 121.137, and 121.628(a)(2) and 
(5)).
    (4) Where paragraph (1.3) of EASA AD 2023-0003R1 specifies to 
``Implement the instructions of the MMEL-CP'', this AD requires 
replacing that text with ``Revise the operator's existing FAA-
approved minimum equipment list (MEL) to incorporate that 
information (``the MMEL-CP'' as specified in EASA AD 2023-0003R1)''.
    (5) Paragraph (1.4) of EASA AD 2023-0003R1 does not apply to 
this AD.
    (6) This AD does not adopt the ``Remarks'' section of EASA AD 
2023-0003R1.
