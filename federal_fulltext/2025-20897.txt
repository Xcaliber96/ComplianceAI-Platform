SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    1. On December 17, 2020, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
(Commission) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR), proposing 
to amend 18 CFR 35.41(c), 284.288(a), and 284.403(a) of the 
Commission's regulations by adding language to indicate: (1) that there 
will be a rebuttable presumption of accuracy, timeliness, and good 
faith for data providers, i.e., market participants that submit 
transaction data to price index developers; and (2) that inadvertent 
reporting errors by data providers will not constitute violations of 
the Commission's regulations.\1\

    \1\ Safe Harbor Pol'y for Data Providers to Price Index 
Developers, 86 FR 12132 (March 2, 2021) 173 FERC ] 61,238 (2020) 
(NOPR).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. The Commission received nine comments in response to the 
NOPR.\2\ Eight of the comments generally supported the proposal, 
reasoning that codification of the Commission's existing policies 
regarding natural gas data providers could encourage more price 
reporting to index developers.\3\ One commenter objected to the 
proposal, arguing that there was no evidence that the regulation would 
result in any meaningful improvement in reporting to index 
developers.\4\ Commenters also included some proposals beyond the scope 
of the NOPR, including changes to the Commission's audit and 
investigation processes and creation of natural gas indices directly by 
the Commission.

    \2\ Comments were filed by the Electric Power Supply 
Association, Argus Media Inc., Pacific Gas and Electric Company, EQT 
Energy, LLC, Public Citizen, Inc., the Natural Gas Supply 
Association, Edison Electric Institute, the American Public Gas 
Association, and American Gas Association.

    3. For the reasons set forth below, we are exercising our 
discretion to withdraw the NOPR and terminate the rulemaking 
proceeding.

II. Discussion

    4. As discussed in the NOPR, the Commission initially adopted and 
clarified policies on index development in the wake of the 2000-2001 
Western Energy Crisis.\5\ In this Price Index Policy Statement, the 
Commission affirmed the need for robust, reliable indices and accurate 
reporting of transaction data to price index developers. The Commission 
issued the Price Index Policy Statement, in part, ``to explain what the 
Commission expects of natural gas and electric price indices and under 
what conditions the Commission will give industry participants safe 
harbor protection for good faith reporting of transaction data to 
entities that develop price indices.'' \6\ Regarding this safe harbor, 
``the Commission [created] a rebuttable presumption that companies and 
individuals that report trade data to price index developers in 
accordance with the standards adopted here are doing so in good faith, 
and will not be investigated or subjected to administrative penalties 
for inadvertent mistakes made in the course of reporting energy 
transaction information.'' \7\

Policy Statement).

    \7\ NOPR, 173 FERC ] 61,238 at P 6 (explaining the ``Safe Harbor 
Policy'' adopted in the Price Index Policy Statement).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    5. The NOPR proposed to codify the Safe Harbor Policy in the 
Commission's regulations to eliminate concern that the Commission might 
choose to depart

[[Page 53251]]

from the Safe Harbor Policy in future enforcement proceedings. The NOPR 
postulated that, by providing reassurance through codification, 
regulatory risk would be reduced and more participants would elect to 
report transactions to price index developers.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ Id. at P 11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. Concurrent with the issuance of the NOPR, the Commission issued 
a Proposed Revised Policy Statement \9\ on price indices to encourage 
additional market participants to report their transactions to price 
index developers, provide greater transparency into the natural gas 
price formation process, and increase confidence in the accuracy and 
reliability of wholesale natural gas prices. Subsequently, on April 21, 
2022, the Commission adopted a Revised Policy Statement addressing 
these matters.\10\ In the Revised Policy Statement, the Commission 
stated that it did not intend to act on the NOPR at that time but 
reiterated that the Safe Harbor Policy ``remains in effect.'' \11\

Formation & Transparency, & Indices Referenced in Nat. Gas & Elec. 
Tariffs, 85 FR 83940 (Dec. 23, 2020) 173 FERC ] 61,237 (2020) 
(Proposed Revised Policy Statement).
    \10\ Actions Regarding the Comm'n's Pol'y on Price Index 
Formation & Transparency, & Indices Referenced in Nat. Gas & Elec. 
Tariffs, 87 FR 25237 (April 28, 2022) 179 FERC ] 61,036 (2022) 
(Revised Policy Statement). The Revised Policy Statement allowed 
greater flexibility for market participants choosing to provide data 
to index developers. The Revised Policy Statement permitted market 
participants that report transaction data to price index developers 
to report either their non-index based next-day transactions, their 
non-index based next-month transactions, or both, to price index 
developers. In addition, the Commission encouraged data providers to 
report transactions to as many Commission-approved price index 
developers as possible, and allowed data providers to self-audit on 
a biennial basis.
    \11\ Id. at P 106.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7. Since the issuance of the NOPR, the price reporting burden for 
data providers has lessened and the number of new data providers has 
increased, thereby, bolstering price index formation. The Revised 
Policy Statement, issued in 2022, reduced the price reporting burden by 
allowing data providers to report their monthly transactions to price 
index developers without also being required to report their daily 
transactions. The next year, 2023, twenty-three new companies began 
reporting to price index developers according to Form No. 552 
submissions.\12\ Some of these newly-reporting companies report monthly 
(rather than monthly and daily) transactions to price index developers, 
taking advantage of the data reporting flexibilities announced in the 
Revised Policy Statement. In addition, some price index developers have 
increased the robustness of their price indices by including a large 
number and volume of fixed-priced transactions from the 
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).\13\ Further, consistent with the 
Revised Policy Statement, four natural gas price index developers 
submitted successful reapprovals in Docket No. PL03-3 demonstrating 
that their processes continue to meet all or substantially all of the 
Commission's standards for price index developers' indices to be 
referenced in Commission-jurisdictional tariffs.\14\ These events 
indicate that formal amendment of the Commission's regulations is not 
necessary to promote reporting of transactions to price index 
developers at this time.

    \13\ See, e.g., S&P Global Commodity Insights, FERC Policy 
Statement Price Index Developer Commission Re-approval, Docket No. 
PL03-3-000, at P 4 (February 9, 2023) (noting inclusion of ICE data 
in the relevant price indices).
    \14\ Revised Policy Statement, 173 FERC ] 61,237 at P 76.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    8. Consistent with the Safe Harbor Policy, for over two decades the 
Commission has neither investigated nor imposed penalties on any 
company for inadvertent reporting errors. As noted above, in 2022, the 
Commission reiterated the Safe Harbor Policy in the Revised Policy 
Statement.\15\ We remain committed to the Safe Harbor Policy, as it 
promotes robust, voluntary reporting to index developers. Consistent 
application of the Safe Harbor Policy and the Revised Policy Statement 
will continue to reduce any lingering concerns by data providers and 
other market participants about the regulatory risk of reporting to 
index developers.

RM20-7-000 is hereby terminated.
