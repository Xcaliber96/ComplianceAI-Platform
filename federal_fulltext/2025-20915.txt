that document on each person whose name appears on the official service 
list for the project. Further, if an intervenor files comments or 
documents with the Commission relating to the merits of an issue that

must also serve a copy of the document on that resource agency.
    l. Description of Request: The licensee requests a non-capacity 
license amendment regarding its minimum flow requirements under Article 
52. The licensee states that this amendment is necessary to 
appropriately manage the water storage of Lake Pillsbury and remain in 
compliance with the requirements of Article 52, given current interim 
risk reduction measures due to seismic concerns, storage limitations, 
and the various water demands on the system.
    First, the proposed changes to East Branch Russian River minimum 
flows, as measured by compliance gage E-16 in cubic feet per second 
(cfs), are as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Period                                          Water year classification
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              From                      Through             Normal                Dry              Critical
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
October 1.......................  April 14..........  35 cfs............  35 cfs............  5 cfs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          Scott Dam in Spill Condition
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
April 15........................  May 14............  35 cfs............  25 cfs............  5 cfs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      -or- Scott Dam not in Spill Condition
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
April 15........................  May 14............  5 cfs.............  5 cfs.............  5 cfs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          Scott Dam in Spill Condition
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
May 15..........................  June 30...........  75 cfs............  25 cfs............  5 cfs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      -or- Scott Dam not in Spill Condition

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Second, the minimum flow requirement below Scott Dam, as measured 
by compliance gage E-2, would be modified to 20 cfs at all times, 
regardless of calendar date or water year classification. In addition, 
the definition of compliance with minimum flows would be established as 
the mean daily flow, defined as the `calculated 24-hour average of the 
flow'. Further, the block water allocation of 2,500 acre-feet reserved 
for the release at the discretion of resource agencies would be changed 
from each `water' year to each `calendar' year. The licensee is 
proposing this modified mode of operation until the Commission acts on 
the pending surrender application, filed with the Commission on July 
25, 2025, or other Commission proceeding.
