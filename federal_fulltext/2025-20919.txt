[Docket No. CP25-233-000]


Magnum Gas Storage, LLC; Notice of Revised Schedule for 
Environmental Review of the 2025 Amendment Project

    This notice identifies the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
staff's revised schedule for the completion of the environmental 
assessment (EA) for Magnum Gas Storage, LLC's (Magnum) 2025 Amendment 
Project.\1\ The first notice of schedule, issued on June 26, 2025, 
identified November 13, 2025, as the EA issuance date. However, 
following a series of staff data requests, Magnum indicated that it 
will not file a response regarding the project's construction emissions 
until November 25, 2025. As this information is needed to determine the 
level of construction-related air quality effects and for the 
Commission to understand whether a General Conformity Determination is 
required for the project, staff has revised the schedule for issuance 
of the EA. The issuance date is also contingent on the quality of 
information provided by

Magnum. The EA will be issued for a 30-day comment period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For tracking purposes under the National Environmental 
Policy Act, the unique identification number for documents relating 
to this environmental review is EAXX-019-20-000-1750685312.

Schedule for Environmental Review

Issuance of the EA--December 19, 2025
90-day Federal Authorization Decision Deadline \2\--March 18, 2026
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The Commission's deadline applies to the decisions of other 
federal agencies, and state agencies acting under federally 
delegated authority, that are responsible for federal 
authorizations, permits, and other approvals necessary for proposed 
projects under the Natural Gas Act. Per 18 CFR 157.22(a), the 
Commission's deadline for other agency's decisions applies unless a 
schedule is otherwise established by federal law.

    If a schedule change becomes necessary, additional notice will be 
provided so that the relevant agencies are kept informed of the 
project's progress.
