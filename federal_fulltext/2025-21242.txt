DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

38 CFR Part 1

[Docket No. VA-2024-OTHER-0024]
RIN 2900-AS18


Extending Deadline for Debtor To Request a Waiver

AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is finalizing, with 
technical changes, a proposed rule to amend the time period that a 
debtor has to request a waiver from 180 days to one year, as mandated 
by the Cleland Dole Act. Generally, VA is authorized to not recover 
debts related to benefits payments or overpayments where recovery would 
be against good conscience and an application for relief is made within 
the required time period. Allowing an additional six months to request 
a waiver reduces pressure on veterans by easing the compliance burden.

DATES: This rule is effective on January 26, 2026.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeremiah Mcintosh, Systems and 
Procedures Analyst, Office of Finance, Office of Management, (207) 402-
9017.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 8, 2024, VA published a proposed 
rule in the Federal Register, 89 FR 88686, to amend the time period 
that a debtor has to request a waiver from 180 days to one year 
consistent with section 254 of the Cleland Dole Act, Public Law 117-
328, Division U, which went into effect on December 29, 2024. VA 
provided a 60-day comment period, which ended on January 7, 2025. VA 
received one supportive comment, which also contained a request that 
was outside the scope of the rulemaking. VA is not making any changes 
to the final regulation based on this comment. For the reasons stated 
above, VA will adopt the proposed rule as final, with technical 
changes.

Technical Changes Not Related to Comments

    Currently, 38 CFR 1.963(b)(1) establishes a two-year timeframe for 
individuals to submit a request for waiver from indebtedness for VA 
notices of indebtedness issued by VA on or before March 31, 1983, 
without any exception to extend this timeframe. This two-year timeframe 
was consistent with 38 U.S.C. 5302(a), prior to such statute being 
amended to substitute ``180 days'' for the former ``two years,'' and to 
newly include an exception to extend the 180-day timeframe if an 
individual could show their receipt of VA's notice was delayed. See 
Public Law 97-306, sec. 407(b), enacted Oct. 14, 1982, effective March 
31, 1983.
    Subject to this statutory amendment, VA promulgated Sec.  
1.963(b)(2) on June 15, 1983, establishing a new timeframe of 180 days 
from the date of VA notice for those notices issued by VA after March 
31, 1983, and including a new exception to extend that timeframe. 48 FR 
27400. At the time that VA first promulgated Sec.  1.963(b)(2), this 
new 180-day timeframe overlapped the former two-year timeframe in Sec.  
1.963(b)(1), and so VA retained paragraph (b)(1) to ensure that the 
former, longer timeframe had adequate time to run. However, paragraph 
(b)(1) is now obsolete as the former two-year timeframe for notices of 
indebtedness issued by VA on or prior to March 31, 1983, has long since 
passed, and there is no statutory exception to extend that two-year 
timeframe for such notices. VA therefore removes paragraph (b)(1) of 
Sec.  1.963 in this final rule. In so doing, VA will now only regulate 
applicable timeframes for individuals to submit requests for waivers of 
indebtedness in a single paragraph (b) under Sec.  1.963.
    VA proposed to revise Sec.  1.963(b)(1) to replace the former 180-
day timeframe with one year for all notices issued by VA after April 1, 
1983, so that application of waiver can be ``made within one year 
following the date of a notice of indebtedness issued on or after April 
1, 1983, by the Department of Veterans Affairs to the debtor.'' 89 FR 
88687. This proposed revision was based on amendments to 38 U.S.C.

[[Page 54235]]

5302(a)(1) as made by section 254 of the Joseph Maxwell Cleland and 
Robert Joseph Dole Memorial Veterans Benefits and Health Care 
Improvement Act of 2022 (Div. U of Pub. L. 117-328, enacted December 
29, 2022, hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''). However, section 254 
of the Act amended 38 U.S.C. 5302(a)(1) to establish a one-year 
timeframe to apply for waiver only for notices of indebtedness issued 
by VA on and after December 29, 2024, not to any notice issued by VA on 
or after April 1, 1983, as stated in the proposed rule. Any notice 
issued by VA from April 1, 1983, through December 28, 2024, would 
technically still be subject to the former 180-day timeframe in section 
5302(a)(1), prior to the most recent amendment to that statute as made 
by section 254 of the Act (albeit, that former 180-day timeframe lapsed 
on June 26, 2025, for any notice of indebtedness issued by VA as late 
as December 28, 2024).
    Although the proposed rule did not distinguish the two timeframes 
for waiver requests based on the effective date of the change made to 
38 U.S.C. 5302(a)(1) by section 254 of the Act, the former timeframe of 
180 days for notices of indebtedness issued by VA from April 1, 1983, 
through December 28, 2024, is not relevant. That 180-day timeframe 
would have lapsed on June 26, 2025, for any notice of indebtedness that 
VA could have issued as late as December 28, 2024. We acknowledge that 
38 U.S.C. 5302(a)(1) provides an exception to extend the 180-day 
timeframe if an individual could show their receipt of VA's notice was 
delayed. However, as of the date of publication of this final rule, VA 
does not have knowledge that any individual issued a notice by VA as 
late as December 28, 2024, has otherwise submitted proof to VA that 
their receipt of VA's notice was delayed in accordance with the current 
regulatory language in Sec.  1.963(b)(2), that ``as a result of an 
error by either the Department of Veterans Affairs or the postal 
authorities, or due to other circumstances beyond the debtor's control, 
there was a delay in such individual's receipt of the notification of 
indebtedness beyond the time customarily required for mailing 
(including forwarding).'' There would therefore be no risk to VA in 
publishing a final rule without any date(s) of VA notice otherwise 
referenced in 38 CFR 1.963(b).
    This final rule therefore makes changes from the proposed rule to 
remove paragraph (b)(1) from Sec.  1.963, and renumber and revise Sec.  
1.963(b)(2) as proposed to be a new paragraph (b) that retains the 
current one-year statutory timeframe in 38 U.S.C. 5302(a)(1) to submit 
a request for waiver, but removes the reference to notices of 
indebtedness by VA issued on or after April 1, 1983.

Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 14192

    VA examined the impact of this rulemaking as required by Executive 
Orders 12866 (Sept. 30, 1993) and 13563 (Jan. 18, 2011), which direct 
agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits. A regulatory impact analysis 
must be prepared for major rules with effects of $100 million or more 
in any one year. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has 
determined that this rulemaking is a significant regulatory action 
under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866, as supplemented by 
Executive Order 13563. This final rule is a deregulatory action under 
Executive Order 14192 because it reduces pressure on veterans by easing 
the compliance burden associated with debt waivers by allowing an 
additional six months to request a waiver. The Regulatory Impact 
Analysis associated with this rulemaking can be found as a supporting 
document at <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a>.

Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)

    The Secretary hereby certifies that this final rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-
612). The factual basis for this certification is based on the fact 
that the final rule only affects individual veteran debtors, not small 
entities. In addition, the final rule gives debtors more time to 
request a waiver which will not have a negative economic impact on the 
debtors. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the initial and final 
regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604 do 
not apply.

Unfunded Mandates

    This final rule will not result in the expenditure by State, local, 
and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of 
$100 million or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year.

Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)

    This rulemaking contains no provisions constituting a collection of 
information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-
3521).

Congressional Review Act

    This rule may result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 
million or more and is considered a major rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 
804(2). Thus, this rule is subject to a 60-day delayed effective date 
under 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(3).

PART 1--GENERAL PROVISIONS

0
1. The authority citation for part 1 continues to read as follows:

    Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, and as noted in specific sections.


0
2. Amend Sec.  1.963 by revising paragraph (b) and the sectional 
authority to read as follows:


Sec.  1.963  Waiver; other than loan guaranty.

* * * * *
    (b) Application. A request for waiver of an indebtedness under this 
section shall only be considered if made within one year following the 
date of a notice of indebtedness issued by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs to the debtor. The one-year period may be extended if the 
individual requesting waiver demonstrated to the Chairperson of the 
Committee on Waivers and Compromises that, as a result of an error by 
either the Department of Veterans Affairs or the postal authorities, or 
due to other circumstances beyond the debtor's control, there was a 
delay in such individual's receipt of the notification of indebtedness 
beyond the time customarily required for mailing (including 
forwarding). If the requester does substantiate that there was such a 
delay in the receipt of the notice of indebtedness, the Chairperson 
shall direct that the one-year period be computed from the date of the 
requester's actual receipt of the notice of indebtedness.
