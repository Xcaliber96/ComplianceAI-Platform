    Current Actions: Extension.

    Affected Public: Businesses.
    Abstract: Imported merchandise which is to remain in the customs 
territory for a period of one year or less without the payment of 
duties with the intent to destroy or export is entered as a temporary 
importation of goods under bond (TIB), as authorized under the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202). 
Consistent with 19 CFR 10.37, when this time period is not sufficient, 
importers and brokers may request an extension by submitting a CBP Form 
3173, ``Application for Extension of Bond for Temporary Importation'', 
either electronically or manually, to the Center Director. The period 
of time may be extended for not more than two further periods of 1 year 
each, or such shorter periods as may be appropriate. An Extension may 
be granted by CBP, upon written or electronic submission

of a CBP Form 3173, provided that the articles have not been exported 
or destroyed before receipt of the application, and liquidated damages

accessible at: <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/forms?title=3173">https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/forms?title=3173</a>.

document imaging, certain Automated Commercial Environment (ACE)

Specifically, importers and brokers, are allowed to submit official CBP 
documents and specified PGA forms via the Electronic Data Interchange

additional forms and these other forms may be referenced in the DIS 
implementation guidelines.
    This information collection is necessary to ensure compliance with
