SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[OMB Control No. 3235-0764]


Agency Information Collection Activities; Submission for OMB 
Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 6c-11

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget a request for extension of the previously 
approved collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'') 
permits exchange-traded funds (``ETFs'') that satisfy certain 
conditions to operate without first obtaining an exemptive order from 
the Commission. The rule was designed to create a consistent, 
transparent, and efficient regulatory framework for ETFs and facilitate 
greater competition and innovation among ETFs. Rule 6c-11 requires an 
ETF to disclose certain information on its website, to maintain certain 
records, and to adopt and implement written policies and procedures 
governing its constructions of baskets, as well as written policies and 
procedures that set forth detailed parameters for the construction and 
acceptance of custom baskets that are in the best interests of the ETF 
and its shareholders.
    We estimate that the total hour burdens and time costs associated 
with rule 6c-11, including the burden associated with reviewing and 
updating website disclosures, recordkeeping, and reviewing and updating 
policies and procedures, will result in an average aggregate annual 
burden of 74,580.75 hours and an average aggregate time cost of 
$1,964,817.
    The requirements of this collection of information are mandatory. 
If information collected pursuant to rule 6c-11 is reviewed by the 
Commission's examination staff, it will be accorded the same level of 
confidentiality accorded to other responses provided to the Commission 
in the context of its examination and oversight program.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB Control Number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the SEC, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the SEC's estimate of the burden 
imposed by the proposed collection of information, including the 
validity of the methodology and the assumptions used; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated, 
electronic collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology.
    The public may view and comment on this information collection

Assistant Secretary.
