    m. Description of Request: On July 25, 2025, Pacific Gas and 
Electric Company (PG&E) filed a surrender application, in which it 
proposes to surrender and decommission the Potter Valley Project. As a 
condition of surrender, PG&E also requests the Commission approve its 
application for non-project use of project lands, which would allow the 
Eel-Russian Project Authority (ERPA) to construct a New Eel-Russian 
Facility (NERF) on project lands. This NERF would allow for the 
continued diversion of flows from the Eel River watershed to the 
Russian River watershed via certain project works post-surrender.
    Specifically, PG&E proposes to: (1) decommission and remove Scott 
Dam and its associated facilities; (2) remove licensed recreational 
facilities (e.g., campgrounds, day-use facilities, kiosk, and boat 
ramps) and restore associated U.S. Forest Service (Forest Service) and 
PG&E lands; (3) decommission and remove Cape Horn Dam and its 
associated facilities and features, except for those necessary for the 
NERF; (4) remove NERF facilities and lands from the existing license; 
and (5) restore the remnant inundation zone of Lake Pillsbury reservoir 
and Van Arsdale Reservoir, including adjacent riparian, wetlands, and 
upland areas affected by decommissioning the project as proposed.
