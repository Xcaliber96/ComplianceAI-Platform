[[Page 53277]]

    Type of Request: Regular submission, revision of a currently 
approved collection.
    Number of Respondents: 3,000.
    Average Hours per Response: 16 hours.
    Burden Hours: 48,000 hours.
    Needs and Uses: Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 
U.S.C. 1862) authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to 
conduct comprehensive investigations to determine the effects of 
imports of an article on the national security of the United States. 
Such investigations can be initiated by an application by an interested 
party, a request from the head of any department or agency, or self-
initiated by the Secretary. Once an investigation is initiated, the 
Secretary submits a report to the President on whether the importation 
of the article in question is occurring in such quantities or under 
such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of 
the United States. The President then determines whether it is 
necessary to take action to adjust the imports of an article and its 
derivatives under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act.
    The President has initiated twelve investigations into the effects 
of imports of various article on the national security of the United 
States under Section 232 since March 2025. The President has also 
issued multiple Presidential Proclamations implementing tariffs or 
similar actions to adjust imports of these articles based on the 
findings of these investigations under Section 232, or revising tariffs 
or other actions previously implemented with respect to certain 
articles following prior investigations under Section 232.
    Several Proclamations have directed the Secretary to create a 
process for including additional derivative articles within the scope 
of the new and existing ad valorem tariffs established under Section 
232, including Proclamations 10895 and 10896 of February 2025 (for the 
Section 232 Steel and Aluminum Tariff), Proclamation 10962 of July 2025 
(for the Section 232 Copper Tariff), and Proclamation 10976 of 
September 2025 (for the Section 232 Timber and Lumber Tariff). These 
Proclamations broadly authorize the Secretary to include additional 
derivative articles within the scope of the tariffs unilaterally, or at 
the request of a producer (or an industry association representing one 
or more such producers) of such articles or derivative articles within 
the United States after establishing that imports of said derivative 
article have increased in a manner that threatens to impair the 
national security of the United States or otherwise undermine the 
objectives set forth in the investigations under Section 232 or their 
associated Presidential Proclamations.
    BIS established the Section 232 Inclusions Process in an Interim 
Final Rule entitled `Adoption and Procedures of the Section 232 Steel 
and Aluminum Tariff Inclusions Process' (90 FR 18780) in May 2025. The 
Interim Final Rule established the guidelines and procedures for 
submitting additional derivative aluminum and steel articles as Section 
232 Inclusion Requests. BIS will expand the scope of additional 
derivative articles encompassed by this Interim Final Rule as needed to 
incorporate future investigations under Section 232.
    Affected Public: Business or other for-profit organizations.
    Frequency: On Occasion.
    Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary.
    Legal Authority: Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, 
and implementing Presidential Proclamations including but not limited 
to Presidential Proclamations 10895 and 10896 of February 10, 2025, 
Presidential Proclamation 10962 of July 30, 2025, and Presidential 
Proclamation 10976 of September 29, 2025.
