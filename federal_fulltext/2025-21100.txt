Background

    The FAA has received reports indicating that cracking was found in 
the bear strap and stub frame at the forward galley door cutout, from 
station (STA) 290 to STA 296 and between stringer S-8R and stringer S-
9R, on certain Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER 
series airplanes (737NG airplanes). Boeing investigated and found 
surface scratches on the bear strap, which were inadvertently created 
while removing sealant and adhesive during hot bonding process of 
fuselage skin and bear strap. The presence of these scratches, along 
with local elevated stresses in the bear strap, cause a reduction in 
fatigue life and early cracking. Although no cracks have been reported 
in the same areas on The Boeing Company Model 737 MAX airplanes, The 
Boeing Company Model 737 MAX airplanes have similar design and build 
process, making The Boeing Company Model 737 MAX airplanes susceptible 
to the same crack condition. This condition, if not addressed, may 
result in the inability of a principal structural element to sustain 
limit load, which could adversely affect the structural integrity of 
the airplane.
    Boeing issued Requirements Bulletin 737-53A1383 to address the 
identified unsafe condition for The Boeing Company Model 737NG 
airplanes. Subsequently, the FAA issued AD 2021-02-13, Amendment 39-
21396 (86 FR10776, February 23, 2021) to require inspections of the 
fuselage skin and bear strap at the forward galley door between certain 
stations for cracks, and applicable on-condition actions, in accordance 
with Boeing Alert Requirements Bulletin 737-53A1383 RB, Revision 1, 
dated February 19, 2020.

FAA's Determination

    The FAA is issuing this NPRM after determining that the unsafe 
condition described previously is likely to exist or develop on other 
products of the same type design.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed Boeing Alert Requirements Bulletin 737-53A1420 RB, 
dated February 13, 2025. This material specifies procedures for doing

[[Page 53244]]

Option 1 or Option 2 actions as specified below, and applicable on-
condition actions. On-condition actions include replacing the stub 
frame, doing alternative inspections, and doing a repair.
    <bullet> Option 1--Perform initial external general visual 
inspection (GVI) of the fuselage skin and gap cover for any repair, 
initial internal GVI of the bear strap and stub frame for any repair, 
and repetitive internal high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections 
of the bear strap and stub frame for any crack.
    <bullet> Option 2--Perform initial external GVI of the fuselage 
skin and gap cover for any repair, initial internal GVI of the stub 
frame for any repair, initial external HFEC inspection of the fuselage 
skin for any crack, initial external low frequency eddy current (LFEC) 
inspection of the bear strap for any crack, initial internal HFEC 
inspection of the stub frame for any crack, and repetitive internal 
HFEC inspections of the bear strap and stub frame for any crack.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Proposed AD Requirements in This NPRM

    This proposed AD would require accomplishing the actions specified 
in the material already described, except for any differences 
identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of this proposed AD. 
For information on the procedures and compliance times, see this 
material at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under Docket No. FAA-2025-3439.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD, if adopted as proposed, would 
affect 476 airplanes of U.S. registry. The FAA estimates the following 
costs to comply with this proposed AD:

                                                 Estimated Costs

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FAA estimates the following costs to do any necessary 
replacements that would be required based on the results of the 
proposed inspection. The agency has no way of determining the number of 
aircraft that might need this replacement:

                                               On-Condition Costs

                                                $2,975.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FAA has received no definitive data that would enable the 
agency to provide cost estimates for the on-condition repairs specified 
in this proposed AD.

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship 
between the national government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed 
regulation:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
