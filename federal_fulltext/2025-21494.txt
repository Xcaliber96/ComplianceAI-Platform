SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[OMB Control No. 3235-0066]


Agency Information Collection Activities; Submission for OMB 
Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form S-8-Securities Act 
Registration Statement

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Form S-8 (17 CFR 239.16b) under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 
U.S.C. 77a et seq.) is the primary registration statement used by 
eligible registrants to register securities to be issued in connection 
with an employee benefit plan. The information collected is intended to 
ensure the adequacy of information available to investors in connection 
with securities offerings. The information required by Form S-8 is 
mandatory, and Form S-8 is publicly available on the Commission's 
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (``EDGAR'') system. 
We estimate that Form S-8 takes approximately 28.25 hours per response 
to prepare and is filed once per year by approximately 2,541 
respondents. We estimate that 50% of the burden (14.125 hours) is 
carried internally by the issuer for a total annual reporting burden of 
35,892 (14.125 hours per response x 2,541 responses). We estimate that 
50% of the burden is carried externally by outside professionals at a 
rate of $600 per hour for a total cost burden of $21,534,975 (14.125 
hours per response x $600 per hour x 2,541 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB Control Number.
