Rescission of Fee Rates

AGENCY: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Interior.

ACTION: Direct final rule; request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 54580]]

SUMMARY: This direct final rule revises the Federal regulations to 
rescind expired fee rates for coal produced for sale, transfer, or use 
from October 1, 2012, through September 30, 2021. New rates have been 
established and are in effect beginning October 1, 2021, through 
September 30, 2034.

DATES: The final rule is effective January 27, 2026, unless significant 
adverse comments are received by December 29, 2025. If significant 
adverse comments are received, notice will be published in the Federal 
Register before the effective date either withdrawing the rule or 
issuing a new final rule that responds to significant adverse comments.

ADDRESSES: You may submit comments by one of the following methods:
    <bullet> Electronically: Go to the Federal eRulemaking Portal: 
<a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> and search for Docket Number [OSM-2025-
0004]. Follow the instructions for submitting comments.
    <bullet> By hard copy: Submit by U.S. mail to Division of 
Regulatory Support, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and 
Enforcement, Department of the Interior, Attn: James Tyree, 1849 C 
Street NW, Mail Stop 4557, Washington, DC 20240.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Tyree, Chief, Division of 
Regulatory Support, (202) 208-4479, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#80eaf4f9f2e5e5c0eff3edf2e5aee7eff6"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="caa0beb3b8afaf8aa5b9a7b8afe4ada5bc">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Individuals in 
the United States who are deaf, deafblind, hard of hearing, or have a 
speech disability may dial 711 (TTY, TDD, or TeleBraille) to access 
telecommunications relay services. Individuals outside the United 
States should use the relay services offered within their country to 
make international calls to the point-of-contact in the United States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal regulations implementing the 
version of 30 U.S.C. 1232(a) that was in effect before the amendments 
made to that section by Public Law 117-58 (2021) are contained in 30 
CFR 870.13(a). These regulations set fees for coal produced for sale, 
transfer, or use from October 1, 2012, through September 30, 2021. Upon 
reviewing these regulations, the Department of the Interior 
(Department) and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and 
Enforcement (OSMRE) have determined that this provision should be 
rescinded due to obsolescence resulting from the passage of time. The 
content of existing paragraph (b) of 30 CFR 870.13 will become the 
entire remaining section. No changes were made to the content of 
existing paragraph (b).
    The Department has determined that this reason, independently and 
alone, justifies rescission of 30 CFR 870.13(a). The Department has no 
interest in maintaining a rule that is obsolete.
    The Department is issuing this rule as a direct final rule. 
Although the Administrative Procedure Act (APA, 5 U.S.C. 551-559) 
generally requires agencies to engage in notice and comment rulemaking, 
section 553 of the APA provides an exception when the agency ``for good 
cause finds'' that notice and comment are ``impracticable, unnecessary, 
or contrary to the public interest.'' Id. Sec.  553(b)(B). The 
Department has determined that notice and comment are unnecessary 
because this rule is noncontroversial; of a minor, technical nature; 
involves little agency discretion; and is unlikely to receive any 
significant adverse comments. Significant adverse comments are those 
that oppose the recission of the rule and raise, alone or in 
combination, (1) reasons why the recission of the rule is 
inappropriate, including challenges to the recission's underlying 
premise, or (2) serious unintended consequences of the recission. A 
comment recommending an addition to the rule will not be considered 
significant and adverse unless the comment explains how this direct 
final rule would be ineffective without the addition.

Procedural Determinations

Executive Order 12630--Governmental Actions and Interference With 
Constitutionally Protected Property Rights

    This rule does not result in a taking of private property or 
otherwise have regulatory takings implications under Executive Order 
12630. The rule rescinds an obsolete regulatory provision; therefore, 
the rule will not result in private property being taken for public use 
without just compensation. A takings implication assessment is not 
required.

Executive Order 12866--Regulatory Planning and Review and Executive 
Order 13563--Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review

    Executive Order 12866 provides that the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
will review all significant rules. OIRA has determined that this rule 
is not significant.
    Executive Order 13563 reaffirms the principles of Executive Order 
12866, while calling for improvements in the Nation's regulatory system 
to promote predictability, reduce uncertainty, and use the best, most 
innovative, and least burdensome tools for achieving regulatory ends. 
Executive Order 13563 directs agencies to consider regulatory 
approaches that reduce burdens and maintain flexibility and freedom of 
choice for the public where these approaches are relevant, feasible, 
and consistent with regulatory objectives. Executive Order 13563 
emphasizes further that agencies must base regulations on the best 
available science and that the rulemaking process must allow for public 
participation and an open exchange of ideas. The Department developed 
this rule in a manner consistent with these requirements.

Executive Order 12988--Civil Justice Reform

    This direct final rule complies with the requirements of Executive 
Order 12988. Among other things, this rule:
    (a) Meets the criteria of section 3(a) requiring that all 
regulations be reviewed to eliminate errors and ambiguity and be 
written to minimize litigation;
    (b) Meets the criteria of section 3(b)(2) requiring that all 
regulations be written in clear language and contain clear legal 
standards.

Executive Order 13132--Federalism

    Under the criteria of section 1 of Executive Order 13132, this rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the 
preparation of a federalism summary impact statement. This rule will 
not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship 
between the national government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. A 
federalism summary impact statement is not required.

Executive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments

    The Department of the Interior strives to strengthen its 
government-to-government relationship with Indian tribes through a 
commitment to consultation with Tribes and recognition of their right 
to self-governance and Tribal sovereignty. The Department evaluated 
this direct final rule under Executive Order 13175 and the Department's 
consultation policies and determined that it has no substantial direct 
effects on federally recognized Indian tribes and that consultation 
under the Department's Tribal consultation policies is not required. 
The rule merely revises the

[[Page 54581]]

Federal regulations to remove obsolete regulatory language.

Executive Order 13211--Actions Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use

    This direct final rule is not a significant energy action as 
defined in Executive Order 13211. Therefore, a Statement of Energy 
Effects is not required.

National Environmental Policy Act

    This direct final rule does not constitute a major Federal action 
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. A 
detailed statement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA, 
42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) is not required because this rule is covered by 
a categorical exclusion applicable to regulatory functions ``that are 
of an administrative, financial, legal, technical, or procedural 
nature.'' 43 CFR 46.210(i). In addition, the Department has determined 
that this rule does not involve any of the extraordinary circumstances 
listed in 43 CFR 46.215 that would require further analysis under NEPA.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    This rule does not impose any new information collection burden 
under the Paperwork Reduction Act. OMB previously approved the 
information collection activities contained in the existing regulations 
and assigned OMB control number 1029-0063. This rule does not impose an 
information collection burden because the Department is not making any 
changes to the information collection requirements.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA, 5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires an 
agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for all rules 
unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The RFA 
applies only to rules for which an agency is required to first publish 
a proposed rule. See 5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a). As the Department is 
not required to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking for this direct 
final rule, the RFA does not apply.

Congressional Review Act

    This rule is not a major rule under the Congressional Review Act, 5 
U.S.C. 804(2). Specifically, the direct final rule: (a) will not have 
an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (b) will not 
cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual 
industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic 
regions; and (c) will not have significant adverse effects on 
competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on 
the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-
based enterprises in domestic and export markets.

Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

    This rule does not impose an unfunded mandate on State, local, or 
Tribal governments, or the private sector, of more than $100 million 
per year. The rule does not have a significant or unique effect on 
State, local, or Tribal governments, or the private sector. The rule 
merely revises the Federal regulations to remove an obsolete provision 
that is no longer used. Therefore, a statement containing the 
information required by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1531 
et seq.) is not required.
