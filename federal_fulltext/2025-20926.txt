    j. The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or 
Commission) will prepare an environmental document that will discuss 
the environmental effects of relicensing the Lewis Ridge Pumped Storage 
Project. The Commission will use this environmental document in its 
decision-making process to determine whether to issue a license for the 
project.
    k. This notice announces the opening of the scoping process the 
Commission will use to gather input from the public and interested 
agencies regarding the project. This notice is intended to advise all 
participants as to the potential scope of the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA) document and to seek additional information pertinent 
to this analysis. Commission staff does not intend to issue a separate 
scoping document.
    As part of the NEPA review process, the Commission takes into 
account concerns the public may have about proposals and the 
environmental effects that could result from its action whenever it 
considers the issuance of a hydropower license. This gathering of 
public input is referred to as ``scoping.'' The main goal of the 
scoping process is to focus the analysis in the environmental document 
on the important environmental issues.
    l. Scoping Comments: By this notice, the Commission requests 
written public comments on the scope of issues to address in the 
environmental document. To ensure that your comments are timely and 
properly recorded, please submit your comments so that the Commission 
receives them in Washington, DC on or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 
December 23, 2025.
    Comments should focus on the potential environmental effects and 
reasonable alternatives. Your input will help the Commission staff 
determine what issues they need to evaluate in the environmental 
document. Commission staff will consider all written comments during 
the preparation of the environmental document.
    The Commission strongly encourages electronic filing. Please file 
scoping comments using the Commission's eFiling system at <a href="https://ferconline.ferc.gov/FERCOnline.aspx">https://ferconline.ferc.gov/FERCOnline.aspx</a>. Commenters can submit brief 
comments up to 10,000 characters, without prior registration, using the 
eComment system at <a href="https://ferconline.ferc.gov/QuickComment.aspx">https://ferconline.ferc.gov/QuickComment.aspx</a>. For

Rockville, MD 20852. All filings must clearly identify the project name 
and docket number on the first page: Lewis Ridge Pumped Storage Project 
(P-15249-002).
    The Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure require all 
intervenors filing documents with the Commission to serve a copy of 
that document on each person on the official service list for the 
project. Further, if an intervenor files comments or documents with the 
Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the 
responsibilities of a particular resource agency, they must also serve 
a copy of the document on that resource agency.
    m. The application is not ready for environmental analysis at this 
time. On October 24, 2025 the Commission issued a request for 
additional information with a response due from the applicant by 
December 8, 2025.
    n. Project Description: The proposed project boundary would enclose 
about 148 acres of privately owned land, primarily owned by Asher Land 
and Mineral, LLLP, on which it previously conducted surface and 
underground coal mining. About 16 additional parcels of privately owned 
property would be included in the project boundary, primarily along the 
transmission line and water intake conduit extending from the 
Cumberland River to the lower reservoir. These lands are identified in 
Exhibit G of the application (Project Boundary Drawing).
    The proposed Lewis Ridge Project would consist of a 48.2-acre upper 
reservoir created by an 8,241-foot-long, 50-foot-high rocky earth-fill 
dam with an integrated emergency overflow spillway passing flows to the 
Pound Mill Branch and into Puckett Creek. The upper reservoir would 
have an active storage of about 2,602 acre-feet between normal maximum 
elevation 2,150 feet and normal minimum elevation 2,076 feet. An intake 
in the upper reservoir would pass flows to a 3,134-foot-long, 16-foot-
diameter aboveground penstock. The penstock would connect to a 
powerhouse located 267 feet below ground, containing two 154-megawatt 
(MW) reversible pump-turbines with a total rated capacity of 308 MW. 
Flows from the powerhouse would pass through two 249-foot-long, 12-
foot-diameter draft tubes to a 110-foot-long water intake located at 
the lower reservoir. The 51.6-acre lower reservoir would be created by 
a 1,120-foot-long, 138-foot-high earth-fill dam and have an integrated 
emergency overflow spillway passing flows to the Cumberland River. The 
lower reservoir would have a gross storage of 3,486 acre-feet and 
active storage of about 2,602 acre-feet between normal maximum 
elevation 1,134 feet and normal minimum elevation 1,034 feet.
    A permanent intake would be located on the Cumberland River to 
provide initial fill flows and maintenance flows. The intake would 
consist of 6 screened inlets which connect to a removable/mobile 
pumping station. Flows from the pumping station would pass through 
three parallel 4,724-foot-long, 24-inch-diameter buried pipelines which 
would direct flows to a stilling basin at the lower reservoir.

[[Page 53318]]

    LRPS would develop about 7.1 miles of permanent roads for project 
access and maintenance, and 4 miles of temporary roads for 
construction. LRPS would use two disposal sites to deposit excess spoil 
material (excavated soil and rocks). After construction is completed, 
these sites would be seeded and revegetated.
    The project would include a 2.5-mile-long, 161-kilovolt overhead 
transmission line and two switching stations, connecting the project 
powerhouse to the existing Pineville-Harlan #1 transmission line. Under 
normal operation, the project would have the capacity to produce about 
717,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of peak energy annually.

Project Operation

    The Lewis Ridge Pumped Storage Project would use flows from the 
Cumberland River and Tom Fork River for the initial fill and periodic 
recharge of the reservoirs. The project would require about 2,808 acre-
feet of water for the initial fill and 149 acre-feet annually to 
replace water that would be lost to evaporation and seepage. All flows 
in the Tom Fork River above 2.8 cubic feet per second (cfs) would be 
available for maintenance flows and initial fill. About 10% of the mean 
monthly flow in the Cumberland River would be used for initial fill and 
to supplement Tom Fork River flows for maintenance when needed.
    The lower reservoir would inundate part of the 1.8-mile-long Tom 
Fork River. The lower reservoir dam would include a low-level outlet, 
which would be used for emergency releases, as well as providing 
approximately 2.8 cfs (the estimated mean annual flow) to the lower 
section of the Tom Fork River.
    The proposed project would pump water from the lower reservoir to 
the upper reservoir during periods of low electrical demand (i.e., off-
peak energy, likely during nights and weekends) and generate energy by 
passing the water from the upper to the lower reservoir through the 
generating units during periods of high electrical demand (i.e., peak 
energy, likely during weekdays). Water surface elevations in the upper 
reservoir would fluctuate about 74 feet under normal operation. The 
water surface elevation in the lower reservoir would fluctuate 100 
feet. The project would produce 266 MW of energy for an 8-hour 
generation cycle and take 8.8 hours to return water from the lower 
reservoir to the upper reservoir. The return cycle would require 340 MW 
of power. The proposed project would be operated to maximize benefits 
to the electrical grid while minimizing evaporation from both 
reservoirs.
    Under an original license, in addition to constructing, operating, 
and maintaining the project as described above, LRPS would implement 
the following measures: (1) additional geo-technical analyses; (2) an 
Erosion and Sediment Control Plan; (3) a Water Quality Monitoring Plan; 
(4) a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan; (5) a Hazardous Substances 
Spill Prevention and Cleanup Plan; (6) a Groundwater Protection Plan; 
(7) fish exclusion measures; (8) mussel relocation; (9) a Wildlife 
Management Plan; (10) a Vegetation Management Plan; and (11) a Historic 
Properties Management Plan.

(866) 208-3676 (toll free), or (202) 502-8659 (TTY).
    o. NEPA Process and the Environmental Document: Any environmental 
document issued by the Commission will discuss effects that could occur 
as a result of the project's licensing under the relevant general 
resource areas, such as:
    <bullet> geology and soils;
    <bullet> aquatic resources;
    <bullet> terrestrial resources;
    <bullet> threatened and endangered species;
    <bullet> recreation, land use, and aesthetic resources;
    <bullet> cultural resources; and
    <bullet> developmental resources.
    Commission staff will also evaluate reasonable alternatives to the 
proposed project or portions of the project and make recommendations on 
how to lessen or avoid effects on the various resource areas. Your 
comments will help Commission staff identify and focus on the issues 
that might have an effect on the human environment and potentially 
eliminate others from further discussion in the environmental document.
    Following this scoping period, Commission staff will determine 
whether to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) or an Environmental 
Impact Statement (EIS). The EA or EIS will present Commission staff's 
independent analysis of the issues. If Commission staff prepares an EA, 
a Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Assessment will be 
issued. The EA may be issued for an allotted public comment period. The 
Commission would consider timely comments on the EA before making its 
decision regarding the proposed project. If Commission staff prepares 
an EIS, a Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement 
will be issued. Staff will then prepare a draft EIS which will be 
issued for public comment. Commission staff will consider all timely 
comments received during the comment period on the draft EIS and revise 
the document, as necessary, before issuing a final EIS. Any EA or draft 
and final EIS will be available in electronic format in the public 
record through eLibrary. If eSubscribed, you will receive instant email 
notification when the environmental document is issued (see paragraph 
(q) of this notice for instructions on using eSubscription).

meaningful public engagement and participation in Commission 
proceedings. OPP can help members of the public, including landowners, 
community organizations, Tribal members and others, access publicly 
available information and navigate Commission processes. For public
