Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration

[Docket No. FMCSA-2025-0103]


Hours of Service of Drivers: Protein Transport of Indiana, 
L.L.C.; Application for Exemption

AGENCY: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), Department 
of Transportation (DOT).

ACTION: Notice of final disposition; denial of application for 
exemption.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: FMCSA announces its decision to deny Protein Transport of 
Indiana, LLC's (Protein Transport) request for an exemption from the 
hours-of-service (HOS) regulations. FMCSA analyzed the application and 
public comments and determined that the exemption would not likely 
achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the 
level that would be achieved absent such exemption.

Carrier Operations Division; Office of Carrier, Driver and Vehicle 
Safety Standards, FMCSA; (202) 507-0363; or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#480a2d3a26292c2d3c3c2d663f2924232d3a082c273c662f273e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="296b4c5b47484d4c5d5d4c075e4845424c5b694d465d074e465f">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

II. Legal Basis

    FMCSA has authority under 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b) to grant 
exemptions from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. FMCSA 
must publish a notice of each exemption request in the Federal Register 
(49 CFR 381.315(a)). The Agency must provide the public an opportunity 
to inspect the information relevant to the application, including the 
applicant's safety analysis. The Agency must provide an opportunity for 
public comment on the request.
    The Agency reviews the application, safety analyses and, public 
comments submitted and determines whether granting the exemption would 
likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the 
level that would be achieved absent such exemption, pursuant to the 
standard set forth in 49 U.S.C. 31315(b)(1). The Agency must publish 
its decision in the Federal Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, 
the notice will identify the regulatory provision from which the 
applicant will be exempt, the effective period, and all terms and 
conditions of the exemption (49 CFR 381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption is 
denied, the notice will explain the reason for the denial (49 CFR 
381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may be renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)).

III. Background

Current Regulatory Requirements

    FMCSA prescribes HOS limits on commercial motor vehicle (CMV) 
driver on-duty and driving time, among other requirements, to reduce 
the possibility of driver fatigue. Congress created an exemption from 
the the HOS regulations for CMV drivers transporting agricultural 
commodities during planting and harvesting periods in each State. The 
statutory exemption was initially enacted in 1995 and subsequently 
revised (109 Stat. 568, 613, Nov. 28, 1995).
    FMCSA codified the statutory exemption in 49 CFR 395.1(k), which 
provides that drivers are exempt from HOS requirements when 
transporting agricultural commodities, including livestock, and farm 
supplies for agricultural purposes, to a location within 150 air miles 
of the source of the

[[Page 55330]]

exempt product during the harvest and planting seasons, as defined by 
each State. Once a driver operates beyond the 150 air-mile radius, the 
HOS regulations apply, except that livestock are also exempt from the 
HOS rules when transported within a 150 air-mile radius of the point of 
delivery of the livestock.
    Under 49 CFR 395.2, agricultural commodities include horticultural 
products at risk of perishing or degrading in quality during transport 
and non-processed food, feed, fiber, or livestock. Livestock includes 
insects and all other living animals cultivated, grown, or raised for 
commercial purposes, including aquatic animals. Farm supplies for 
agricultural purposes include products directly related to the growing 
or harvesting of agricultulral commodities during the planting and 
harvesting seasons within each State, and livestock feed.

Applicant's Request

    Protein Transport's application for exemption was described in 
detail in a Federal Register notice on July 1, 2025, (90 FR 28853) and 
will not be repeated as the facts have not changed.

IV. Public Comments

    The Agency received three comments, all of which opposed the 
exemption, emphasizing the applicant's lack of fatigue management 
measures. AWM Associates noted that the exemption application did not 
address fatigue management. The Truck Safety Coalition said that the 
application ``conspicuously lacks a single countermeasure that combats 
driver fatigue. Furthermore, its safety record is highly concerning and 
should give FMCSA tremendous pause.'' Advocates for Highway and Auto 
Safety noted that truck driver fatigue is a serious safety issue and 
that Protein Transport failed to include ``any additional procedures it 
will take beyond those already covered'' by regulation.

V. FMCSA Decision

    FMCSA evaluated Protein Transport's application and public comments 
and denies the exemption request. Congress created a statutory 
exemption from the HOS requirements for the transportation of 
agricultural commodities and farm supplies for agricultural purposes. 
The transportation of chicken products does not fall within the 
exemptions Congress established. Although such products may be included 
in animal feed, they are merely one such component and do not 
separately qualify as animal feed. In addition, as highlighted by the 
commenters, the exemption application contains no countermeasures to 
address driver fatigue. Protein Transport failed to establish that it 
would likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or 
greater than, the level that would be achieved without the exemption. 
In addition, FMCSA established the HOS rules following notice and 
comment rulemaking, based on research and data, to ensure the safe 
operation of CMVs on our nations' roadways. Accordingly, any exemption 
from the HOS regulations should be well supported to demonstrate why 
the exempted party would be able to achieve an equivalent or greater 
level of safety. To grant HOS exemptions without that level of 
confidence would be inconsistent with a primary goal of the HOS 
regulations to keep fatigued drivers off the public roadways and 
contrary to the statutory standard for an exemption. For the above 
reasons, the Protein Transport of Indiana, L.L.C. exemption application 
is denied.
