SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Throughout this document whenever ``we,''

I. What is the background for these actions?

    On January 7, 2025, Ohio submitted amendments to OAC 3745-25 as a 
revision to Ohio's SIP. The amendments to the rules make minor style 
changes, correct typographical errors, and update publication and 
referenced material titles, effective dates and addresses. These 
changes were made to rules 3745-25-01, 3745-25-02, 3745-25-03, 3745-25-
04 and 3745-25-05.
    On June 16, 2025, Ohio EPA adopted additional amendments to OAC 
3745-25. The amendment included an appendix that was unintentionally 
omitted from the January 7, 2025, submittal. Ohio submitted the request 
to EPA to include the appendix to OAC 3745-25-04 on July 15, 2025.
    On September 2, 2025, Ohio requested that EPA not act on paragraph 
(A)(4) of OAC 3745-25-02. At Ohio EPA's request, EPA will not take 
action on paragraph (A)(4) of OAC 3745-25-02.
    Ohio's amended rules do not revise emission limits, impact emission 
standards, or change the scope or intent of each amended rule. Ohio 
made minor verb tense and rule formatting changes to be consistent with 
State style and formatting guidelines. Ohio also revised publication 
and referenced material titles, dates, and websites to refer to more 
recent versions of each referenced publication. EPA finds that these 
rule changes are approvable since the changes are minor in nature and 
do not affect the scope or intent of the rules.

II. What action is EPA taking?

    EPA is approving Ohio's amendments to OAC Chapter 3745-25 into 
Ohio's SIP. EPA is approving amended rules 3745-25-01, 3745-25-02, 
3745-25-03, 3745-25-04 and 3745-25-05 submitted to EPA on January 7, 
2025, along with the supplemental submissions submitted on July 15, 
2025, and September 2, 2025. EPA is not acting on paragraph (A)(4) of 
OAC 3745-25-02.
    We are publishing this action without prior proposal because we 
view this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipate no adverse 
comments. However, in the proposed rules section of this Federal 
Register publication, we are publishing a separate document that will 
serve as the proposal to approve the State plan if relevant adverse 
written comments are filed. This rule will be effective January 26, 
2026 without further notice unless we receive relevant adverse written 
comments by December 26, 2025. If we receive such comments, we will 
withdraw this action before the effective date by publishing a 
subsequent document that will withdraw the final action. All public 
comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule 
based on the proposed action. EPA will not institute a second comment 
period. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do 
so at this time. Please note that if EPA receives adverse comment on an 
amendment, paragraph, or section of this rule and if that provision may 
be severed from the remainder of the rule, EPA may adopt as final those 
provisions of the rule that are not the subject of an adverse comment. 
If we do not receive any comments, this action will be effective 
January 26, 2026.

III. Incorporation by Reference

    In this rule, EPA is finalizing regulatory text that includes 
incorporation by reference. In accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 
51.5, EPA is finalizing the incorporation by reference of the Ohio 
Regulations described in section II of this preamble and set forth in 
the amendments to 40 CFR part 52 below. EPA has made, and will continue 
to make, these documents generally available through 
<a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a> and at the EPA Region 5 Office (please contact the 
person identified in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of 
this preamble for more information). Therefore, these materials have 
been approved by EPA for inclusion in the SIP, have been incorporated 
by reference by EPA into that plan, are fully federally enforceable 
under sections 110 and 113 of the Clean Air Act as of the effective 
date of the final rulemaking of EPA's approval, and will

[[Page 54237]]

be incorporated by reference in the next update to the SIP 
compilation.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 62 FR 27968 (May 22, 1997).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

    Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a 
SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 
and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). 
Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve State 
choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. 
Accordingly, this action merely approves State law as meeting Federal 
requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those 
imposed by State law. For that reason, this action:
    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review 
by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (58 
FR 51735, October 4, 1993);
    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, 
February 6, 2025) because SIP actions are exempt from review under 
Executive Order 12866;
    <bullet> Does not impose an information collection burden under the 
provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);
    <bullet> Is certified as not having a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
    <bullet> Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);
    <bullet> Does not have federalism implications as specified in 
Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);
    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, 
April 23, 1997) because it approves a State program;
    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to 
Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and
    <bullet> Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the 
National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 
note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent 
with the Clean Air Act.
    In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian 
reservation land or in any other area where EPA or an Indian Tribe has 
demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian 
country, the rule does not have Tribal implications and will not impose 
substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law as 
specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).
    This action is subject to the Congressional Review Act, and EPA 
will submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the 
Comptroller General of the United States. This action is not a ``major 
rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).
    Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for 
judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court 
of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by January 26, 2026. Filing a 
petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule 
does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of 
judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for 
judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness 
of such rule or action. Parties with objections to this direct final 
rule are encouraged to file a comment in response to the parallel 
notice of proposed rulemaking for this action published in the proposed 
rules section of this Federal Register. rather than file an immediate 
petition for judicial review of this direct final rule, so that EPA can 
withdraw this direct final rule and address the comment in the proposed 
rulemaking. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to 
enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
