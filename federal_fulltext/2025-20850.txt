SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to section 401(a) of the CSPIA, the 
Department of Labor (the Department) and HHS jointly promulgated the 
National Medical Support Notice Final Rule on December 27, 2000 (65 FR 
82128) (NMSN Regulation). The NMSN Regulation simplifies the issuance 
and processing of medical child support orders; standardizes 
communication between State agencies, employers, and Plan 
Administrators; and creates a uniform and streamlined process for 
enforcement of medical child support to ensure that all eligible 
children receive the health care coverage to which they are entitled.
    The NMSN Regulation, codified at 29 CFR 2590.609-2, includes a 
model National Medical Support Notice (NMSN) that is comprised of two 
parts: part A is a notice from the State agency to the employer, 
entitled: ``Notice to Withhold for Health Care Coverage;'' and part B 
is a notice from the employer to the Plan Administrator, entitled: 
``Medical Support Notice to Plan Administrator.'' Both parts have 
detailed instructions informing the recipient to whom responses are due 
depending on varying circumstances. This ICR addresses the Plan 
Administrator's responsibilities under NMSN Regulation to complete part 
B of the NMSN, the ``Plan Administrator Response,'' pursuant to the 
CSPIA and section 609(a)(5)(C) of title I of ERISA.
    The ``Plan Administrator Response'' in part B of the NMSN requires 
the Plan Administrator to provide information verifying whether the 
child is or will be receiving health care coverage from the group 
health plan. If enrollment has already occurred or can begin 
immediately, the Plan Administrator's response in part B serves as 
notice to the State agency, the participant (parent), the child, their 
non-participant parent or guardian and the employer that the child is 
or will begin receiving dependent health care coverage pursuant to the 
group health plan. When the child is eligible for more than one 
coverage option, the Administrator must first send the part B response 
to the State agency so that the agency may choose one option. The Plan 
Administrator must also use the part B response to notify all of the 
above-affected persons of any waiting period before enrollment of the 
child can occur. For additional substantive information about this ICR, 
see the related notice published in the Federal Register on January 6, 
2025 (90 FR 671).
    Comments are invited on: (1) whether the collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Department, including whether the information will have practical 
utility; (2) the accuracy of the agency's estimates of the burden and 
cost of the collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility and clarity of the information collection; and (4) ways to 
minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are 
to respond, including the use of automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology.
    This information collection is subject to the PRA. A Federal agency 
generally cannot conduct or sponsor a collection of information, and 
the public is generally not required to respond to an information 
collection, unless the OMB approves it and displays a currently valid 
OMB Control Number. In addition, notwithstanding any other provisions 
of law, no person shall generally be subject to penalty for failing to 
comply with a collection of information that does not display a valid 
OMB Control Number. See 5 CFR 1320.5(a) and 1320.6.
    DOL seeks PRA authorization for this information collection for 
three (3) years. OMB authorization for an ICR cannot be for more than 
three (3) years without renewal. The DOL notes that information 
collection requirements submitted to the OMB for existing ICRs receive 
a month-to-month extension while they undergo review.
    Agency: DOL-EBSA.
    Title of Collection: National Medical Support Notice--Part B.
    OMB Control Number: 1210-0113.
    Affected Public: Private sector.
    Total Estimated Number of Respondents: 399,269.
    Total Estimated Number of Responses: 10,753,708.
    Total Estimated Annual Time Burden: 896,142 hours.
    Total Estimated Annual Other Costs Burden: $5,927,982.
