Project Description

    Nueva Era Dos proposes to construct, operate and maintain a natural 
gas pipeline crossing the United States-Mexico border. According to 
Nueva Era Dos, its project would provide a new international 
interconnection primarily designed to deliver about one billion 
standard cubic feet of natural gas per day to industrial customers in 
Mexico. This pipeline would be capable of exporting and importing 
natural gas. The Project would consist of approximately 3,603 feet of 
36-inch-diameter natural gas transmission pipeline installed via a 
horizontal directional drill in Maverick County, Texas.

Background

    On September 5, the Commission issued a Notice of Scoping Period 
Requesting Comments on Environmental Issues for the Proposed Nueva Era 
Dos Pipeline Project and Notice of Public Scoping Session (Notice of 
Scoping). The Notice of Scoping was sent to affected landowners; 
federal, state, and local government agencies; elected officials; 
environmental and public interest groups; Native American tribes; other 
interested parties; and local libraries and newspapers. In response to 
the Notice of Scoping, the Commission received comments from the United 
States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In its comments, the EPA 
recommend the EA address the environmental effects that construction, 
operation, and maintenance of the Project would have on air quality and 
water quality. The EPA also recommended that the EA address 
construction-related hazardous materials and waste. All substantive 
comments will be addressed in the EA.

Additional Information

    In order to receive notification of the issuance of the EA and to 
keep track of formal issuances and submittals in specific dockets, the 
Commission offers a free service called eSubscription. This service 
provides automatic notification of filings made to subscribed dockets, 
document summaries, and direct links to the documents. Go to <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/ferc-online/overview">https://www.ferc.gov/ferc-online/overview</a> to register for eSubscription.
