    Title: Establishing Property Suitability for VA Specially Adapted 
Housing.
    OMB Control Number: 202503-2900-014 <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRASearch">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRASearch</a> (Once at this link, you can enter the OMB Control Number 
to find the historical versions of this Information Collection).
    Type of Review: New Collection (Request for a new OMB Control 
Number).
    Abstract: The Report of Loan Guaranty Existing Housing Unit 
Inspection of SAH Property Suitability (VA Form 26-1858a-ARE), Report 
of Loan Guaranty SHA Property Suitability (VA 26-1858b), Report of Loan 
Guaranty SAH Vacant Lot Inspection (VA Form 26-1858c-ARE), Report of 
Loan Guaranty Final SAH/SHA Field Review (VA Form 26-1858d) are used to 
assess the suitability and condition of properties under the VA's 
Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) program. The information collected in 
this process assists Veterans who are entitled to adapted housing 
grants itemized under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 21 Sec.  2101 (a) who may use 
their benefit to ``acquire a suitable housing unit'' that will provide 
a barrier-free living space based on ``the nature of the Veteran's 
disability''. Per 38 U.S.C. Chapter 21 Sec.  2101 (a)3, determinations 
must be made regarding the feasibility and suitability of a proposed 
property. Information must be gathered to make such determinations. 38 
CFR 36.4404 (b) requires that the VA establish if it is medically 
feasible for the Veteran to reside outside an institutional setting, 
that the proposed housing unit is suitable for the Veteran's needs and 
that the cost of the proposed housing unit bears a proper relation to 
the Veteran's present and anticipated income and expenses. The 
information being sought is both required and necessary to make an 
accurate analysis that may support these conclusions.
    Affected Public: Individuals and households.
    Estimated Annual Burden: 2,695 Hours.
    Estimated Average Burden per Respondent: 15 minutes (to complete 
forms)/45 minutes (to take photos and measurements).
    Frequency of Response: Annually.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 6,628.
    Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

Acting VA PRA Clearance Officer, (Alt) Office of Enterprise and 
Integration/Data Governance Analytics, Department of Veterans Affairs.
