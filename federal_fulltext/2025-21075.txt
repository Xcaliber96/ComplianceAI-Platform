[Docket No. FDA-2025-N-1137]


Nicole Shelby Randall: Final Debarment Order

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) is 
issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C 
Act) debarring Nicole Shelby Randall for a period of 5 years from 
importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA 
bases this order on a finding that Ms. Randall was convicted of one 
felony count under Federal law for introduction of an adulterated drug 
into interstate commerce. The factual basis supporting Ms. Randall's 
conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation 
into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Ms. Randall 
was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity 
to request a hearing to show why she should not be debarred. As of July 
30, 2025 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Ms. Randall had not 
responded. Ms. Randall's failure to respond and request a hearing 
constitutes a waiver of her right to a hearing concerning this matter.

DATES: This order is applicable November 25, 2025.

ADDRESSES: Any application by Ms. Randall for termination of debarment 
under section 306(d)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 335a(d)(1)) may be 
submitted at any time as follows:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    Section 306(b)(1)(D) of the FD&C Act permits debarment of an 
individual from importing or offering for import any drug into the 
United States if FDA finds, as required by section 306(b)(3)(C) of the 
FD&C Act, that the individual has been convicted of a felony for 
conduct relating to the importation into the United States of any drug 
or controlled substance.
    On January 22, 2025, Ms. Randall was convicted as defined in 
section 306(l)(1) of the FD&C Act, in the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Oregon, when the court accepted her plea of guilty and 
entered judgment against her for the felony offense of introduction of 
an adulterated drug into interstate commerce in violation of sections 
301(a) and 303(a)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(a) and 333(a)(2)). 
The underlying facts supporting the conviction are as follows: As 
contained in the Information and Plea Agreement from her case, 
beginning on or about February 2020, and continuing through on or about 
May 2022, Ms. Randall along with co-conspirators operated a scheme to 
import and distribute GS-441524, a new drug, within the United States. 
This drug, GS-441524, has not been approved by FDA for human or animal 
use. To mislead and defraud U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
officers, Ms. Randall imported GS-441524 from China and Hong Kong 
disguised in boxes marked ``Facial Mask'' and ``Pet Shampoo'' and 
declared to CBP as ``Beauty Essence Products,'' ``Cosmetics,'' 
``Essence Water,'' and ``Beauty Facial Masks.'' Through the private 
Facebook Group, ``FIP Warriors 5.0,'' Ms. Randall marketed GS-441524. 
Despite having no veterinary or prescriber licenses, Ms. Randall 
defrauded and mislead her customers by ``diagnosing'' their cats and 
kittens with Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) and ``prescribing'' 
GS-441524 for the animal's consumption. On or about August 12, 2021, 
and as part of an undercover law enforcement operations, Ms. Randall 
``diagnosed'' a healthy cat with FIP and ``prescribed'' GS-441524 for 
consumption. After receiving payment, Ms. Randall introduced GS-441524 
into interstate commerce by mailing it to the undercover agents.
    FDA sent Ms. Randall, by certified mail, on June 25, 2025, a notice 
proposing to debar her for a 5-year period from importing or offering 
for import any drug into the United States. The proposal was based on a 
finding under section 306(b)(3)(C) of the FD&C Act that Ms. Randall's 
felony conviction under Federal law for introduction of an adulterated 
drug into interstate commerce in violation of sections 301(a) and 
303(a)(2) of the FD&C Act was for conduct relating to the importation 
of any drug or controlled substance into the United States because Ms. 
Randall illegally imported and introduced misbranded drug products into 
interstate commerce. In proposing a debarment period, FDA weighed the 
considerations set forth in section 306(c)(3) of the FD&C Act that the 
Agency considered applicable to Ms. Randall's offense and concluded 
that the offense warranted the imposition of a 5-year period of 
debarment.
    The proposal informed Ms. Randall of the proposed debarment and 
offered her an opportunity to request a hearing, providing her 30 days 
from the date of receipt of the letter in which to file the request, 
and advised her that failure to request a hearing constituted a waiver 
of the opportunity for a hearing and of any contentions concerning this 
action. Ms. Randall received the proposal and notice of opportunity for 
a hearing on June 30, 2025. Ms. Randall failed to request a hearing 
within the timeframe prescribed by regulation and has, therefore, 
waived her opportunity for a hearing and waived any contentions 
concerning her debarment (21 CFR part 12).

II. Findings and Order

    Therefore, the Division of Field Enforcement, Office of Inspections 
and Investigations, under section 306(b)(3)(C) of the FD&C Act, under 
authority delegated to the Director, Division of Enforcement, finds 
that Ms. Nicole Shelby Randall has been convicted of a felony under 
Federal law for conduct relating to the importation into the United 
States of any drug or controlled substance. FDA finds that the offense 
should be accorded a debarment period of 5 years as provided by section 
306(c)(2)(A)(iii) of the FD&C Act.
    As a result of the foregoing finding, Ms. Randall is debarred for a 
period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into 
the United States, effective (see DATES). Pursuant to section 301(cc) 
of the FD&C Act, the importing or offering for import into the United 
States of any drug by, with the

[[Page 53329]]

assistance of, or at the direction of Ms. Randall is a prohibited act.

Lowell M. Zeta,
Acting Deputy Commissioner for Policy, Legislation, and International 
Affairs.
