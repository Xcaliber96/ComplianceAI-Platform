Postal Service must be addressed to: Debbie-Anne A. Reese, Secretary, 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street NE, Room 1A, 
Washington, DC 20426. Submissions sent via any other carrier must be

    The Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure require all 
intervenors filing documents with the Commission to serve a copy of 
that document on each person on the official service list for the 
project. Further, if an intervenor files comments or documents with the 
Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the 
responsibilities of a particular resource agency, they must also serve 
a copy of the document on that resource agency.
    k. This application has been accepted for filing, but is not ready 
for environmental analysis at this time.
    Project Description: The existing project consists of a dam that 
includes three 12-foot-long Tainter gates with a crest elevation of 
770.8 National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD 29); and a 
powerhouse that includes an intake structure with a trashrack with 2-
inch clear bar spacing and a 210-kilowatt vertical Francis turbine-
generator unit. The dam creates an impoundment that has a surface area 
of 235 acres at a normal surface elevation of 770.2 feet NGVD 29. From 
the impoundment, water flows through the powerhouse to a tailrace that 
empties into the Waupaca River.
    Electricity generated at the powerhouse is transmitted to the 
electric grid via 4.16-kilovolt generator lead lines, a step-up 
transformer, and a 25-foot-long transmission line.
    Project recreation facilities include: (1) a boat ramp that 
provides impoundment access; (2) an approximately 270-foot-long access 
road for the boat ramp; (3) a 100-foot-long portage trail; and (4) a 
hand-carry boat put-in site downstream of the dam.
    Wiscons8 proposes to continue operating the project in a run-of-
river mode and maintaining the impoundment elevation at 770.2 <plus-
minus> 0.25 feet NGVD 29. Wiscons8 also proposes to continue 
maintaining the portage trail and put-in site. The put-in site also 
includes a dock that Wiscons8 proposes to maintain for public tailrace 
fishing. Wiscons8 is not proposing to maintain the boat ramp or 270-
foot-long access road as project facilities.
    l. A copy of the application can be viewed on the Commission's 
website at <a href="http://www.ferc.gov">http://www.ferc.gov</a> using the ``eLibrary'' link. Enter the
