Project Description

    Texas Eastern proposes to abandon and remove three natural gas-
fired turbine compressor units and ten reciprocating compressor units 
at the existing Danville Compressor Station and replace them with three 
new gas-fired turbine compressor units. According to Texas Eastern, the 
new units would replace units installed in the 1950s and 1960s, 
ensuring continued safe, efficient, and reliable operation of the 
compressor station while meeting air emissions requirements.
