SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[OMB Control No. 3235-0766]


Agency Information Collection Activities; Proposed Collection; 
Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17a-14 and Form CRS

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
proposed collection of information provided for in Rule 17a-14 (17 CFR 
240.17a-14) and Form CRS (17 CFR 249.640), under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 17a-14 and Form CRS require a broker-dealer that offers 
services to retail investors to prepare and file with the Commission 
through WebCRD, post to the broker-dealer's website (if it has one), 
and deliver to retail investors a relationship summary. The 
relationship summary can assist retail investors in making an informed 
choice about whether to hire or retain a broker-dealer, as well as what 
types of accounts and services are appropriate for their needs.
    The information that must be collected pursuant to Rule 17a-14 and 
Form CRS is necessary to provide broker-dealer retail customers, 
prospective retail customers, and the Commission with information about 
the relationships and services the firm offers to retail investors, 
fees and costs that the retail investor will pay, specific conflicts of 
interest and standards of conduct, legal or disciplinary history, and 
how to obtain additional information about the firm. The Commission 
uses the information to manage its regulatory and examination programs. 
Retail investors can use the information required in the relationship 
summary to determine whether to hire or retain a broker-dealer, as well 
as what types of accounts and services are appropriate for their needs. 
The information will therefore help establish a framework that protects 
investors and promotes efficiency, competition, and capital formation.
    The aggregate annual hour burden for all respondents to comply with 
the information collection requirements of Rule 17a-14 and Form CRS is 
estimated to be approximately 6,426,099 hours per year. Under Rule 17a-
14 and Form CRS, respondents will also incur cost burdens. The 
aggregate annual cost burden for all respondents is estimated to be 
approximately $142,554 per year.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB Control Number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the SEC, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the SEC's estimate of the burden 
imposed by the proposed collection of information, including the 
validity of the methodology and the assumptions used; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated, 
electronic collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology.
    Please direct your written comment on this 60-Day Collection Notice 
to Austin Gerig, Director/Chief Data
