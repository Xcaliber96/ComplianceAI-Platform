Containing Cosmetic Products; Withdrawal

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human 
Services.

[[Page 54604]]


ACTION: Proposed rule; withdrawal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is 
announcing the withdrawal of the proposed rule entitled ``Testing 
Methods for Detecting and Identifying Asbestos in Talc-Containing 
Cosmetic Products,'' which published in the Federal Register of 
December 27, 2024. FDA is taking this action in response to comments 
received during the comment period for the proposed rule that warrant 
further consideration and assessment prior to issuing final regulations 
to establish and require standardized testing methods for detecting and 
identifying asbestos in talc-containing cosmetic products pursuant to 
the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022.

DATES: The proposed rule published December 27, 2024 (89 FR 105490) is 
withdrawn as of November 28, 2025.

Analyst, Food and Drug Administration, 240-402-4565,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of December 27, 2024 
(89 FR 105490), FDA issued the proposed rule entitled ``Testing Methods 
for Detecting and Identifying Asbestos in Talc-Containing Cosmetic 
Products'' as part of its implementation of the Modernization of 
Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022 (MoCRA), which requires the 
promulgation of proposed and final regulations to establish and require 
standardized testing methods for detecting and identifying asbestos in 
talc-containing cosmetic products.
    The proposed rule, if finalized, would require manufacturers of 
talc-containing cosmetic products to test their talc-containing 
cosmetic products or the talc cosmetic ingredient prior to using the 
talc to manufacture a talc-containing cosmetic for asbestos, and to 
keep records to demonstrate compliance with the rule. Failure to comply 
with the rule's testing or recordkeeping obligations would result in 
FDA deeming a cosmetic product to be adulterated under the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as would the presence of any 
asbestos in a talc-containing cosmetic product, talc used in a cosmetic 
product, or talc intended for use in a cosmetic. FDA received 49 
comments on the proposed rule.
    FDA proposed that the rule would apply to all manufacturers of 
talc-containing cosmetic products, including cosmetic products that are 
subject to the requirements of chapter V of the FD&C Act (Drugs and 
Devices). Therefore, the proposed rule, if finalized, would apply to 
cosmetic products that are also drugs. FDA received comments that 
suggested the proposed rule would have unintended consequences for many 
consumer products containing talc, including but not limited to talc-
containing cosmetic products.
    FDA proposed to define ``asbestos'' to include ``amosite, 
chrysotile, crocidolite; asbestiform tremolite, actinolite, 
anthophyllite, winchite, and richterite; and other asbestiform 
amphibole minerals.'' FDA received comments that requested consistency 
with the established definitions or approaches used by other Federal 
agencies, including the Department of Labor (Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration) and 
Environmental Protection Agency, to avoid unnecessary confusion.
    MoCRA requires FDA to establish and require standardized testing 
methods for detecting and identifying asbestos in talc-containing 
cosmetic products. The proposed rule was issued pursuant to MoCRA and 
sections 601 and 701 of the FD&C Act. FDA received comments regarding 
the Agency's statutory authority under law to add a specific 
adulteration provision relating to talc testing and regarding its 
authority to consider a cosmetic containing any amount of asbestos to 
be adulterated.
    Good cause exists to withdraw the proposed rule at this time. On 
the basis of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) priorities to ensure 
safe additives in the American food and drug supply, the highly 
scientific and technical issues addressed in public comments the Agency 
has received, and the complexity of asbestos testing and legal 
considerations under the Administrative Procedure Act, we are 
withdrawing the proposed rule to reconsider best means of addressing 
the issues covered by the proposed rule and broader principles to 
reduce exposure to asbestos, and to ensure that any standardized 
testing method requirements for detecting asbestos in talc-containing 
cosmetic products help protect users of talc-containing cosmetic 
products from harmful exposure to asbestos.
    While the Agency is withdrawing the proposed rule, FDA will issue a 
proposed rule to meet its statutory obligations under section 3505 of 
MoCRA.

Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services.
