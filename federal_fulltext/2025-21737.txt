[Docket No. FSIS-2025-0180]


Delayed Verification Sampling of Not Ready-to-Eat Breaded Stuffed 
Chicken Products

AGENCY: Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA).

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: FSIS is delaying the implementation of its verification 
activities related to Salmonella in not ready-to-eat (NRTE) breaded 
stuffed chicken product because of current testing method limitations. 
The current available test methods have accuracy limitations and have 
resulted in findings of false positives, especially at low levels of 
contamination.

DATES: FSIS will not begin sampling and testing NRTE breaded stuffed 
chicken or other verification activities related to that product on 
November 3, 2025.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Rachel Edelstein, Assistant 
Administrator, Office of Policy and Program Development by telephone at 
(202) 205-0495.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FSIS is the public health agency within the 
USDA responsible for ensuring that meat, poultry, and egg products are 
safe, wholesome, and properly labeled. In support of this mission, FSIS 
published a final determination in the Federal Register on May 1, 2024, 
declaring that NRTE breaded stuffed chicken products containing 
Salmonella at levels of 1 colony forming unit per gram (1 CFU/g) or 
higher are adulterated under the Poultry Products Inspection Act 
(PPIA)(21 U.S.C. 453 (g)(1) and (3))(89 FR 35033).
    The final determination also announced FSIS' intention to implement 
sampling and testing of raw incoming chicken components used to produce 
NRTE breaded stuffed chicken products (88 FR 35033, 35050-35051). The 
testing program was initially set to begin on May 1, 2025. On April 11, 
2025, FSIS extended the start date until November 3, 2025, to give the 
Agency additional time to finalize relevant guidance and instructions 
and to prepare laboratories for sampling and testing (90 FR 15433).
    FSIS is now announcing a further delay in the implementation of 
verification sampling and testing and other verification activities for 
NRTE breaded stuffed chicken products. The available methods, including 
the reference method Most Probable Number (MPN) have accuracy 
limitations and have resulted in findings of false positives for 
Salmonella at 1 CFU/g; that is, there have been instances in which some 
product that in fact contains less than 1 CFU/g has tested positive.
    Specifically, an evaluation study conducted by the Agricultural 
Research Service (ARS),\1\ tested source material for NRTE breaded 
stuffed chicken, consistent with the sampling approach FSIS planned to 
use and found false positives. According to the study, under the 
specific method \2\ FSIS planned to use, if a sample contains 
Salmonella at a concentration of 0.9 CFU/g, there is a 75% chance the 
method will report >= 1 CFU/g. If a sample is 0.5 CFU/g, there would 
still be a 40% chance the method would report >= 1 CFU/g. As a result, 
moving forward with the current testing method could lead to 
enforcement actions against products that are positive for Salmonella 
at less than 1 CFU/g and are, therefore, not adulterated based on the 
final determination published May 1, 2024 (89 FR 35033).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Applying a quantitative threshold (i.e., 1 CFU/g) for Salmonella in 
raw poultry is a regulatory approach the Agency has not taken before. 
FSIS has historically relied on presence or absence testing to verify 
whether product is adulterated based on pathogen testing (e.g., when 
testing ready-to-eat product for Listeria monocytogenes or Salmonella 
or applicable raw beef product for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia 
coli).
    Given the implications of enforcement based on a specific numerical 
threshold, FSIS needs additional time to reevaluate the testing program 
and determine its viability moving forward.
    This delay reflects FSIS' commitment to ensuring that enforcement 
decisions are based on data that are not only scientifically valid, but 
also operationally reliable, reproducible, and fair. This delay also 
gives industry more time to implement controls to reduce Salmonella in 
source components used to produce NRTE breaded stuffed chicken.
    At this time, FSIS is not establishing a new implementation date. 
The duration of the delay will depend largely on whether the Agency is 
able to refine the current method or develop and validate an 
alternative method that can be reliably applied in a regulatory 
context. FSIS will provide advance notice in the Federal Register 
before beginning verification sampling and testing activities.

Additional Public Notification

    Public awareness of all segments of rulemaking and policy 
development is important. Consequently, FSIS will announce this Federal 
Register publication on-line through the FSIS web page located at: 
<a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/federal-register">https://www.fsis.usda.gov/federal-register</a>.
    FSIS will also announce and provide a link to this Federal Register 
publication through the FSIS Constituent Update, which is used to 
provide information regarding FSIS policies, procedures, regulations, 
Federal Register notices, FSIS public meetings, and other types of
