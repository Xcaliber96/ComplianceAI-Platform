Part 382

AGENCY: Maritime Administration (MARAD), U.S. Department of

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: MARAD invites public comments on its intention to request 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information 
collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The 
proposed collection OMB 2133-0514 (Determination of Fair and Reasonable 
Rates for Carriage of Agriculture Cargoes on U.S.-Flag Commercial 
Vessels--46 CFR Part 382) is used to determine fair and reasonable 
guideline rates for the carriage of preference cargoes on U.S.-flag 
commercial vessels. Since the last renewal, the public burden decreased 
due to fewer respondents. MARAD is required to publish this notice in 
the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and affected 
agencies.

DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before January 27, 2026.

ADDRESSES: You may submit comments identified by Docket No. MARAD-2025-

    Comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed collection of 
information is necessary for the Department's performance; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimated burden; (c) ways for the Department to
