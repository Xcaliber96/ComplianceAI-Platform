Agency Information Collection Activities: Submission for OMB 
Review; Comment Request

AGENCY: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Health and Human 
Services (HHS).

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is 
announcing an opportunity for the public to comment on CMS' intention 
to collect information from the public. Under the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (PRA), federal agencies are required to publish notice in 
the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each proposed extension or reinstatement of an 
existing collection of information, and to allow a second opportunity 
for public comment on the notice. Interested persons are invited to 
send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this 
collection of information, including the necessity and utility of the 
proposed information collection for the proper performance of the 
agency's functions, the accuracy of the estimated burden, ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be 
collected, and the use of automated collection techniques or other 
forms of information technology to minimize the information collection 
burden.

DATES: Comments on the collection(s) of information must be received by 
the OMB desk officer by December 31, 2025.

ADDRESSES: Written comments and recommendations for the proposed 
information collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of 
this notice to <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a>. Find this particular 
information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day Review--
Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function.
    To obtain copies of a supporting statement and any related forms 
for the proposed collection(s) summarized in this notice, please access 
the CMS PRA website by copying and pasting the following web address 
into your web browser: <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/PaperworkReductionActof1995/PRA-Listing">https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/PaperworkReductionActof1995/PRA-Listing</a>

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Parham at (410) 786-4669.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), federal agencies must obtain approval from 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for each collection of 
information they conduct or sponsor. The term ``collection of 
information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and 
includes agency requests or requirements that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a third party. 
Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)) requires 
federal agencies to publish a 30-day notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed collection of information, including each 
proposed extension or reinstatement of an existing collection of 
information, before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, CMS is publishing this notice that 
summarizes the following proposed collection(s) of information for 
public comment.
    1. Type of Information Collection Request: Extension of a currently 
approved collection; Title of Information Collection: CLIA Proficiency 
Testing (PT); Use: This is an extension package. The purpose of this 
package is to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval 
for the information collection request (ICR) for proficiency testing 
(PT) and reapproval of PT programs. The ICR includes laboratories 
filling in PT submission forms for microbiology PT and document 
collection for a PT program if it needs to reapply for approval using 
the initial approval process.
    On October 31, 1988, Congress enacted the Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-578) (CLIA'88), codified at 
42 U.S.C. 263a, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of testing in 
all laboratories, including, but not limited to, those that participate 
in Medicare and Medicaid, that test human specimens for purpose of 
providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of 
any disease or impairment, or the assessment of health, of human 
beings. The Secretary established the initial regulations implementing 
CLIA on February 28, 1992 at 42 CFR part 493 (57 FR 7002). Among other 
things, those regulations required laboratories conducting moderate or 
high complexity testing to enroll in an approved PT program for each 
specialty, subspecialty, and analyte or test for which the laboratory 
is certified under CLIA. PT evaluates a laboratory's performance by 
testing of unknown samples just as it would test patient samples.
    A Health and Human Services (HHS)-approved PT program sends unknown 
samples to a laboratory for analysis. After testing, the laboratory 
reports its results to the PT program. The program grades the results 
using the CLIA grading criteria and provides the laboratory with its 
scores. PT is crucial to maintaining the quality of laboratory testing 
because it independently verifies the accuracy and reliability of 
laboratory testing, including the competency of testing personnel. PT 
referral was further addressed by enactment of the Taking Essential 
Steps for Testing Act of 2012 (Pub. L. 112-202, December 4, 2012) (TEST 
Act) and our implementing regulations (79 FR 25435 and 79 FR 27105). As 
of July 2025, there were 307,193 CLIA-certified laboratories, of which 
33,990 Certificate of Compliance (CoC) and Certificate of Accreditation 
(CoA) laboratories were required to enroll in an HHS-approved PT 
program and comply with the PT regulations.
    Testing has evolved significantly since 1992, and technology is now 
more accurate and precise than the methods in use at the time the PT 
regulations became effective for all laboratories in 1994. In addition, 
many tests for analytes for which PT was not initially required are now 
in routine clinical use. For example, tests for cardiac markers, such 
as troponins, and hemoglobin A1c test commonly used to monitor glycemic 
control in persons with diabetes, were not routinely performed prior to 
1992. Recognizing these changes, we finalized revisions to our existing 
PT regulations in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 
1988 (CLIA) Proficiency Testing Regulations Related to Analytes and 
Acceptable Performance (CMS 3355-F) which published July 11, 2022 (87 
FR 41194). Each PT program supplies laboratories with its forms 
required for enrolling in microbiology PT; and reapplication for 
approval has no standardized forms required.
    The original CLIA regulation PRA Supporting Statement for CLIA (OMB 
control number: 0938-0612) did not include the collection requirements 
for microbiology PT provisions or PT programs included in this final 
rule. We determined during the proposed rule phase that this ICR would 
be needed to cover the additional information collections. We plan to 
include these two information collections when the

[[Page 55130]]

PRA package under OMB control number: 0938-0612 is due for renewal.
    Laboratories are currently required to report PT results for 
microbiology organism identification to the highest level that they 
report results on patient specimens. We are clarifying that this is 
required when reporting microbiology PT results to PT programs. The 
information that the laboratory submits to the PT program will be used 
by the PT program to determine successful participation in PT. Form 
Number: CMS-10690 (OMB control number: 0938-1357); Frequency: Yearly; 
Affected Public: Private sector--Not-for-profit organizations; Number 
of Respondents: 1,335; Total Annual Responses: 1,335 Total Annual 
Hours: 1,407. (For policy questions regarding this collection contact
