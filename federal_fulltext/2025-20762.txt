I. Background

    3. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct 1992) required the 
Commission to establish a ``simplified and generally applicable'' 
ratemaking methodology that was consistent with the just and reasonable 
standard of the Interstate Commerce Act.\5\ To implement this mandate, 
the Commission issued Order No. 561 establishing an indexing 
methodology that allows oil pipelines to change rates based upon an 
annual index as opposed to making cost-of-service filings.\6\ The use 
of an industry-wide index avoids expensive and time-consuming 
proceedings associated with cost-of-service ratemaking and litigation 
for individual pipelines while still allowing pipelines to efficiently 
set rates that are commensurate with industry-wide costs. Furthermore, 
updating the index every five years to reflect oil pipeline industry 
costs changes helps ensure that rates are just and reasonable for 
shippers and pipelines. Each year, pipelines adjust their rate ceilings 
effective July 1 using an index multiplier that the Commission 
publishes in May based on recent changes in the PPI-FG (a measure of 
inflation) and the current index level.\7\

1992), codified at 42 U.S.C. 7172 note.

index for the July 1, 2025--June 30, 2026, index year using the 
index level established in the 2020 five-year review).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. In this proceeding, the Commission is conducting its five-year 
review of the oil pipeline index level. When the Commission established 
indexing in Order No. 561, the Commission committed to review the index 
level every five years to ensure that the index level chosen by the 
Commission adequately reflects changes to industry costs and to ensure 
that oil pipeline indexed rates remain just and reasonable.\8\ The 
Commission explained that its responsibilities under the ICA, to both 
shippers and pipelines, require monitoring of the relationship between 
the change in the chosen index level and the actual cost changes 
experienced by industry.\9\ On appeal of Order No. 561, the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. 
Circuit) upheld the indexing methodology based in part on the 
Commission's commitment to undertake regular five-year reviews.\10\ 
Since 2000,\11\ the Commission has conducted a review of the index 
level every five years.\12\ While continuing to use PPI-FG

[[Page 52904]]

as the basis of the index level,\13\ the Commission has recalibrated 
the index level each time so that it continued to reflect the 
relationship between oil pipeline cost changes and PPI-FG.\14\ The 
generally applicable changes to the oil pipeline index necessarily 
require notice and comment rulemaking.\15\

    \15\ See LEPA v. FERC, 109 F.4th at 549 (holding that the 
Commission could not revise the index level without adhering to 
notice and comment procedures required by the Administrative 
Procedure Act).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    5. In Order No. 561 and each successive five-year index review, the 
Commission has calculated the index level based upon a methodology 
originally developed by Dr. Alfred E. Kahn and modified by the 
Commission in subsequent five-year reviews.\16\ The Kahn Methodology 
uses pipeline data from Form No. 6, page 700 \17\ from the prior five-
year period to determine adjustments to be applied to the PPI-FG. The 
calculation is as follows. Each pipeline's cost change on a per barrel-
mile basis over the prior five-year period (e.g., the years 2019-2024 
in this proceeding) is calculated. In order to remove statistical 
outliers and spurious data, the Kahn Methodology trims an equal number 
of pipelines from the top and bottom of the data set.\18\ The Kahn 
Methodology then calculates three measures of central tendency for the 
trimmed data sample: the median, the mean, and a weighted mean.\19\ The 
Kahn Methodology calculates a composite by averaging these three 
measures of central tendency and measures the difference between the 
composite and the PPI-FG over the prior five-year period. The index 
level is then set at PPI-FG plus (or minus) this differential.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ The Commission's use of the Kahn Methodology has been 
affirmed by the D.C. Circuit. AOPL I, 83 F.3d 1424; Flying J Inc. v. 
FERC, 363 F.3d 495.
    \17\ 2015 Index Review, 153 FERC ] 61,312 at P 12 (updating the 
Commission's calculation of the five-year oil pipeline index to use 
page 700 data to measure changing barrel-mile costs), aff'd, AOPL 
III, 876 F.3d at 345-46. Page 700 provides summarized interstate 
barrel-mile and cost-of-service data consistent with the 
Commission's cost-of-service methodology. Id. PP 12-13, 16.
    \18\ For example, the Commission has previously trimmed the data 
set to the middle 50% (removing the bottom 25% and top 25% of 
pipelines) and in 2020, for the 2021-2026 five-year index, changed 
to using the middle 80% (removing the bottom 10% and top 10% of 
pipelines). 2020 Index Order, 173 FERC ] 61,245 at PP 25-32 (using 
the middle 80%); 2015 Index Review, 153 FERC ] 61,312 at PP 42-44 
(using the middle 50%); 2010 Index Review, 133 FERC ] 61,228 at PP

50%); see also 2005 Index Review, 114 FERC ] 61,293 at P 28 
(considering average of the middle 50% and middle 80%); 2000 Remand 
Order, 102 FERC ] 61,295 at P 24 (same).
    \19\ The weighted mean assigns a different weight to each 
pipeline's cost change based on the pipeline's total barrel-miles.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Commission Proposal

    6. We propose PPI-FG minus 1.42% as the index level for the five-
year period commencing July 1, 2026. The proposal is based on the Kahn 
Methodology as applied to Form No. 6, page 700 data from the 2019 
through 2024 period. The Commission's calculations are included in 
workpapers included as Attachment A and available in this docket on the 
Commission's eLibrary system.\20\ This proposal is subject to change 
based on the Commission's review of the record developed in this 
proceeding.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See infra P 37 (discussing the Commission's eLibrary 
system).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7. We invite interested persons to submit comments regarding the 
Commission's proposal and any alternative methodologies for calculating 
the index level for the five-year period commencing July 1, 2026.\21\ 
Commenters may address all issues relating to the calculation of the 
index level, including, but not limited to: (i) different data trimming 
methodologies; (ii) whether, and if so how, the Commission should 
adjust the data set to address the effects of the change in Commission 
policy regarding return on equity (ROE); and (iii) whether, and if so 
how, the Commission's calculation of the index level should incorporate 
recently resubmitted page 700 data for 2019. As discussed further 
below, the index level of PPI-FG-1.42% was calculated by trimming the 
data set to the middle 80%, using unadjusted ROE, and using pipelines' 
originally filed FERC Form No. 6, page 700 data for 2019. The economic 
effects of the NOPR proposal and various regulatory alternatives are 
shown in the Regulatory Impact Analysis.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ As discussed below, commenters must file any supporting 
workpapers in an acceptable spreadsheet format with all links and 
formulas intact. Infra P 35.

rulemaking can be found as a supporting document at

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Trimming of the Data Set

    8. As part of each five-year index review, the Commission trims the 
data set that it uses to establish the updated index level to remove 
outlying data. We propose to set the index level in this proceeding by 
trimming the data set to the middle 80% of all oil pipelines. While the 
Commission has used various data trimming approaches in the past,\23\ 
use of the middle 80% is consistent with the Commission's approach in 
the most recent 2020 index review.\24\ Although we considered different 
data trimming approaches for this five-year review, including using the 
middle 50% of the data set, we preliminarily conclude that the middle 
80% is the appropriate data set to use in this five-year review for the 
reasons discussed below.

middle 50%); 2010 Index Review, 133 FERC ] 61,228 at PP 60-63 (using 
the middle 50%); 2005 Index Review, 114 FERC ] 61,293 at P 28 
(considering average of the middle 50% and middle 80%); 2000 Remand 
Order, 102 FERC ] 61,295 at P 24 (same); Order No. 561-A, FERC 
Stats. & Regs. ] 31,000 at 31,096-97 (adopting Dr. Kahn's proposal 
to trim the data set to the middle 50%).
    \24\ 2020 Index Order, 173 FERC ] 61,245 at PP 25-32 (adopting 
the middle 80% for the 2021-2026 cycle). In the 2020 review, the 
Commission subsequently granted rehearing to modify the index to use 
the middle 50%, but the rehearing order was vacated on procedural 
grounds by the D.C. Circuit. See 2022 Rehearing Order, 178 FERC ] 
61,023 at PP 43-58, vacated sub nom. LEPA v. FERC, 109 F.4th at 547-
49; see also Revisions to Oil Pipeline Reguls. Pursuant to the 
Energy Pol'y Act of 1992, 188 FERC ] 61,173 (2024) (order 
reinstating index level based upon the middle 80% following 
vacatur).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9. First, as the Commission explained in the 2020 index review,\25\ 
it is appropriate to consider more data in measuring industry-wide cost 
changes rather than less. The Kahn Methodology determines the index 
level by calculating the central tendency of a statistically trimmed 
data sample. As a general matter, considering a larger data sample 
should enhance the calculation of the central tendency of industry cost 
experience.\26\ Furthermore, the middle 80% of the data set in this 
record excludes only 40 pipelines out of 196 pipelines in the full data 
set and only 6% of industry-wide barrel-miles, providing a robust 
sample of industry cost experience.\27\ By contrast, using the middle 
50% would exclude an additional 58 pipelines (for a total of 98 
pipelines excluded) and 12% of industry barrel-miles from the 
Commission's review of industry-wide cost changes over the 2019-2024 
period.\28\

the middle 80% would reduce the sample from 156 pipelines to 98 
pipelines).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 52905]]

    10. Second, we preliminarily find that ``normal'' cost changes are 
best defined using the inclusive data sample embodied in the middle 
80%. Prematurely discarding data prior to determining the central 
tendency could skew the index such that it does not reflect industry-
wide trends. By using the inclusive data sample in the middle 80%, the 
Commission is able to accurately identify the central tendency of 
industry-wide cost changes that reflects the ``normal'' cost changes 
recoverable by the index.\29\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ 2020 Index Order, 173 FERC ] 61,245 at P 27.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    11. Accordingly, we preliminarily conclude that the middle 80% is 
the appropriate data set to use in the upcoming five-year review cycle. 
However, we invite commenters to address whether the Commission should 
continue to trim the data set to the middle 80% or adopt an alternative 
approach to data trimming. Commenters should explain why their 
preferred approach is superior and how it would appropriately address 
outliers and spurious or unrepresentative data that could bias the 
index calculation in either direction.

B. Treatment of ROE in Data Set

    12. In May 2020, the Commission revised its methodology for 
determining ROE for oil pipelines. Whereas the Commission had 
previously relied solely on the discounted cash flow (DCF) model for 
determining ROE, the Commission now averages the results of the DCF and 
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) analyses (ROE Policy Change).\30\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ The DCF and CAPM models are described in the policy 
statement. See Inquiry Regarding the Comm'n's Pol'y for Determining 
Return on Equity, 171 FERC ] 61,155, at PP 18, 28, 50 (2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    13. We calculated the proposed index level without making any 
adjustment to the data in light of the ROE Policy Change. The 
Commission has never adjusted ROE in a prior index proceeding. We are 
concerned that adjusting the data in light of the ROE Policy Change 
would be a complex and difficult endeavor that would be inconsistent 
with indexing's purpose as a simplified and streamlined process.\31\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ In the 2020 Index Order, the Commission declined to adjust 
the ROE data due to the difficulty of determining just and 
reasonable alternative ROEs for the diverse pipelines in the data 
set. The Commission found that ``addressing such complex cost-of-
service issues would improperly complicate and prolong the five-year 
review process in violation of EPAct 1992's mandate for simplified 
and streamlined ratemaking.'' 2020 Index Order, 173 FERC ] 61,245 at 
PP 49-50.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    14. We encourage commenters to address whether, and if so, how, the 
Commission should address the ROE Policy Change in the index 
calculation. Commenters proposing any adjustment to the data set should 
explain why their proposal is consistent with EPAct 1992's dual 
mandates for just and reasonable rates and simplified and streamlined 
ratemaking. Among other things, to the extent pipelines changed their 
reported ROEs as a result of the ROE Policy Change, commenters should 
address how that data should be considered in light of indexing's 
relationship to recoverable costs under the Opinion No. 154-B 
methodology.\32\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \32\ We acknowledge that in the 2020 Index Order the Commission 
adjusted the data to remove the effects on the index level of a 
different policy change related to recovery of income tax costs. Id. 
PP 16-20. The Commission later found participants' challenges to 
this determination persuasive and modified the index level to use 
unadjusted data and to incorporate the effects of the policy change 
into the index. 2022 Rehearing Order, 178 FERC ] 61,023 at PP 17-36. 
However, the D.C. Circuit vacated the rehearing order on procedural 
grounds. LEPA v. FERC, 109 F.4th at 547-49. The Commission also 
proposed in a Supplemental NOPR to depart from the 2020 Index 
Order's holdings on that same income tax issue and to incorporate 
the policy change into the index. Supplemental Rev. of the Oil 
Pipeline Index Level, 89 FR 84475 (Oct. 23, 2024), 189 FERC ] 
61,030, at PP 24-34 (2024). For purposes of considering the ROE 
Policy Change and how it affects the index in this proceeding, we 
consider anew any issues related to whether the index should 
incorporate cost-of-service policy changes. Commenters should not 
simply rely upon statements and findings in the 2020 Index Order 
related to this matter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Resubmitted Form No. 6s

    15. We also observe that, since April 2025, 61 pipelines have 
resubmitted FERC Form No. 6 cost data for 2019 to change the 
calculation of the ROE as well as other modifications.\33\ We 
considered whether to use pipelines' resubmitted FERC Form No. 6 cost 
data for 2019 or whether to rely on pipelines' originally submitted 
FERC Form No. 6 cost data. For the reasons discussed below, the index 
level proposed in this NOPR relies on pipelines' originally submitted 
FERC Form No. 6 cost data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \33\ See Appendix (listing 61 pipelines that have resubmitted 
their 2020 Form No. 6 since April 2025 to change their page 700 data 
for 2019). See also Tallgrass Pony Express Pipeline, LLC, Form No. 6 
(filed June 13, 2025) (resubmitting 2019 Form No. 6 to change their 
page 700 data for 2019). Many of the changes involved changes to ROE 
and capital structure that led to modifications elsewhere on page 
700. However, some pipelines made additional changes to other cost 
components, such as rate base and operating expenses. See, e.g., 
Sunoco Pipeline L.P., Form No. 6, page 700 (filed Apr. 29, 2025) 
(among other modifications, showing an approximately $1 billion 
change to rate base); Tesoro High Plains Pipeline Company LLC, Form 
No. 6, page 700 (filed Apr. 17, 2025) (among other modifications, 
showing an approximately $7 million change to operating costs).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    16. First, the resubmissions were filed five years after the cost 
data was originally due to be submitted and include limited 
explanations for these changes.\34\ A similarly significant volume of 
late filings of Form No. 6 has not arisen in prior five-year review 
proceedings, and these filings raise potential concerns about use of 
the late-filed data. For example, the late-filed data from many 
pipelines filing Form No. 6 updates lack supporting calculations, 
instead merely stating that ``[t]he cost of service results have been 
updated to reflect the most current interpretation of the FERC 
methodology outlined in Opinion No. 154-B, 31 FERC 61,377 (1985), as 
modified and clarified by subsequent rulings.'' \35\ Additionally, we 
are concerned that use of updated data could introduce biases in the 
index calculations because only some pipelines updated their data. 
Accordingly, we are not including these late submittals in the 
calculation of the index level proposed in this NOPR.\36\ We seek 
comment on whether, and if so how, the Commission's calculation of the 
index level should incorporate the recently resubmitted page 700 data 
for 2019.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ See, e.g., Mid-America Pipeline Company, LLC, Form No. 6, 
page 700 (filed May 6, 2025) (stating ``The cost-of-service results 
have been updated to reflect the most current interpretation of the 
FERC methodology outlined in Opinion No. 154-B, 31 FERC 61,377 
(1985), as modified and clarified by Opinion No. 586.''); Platte 
Pipe Line Company, LLC, Form No. 6, page 700 (filed May 2, 2025) 
(stating ``2019 and 2020 data has been restated using a revised 
return on equity (ROE) calculation consistent with the ROE 
methodology approved by the Commission in Opinion No. 586.'').

III. Information Collection Statement

    17. The information collection requirements contained in this 
proposed rule are subject to review by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) under section 3507(d) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995.\37\ OMB's regulations require approval of certain information 
collection requirements imposed by agency rules.\38\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \37\ 44 U.S.C. 3507(d).
    \38\ 5 CFR 1320.11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    18. This proposed rule affects a currently approved information 
collection. Changes described in this proposed rule are non-substantive 
and do not change any filing requirements; rather this proposed rule 
adjusts an aspect of the calculation that is used in an annual tariff 
filing that FERC jurisdictional oil pipelines are required to submit to 
the Commission. This aspect of the calculation is reviewed and updated 
every five years.

[[Page 52906]]

Summary of Information Collection

    Title: FERC-550, Oil Pipeline Tariff Filings & Depreciation 
Studies.
    Action: Non-substantive change adjusting an aspect of the 
calculation that is used in annual oil pipeline tariff filings.
    OMB Control Nos.: 1902-0089 (FERC-550).
    Respondents: Oil Pipelines.
    Frequency of Information Collection: On occasion in compliance with 
requirements.
    Necessity of Information: The reforms in this proposed rule are 
necessary to ensure that the rates of oil pipelines are just and 
reasonable.
    Internal Review: The Commission has reviewed the reforms and 
determined that such reforms are necessary. These reforms conform to 
the Commission's need for efficient information collection, 
communication, and management within the energy industry. The 
Commission has specific, objective support for the burden estimates 
associated with the information collection requirements.
    Public Reporting Burden: The burden and cost related to filing an 
oil pipeline tariff will not change due to this proposed rule. The 
currently approved hourly burden for submitting a tariff filing is 7 
hours ($721 \39\).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \39\ The hourly cost used in this calculation is based on the 
estimated average annual cost per FERC FTE, including salary + 
benefits of $103 per hour, or $214,093 per year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and 
Executive Order 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review)

    19. Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as 
amended by Executive Orders 14215 (Ensuring Accountability for All 
Agencies) and supplemented by 13563 (Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review), directs agencies to assess the costs and benefits 
of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, 
to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits. Executive 
Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying costs and 
benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and promoting flexibility. 
The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has designated 
this proposed rule a ``significant regulatory action'' that is 
economically significant under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 
12866. Accordingly, OMB has reviewed this proposed rule. The regulatory 
impact analysis associated with this rulemaking can be found as a 
supporting document at <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a>. The following represents a 
summary of the aforementioned regulatory impact analysis.
    20. If adopted in a final rule, the index level proposed in this 
NOPR would influence rates for interstate oil pipeline transportation 
service, which would affect the interests of interstate oil pipelines 
and shippers on interstate oil pipelines.\40\ The RIA considers the 
potential impacts of the index level proposed in the NOPR relative to 
two baselines.\41\ The first baseline (Baseline 1) assumes that a final 
rule establishing a new index level for the 2026-2031 time period is 
not issued and assumes that the index level established for 2021-2025 
would remain effective for 2026-2031. The second baseline (Baseline 2) 
assumes that a final rule establishing an index level for the 2026-2031 
time period is not issued, and that there is no effective index level 
and pipelines are thus precluded from changing their rates pursuant to 
the Commission's indexing regulations for the 2026-2031 period. 
Adopting the index level proposed in this NOPR would reduce interstate 
oil pipeline transportation revenues during the five-year period that 
the index would be effective as compared to Baseline 1 and would 
increase oil pipeline revenues during the five-year period that the 
index would be effective as compared to Baseline 2.\42\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \40\ Approximately 350 pipelines file tariff rates with the 
Commission for interstate transportation of crude oil and petroleum 
products, and approximately 86% of rates are set under the indexing 
method. For more information about who is affected by the NOPR, see 
section II.C of the RIA.
    \41\ See RIA, section II.E.
    \42\ For more information about the effects of the NOPR as 
compared to Baseline 1 and Baseline 2, see RIA, section II.f. See 
also RIA, apps. A, B.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    21. As discussed in the RIA, the issuance of a final rule adopting 
the proposed index level in the NOPR would not create any measurable 
costs or benefits outside of these effects experienced by pipelines and 
shippers. While there are circumstances in which pipeline 
transportation rates can indirectly affect financial interests outside 
of pipelines and shippers (for example, lower pipeline transportation 
rates could affect commodity prices for refineries, prices of 
petroleum, or pipeline infrastructure investment), these impacts are 
sufficiently attenuated or otherwise so minimal as to not result in 
significant costs.\43\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \43\ See id. section II.G.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    22. The RIA also describes the regulatory alternatives that the 
Commission considered and the estimated effects of alternative index 
levels on annual interstate oil pipeline transportation revenues as 
compared to the baselines. The alternative index levels reflect 
different combinations of regulatory alternatives, specifically of 
different approaches to the three issues on which we seek comment in 
the NOPR.\44\ All of the index levels that result from the various 
regulatory alternatives considered in the RIA are higher compared to 
the index level proposed in the NOPR.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \44\ For further details about the regulatory alternatives 
considered by the Commission and their estimated effects on annual 
interstate oil pipeline transportation revenues, see RIA, section 
II.H, apps. A, B, C, D.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

V. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism)

    23. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) imposes certain requirements 
on Federal agencies formulating and implementing policies or 
regulations that preempt State law or that have federalism 
implications. The Executive Order requires agencies to examine the 
constitutional and statutory authority supporting any action that would 
limit the policymaking discretion of the States and to carefully assess 
the necessity for such actions.
    24. The Commission has examined the NOPR and has determined that it 
would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, the Commission has not prepared a federalism 
assessment.

VI. Executive Order 13211 (Actions Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use)

    25. Executive Order 13211 (Actions Concerning Regulations that 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use) requires 
Federal agencies to prepare and submit to OIRA at OMB, a Statement of 
Energy Effects for any significant energy action. A ``significant 
energy action'' is defined as any action that promulgates or is 
expected to lead to promulgation of a final rule, and that: (1) is a 
significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, or any 
successor order and is likely to have a significant adverse effect on 
the supply, distribution, or use of energy; or (2) is designated by the 
Administrator of OIRA as a significant energy action. For any 
significant energy action, the agency must give a detailed statement of 
any adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, or use should the 
proposal be implemented, and of reasonable alternatives to the

[[Page 52907]]

action and their expected benefits on energy supply, distribution, and 
use.
    26. At this NOPR stage, the Commission has preliminarily determined 
that this rule would not have a significant adverse effect on the 
supply, distribution, or use of energy. Accordingly, the Commission has 
not prepared a Statement of Energy Effects.

VII. Environmental Analysis

    27. The Commission is required to prepare an Environmental 
Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement for any action that may 
have a significant adverse effect on the human environment.\45\ The 
Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from this 
requirement as not having a significant effect on the human 
environment. Included in this exclusion are proposed rules that are 
clarifying, corrective, or procedural or that do not substantially 
change the effect of the regulations being amended.\46\ The action 
proposed herein falls within this categorical exclusion in the 
Commission's regulations.

(1987) (cross-referenced at 41 FERC ] 61,284).
    \46\ 18 CFR 380.4(a)(2)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

VIII. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    28. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) \47\ generally 
requires a description and analysis of proposed rules that will have 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
The Small Business Administration's (SBA) Office of Size Standards 
develops the numerical definition of a small business.\48\ The SBA 
defines a small oil pipeline company as one with less than 1,500 
employees.\49\ Based on this definition, the Commission identified 43 
small entities that the proposed rule will affect. As discussed above, 
the burdens and costs associated with filing oil pipeline tariffs will 
not change as a result of the proposed rule. The currently approved 
hourly burden for submitting a tariff filing is 7 hours ($721). We view 
this as a minimal economic impact for each entity. Accordingly, we 
certify that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Thus, no regulatory 
flexibility analysis is required.
