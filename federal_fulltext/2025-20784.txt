    The Commission strongly encourages electronic filing. Please file

status using the Commission's eFiling system at <a href="https://ferconline.ferc.gov/FERCOnline.aspx">https://ferconline.ferc.gov/FERCOnline.aspx</a>. For assistance, please contact 
FERC Online Support at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#df999a8d9c90b1b3b6b1ba8caaafafb0adab9fb9baadbcf1b8b0a9"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5e181b0c1d11303237303b0d2b2e2e312c2a1e383b2c3d70393128">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, (866) 208-3676 (toll 
free), or (202) 502-8659 (TTY). In lieu of electronic filing, you may 
submit a paper copy. Submissions sent via the U.S. Postal Service must 
be addressed to: Debbie Anne A. Reese, Secretary, Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street NE, Room 1A, Washington, DC 
20426. Submissions sent via any other carrier must be addressed to: 
Debbie-Anne A. Reese, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
12225 Wilkins Avenue, Rockville, MD 20852. All filings must clearly 
identify the project name and docket number on the first page: 
Minnewawa Hydroelectric Project (P-7887-019).
    The Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure require all 
intervenors filing documents with the Commission to serve a copy of 
that document on each person on the official service list for the 
project. Further, if an intervenor files comments or documents with the 
Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the 
responsibilities of a particular resource agency, they must also serve 
a copy of the document on that resource agency.
    k. The application has been accepted but is not ready for 
environmental analysis at this time.
    l. Project Description: The Minnewawa Project includes a 245-foot-
long, 63-foot-high reinforced mass concrete dam and spillway fitted 
with flashboards and an intake structure. The crest elevation of the 
dam is 1070.2 feet National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD 29) 
above the flashboards. The dam creates a 10-acre impoundment with a 
storage capacity of 155 acre-feet. From the impoundment, water flows 
into the intake structure and through a 5,717-foot-long partially 
buried steel penstock into a powerhouse containing a single 1,000-
kilowatt (kW) Francis turbine-generator unit. Water is then discharged 
back into Minnewawa Brook through a 790-foot-long tailrace. The project 
creates an approximately 2,900-foot bypassed reach of Minnewawa Brook, 
which extends from Minnewawa dam to the confluence of the tailrace with 
Minnewawa Brook. A 100-foot-long transmission line transmits power from 
the powerhouse to the grid. There are no project recreation facilities.
    The average annual generation of the project between 2003 through 
2023 was 3,945 megawatt-hours.
    Under a subsequent license, Ashuelot Hydro proposes to: (1) 
continue operating the project in an instantaneous run-of-river mode, 
such that flow in the Minnewawa Brook, as measured immediately 
downstream from the project tailrace, approximates the instantaneous 
sum of the inflow to the project impoundment, and releasing a minimum 
flow of 4 cubic feet per second into the bypassed reach, as measured 
immediately downstream from the Minnewawa Dam, or inflow to the 
impoundment, whichever is less; (2) install a new 75-kW fixed geometry 
turbine-generator unit in the existing powerhouse; and (3) install a 
tap and isolation valve to the existing penstock.
    m. A copy of the application is available for review on the 
Commission's website at <a href="https://www.ferc.gov">https://www.ferc.gov</a> using the ``eLibrary'' 
link. Enter the project's docket number excluding the last three digits
