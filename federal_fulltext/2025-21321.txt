Emergency Episodes and Ambient Air Quality Standards, into Ohio's State 
Implementation Plan (SIP). The amendments to the rule include minor

follow the online instructions for submitting comments. Once submitted, 
comments cannot be edited or removed from the docket. EPA may publish 
any comment received to its public docket. Do not submit electronically 
any information you consider to be Confidential Business Information 
(CBI), Proprietary Business Information (PBI), or other information 
whose disclosure is restricted by statute. Multimedia submissions 
(audio, video, etc.) must be accompanied by a written comment. The 
written comment is considered the official comment and should include 
discussion of all points you wish to make. EPA will generally not 
consider comments or comment contents located outside of the primary

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tyler Salamasick, Air and Radiation 
Division (AR-18J), Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West

<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89dae8e5e8e4e8fae0eae2a7ddf0e5ecfbc9ecf9e8a7eee6ff"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3c6f5d505d515d4f555f5712684550594e7c594c5d125b534a">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. The EPA Region 5 office is open from 8:30 
a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Final Rules section of this Federal 
Register, EPA is approving the State's SIP submittal as a direct final 
rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a 
noncontroversial submittal and anticipates no adverse comments. A 
detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final 
rule. If no relevant adverse comments are received in response to this 
rule, no further activity is contemplated. If EPA receives such 
comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public 
comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on 
this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period. Any 
parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this 
time. Please note that if EPA receives adverse comment on an amendment, 
paragraph, or section of this rule and if that provision may be severed 
from the remainder of the rule, EPA may adopt as final those provisions 
of the rule that are not the subject of an adverse comment. For 
additional information, see the direct final rule which is located in 
the Rules section of this Federal Register.

    Dated: November 14, 2025.
Cheryl Newton,
Acting Regional Administrator, Region 5.
