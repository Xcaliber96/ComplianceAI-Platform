SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    On February 15, 2012, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury 
Department) and the IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-
124791-11) in the Federal Register (77 FR 8753) under section 6109 of 
the Internal Revenue Code (Code) relating to the identifying number of 
tax return preparers (proposed regulations). The proposed regulations 
would have provided for two additional categories of tax return 
preparers eligible for a PTIN under a regulatory scheme in which the 
IRS sought to impose minimum qualification requirements on who could be 
a tax return preparer.
    Following publication of the proposed regulations, on February 11, 
2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit issued its opinion in Loving v. Internal Revenue Service, 742 
F.3d 1013 (D.C. Cir. 2014), which upheld an injunction against the IRS 
from regulating tax return preparers.

[[Page 54605]]

In light of Loving, the IRS is prohibited from regulating tax return 
preparers and, therefore, the Treasury Department and the IRS are 
withdrawing the proposed regulations.

Drafting Information

    The principal author of this notice is Mark Shurtliff of the Office 
of Associate Chief Counsel (Procedure and Administration). However, 
other personnel from the Treasury Department and the IRS participated 
in its development.

List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1
