relies.\3\ The Commission will continue to diligently enforce those 
regulations. Further, the Commission expects that regulated entities 
will continue to comply with all applicable existing duties of candor. 
The withdrawal of the NOPR and termination of this proceeding do not 
preclude the Commission from ensuring that information upon which it 
relies in exercising its statutory duties is truthful, accurate, and 
complete.
