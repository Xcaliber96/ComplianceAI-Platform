DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement

30 CFR Part 872

[Docket No. OSM-2025-0013 S1D1S SS08011000 SX064A000 256S180110; S2D2S 
SS08011000 SX064A000 25XS501520]

Prior Balance Replacement Funds

AGENCY: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Interior

ACTION: Direct final rule; request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This direct final rule revises the Federal regulations to 
rescind language identifying obsolete funds as part of the moneys that 
the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) must 
distribute to eligible States and Tribes each fiscal year. The existing 
regulations refer to prior balance replacement funds, which are moneys 
from the United States Treasury's General Fund that replaced State or 
Tribal share funds that were allocated before October 1, 2007, but 
never appropriated by Congress.

DATES: The final rule is effective January 23, 2026, unless significant 
adverse comments are received by December 24, 2025. If significant 
adverse comments are received, notice will be published in the Federal 
Register before the effective date either withdrawing the rule or 
issuing a new final rule that responds to significant adverse comments.

ADDRESSES: You may submit comments by one of the following methods:
    <bullet> Electronically: Go to the Federal eRulemaking Portal: 
<a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> and search for Docket Number OSM-2025-0013. 
Follow the instructions for submitting comments.
    <bullet> By hard copy: Submit by U.S. mail to Division of 
Regulatory Support, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and 
Enforcement, Department of the Interior, Attn: James Tyree, 1849 C 
Street NW, Mail Stop 4557, Washington, DC 20240.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Tyree, Chief, Division of 
Regulatory Support, (202) 208-4479, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#503a2429223535103f233d22357e373f26"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="96fce2efe4f3f3d6f9e5fbe4f3b8f1f9e0">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Individuals in 
the United States who are deaf, deafblind, hard of hearing, or have a 
speech disability may dial 711 (TTY, TDD, or TeleBraille) to access 
telecommunications relay services. Individuals outside the United 
States should use the relay services offered within their country to 
make international calls to the point-of-contact in the United States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 872.13 
outline the moneys that OSMRE must distribute to eligible States and 
Tribes each fiscal year. Existing 30 CFR 872.13(a)(5) refers to prior 
balance replacement funds, which are moneys from the United States 
Treasury's General Fund that replaced State or Tribal share funds that 
were allocated before October 1, 2007, but never appropriated by 
Congress. Section 411(h)(1) of the Surface Mining Control and 
Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) required OSMRE to distribute prior 
balance replacement funds to eligible

[[Page 52859]]

States and Tribes for seven years, beginning October 1, 2008. As the 
distribution of prior balance replacement funds is complete, the 
Department of the Interior (Department) and OSMRE have determined that 
existing 30 CFR 872.13(a)(5) should be rescinded because it is 
obsolete.
    The Department has determined that this reason, independently and 
alone, justifies rescission of existing 30 CFR 872.13(a)(5). The 
Department has no interest in maintaining a rule that is obsolete.
    The Department is issuing this rule as a direct final rule. 
Although the Administrative Procedure Act (APA, 5 U.S.C. 551-559) 
generally requires agencies to engage in notice and comment rulemaking, 
section 553 of the APA provides an exception when the agency ``for good 
cause finds'' that notice and comment are ``impracticable, unnecessary, 
or contrary to the public interest.'' Id. Sec.  553(b)(B). The 
Department has determined that notice and comment are unnecessary 
because this rule is noncontroversial; of a minor, technical nature; 
involves little agency discretion; and is unlikely to receive any 
significant adverse comments. Significant adverse comments are those 
that oppose the recission of the regulatory language and raise, alone 
or in combination, (1) reasons why the recission of the regulatory 
language is inappropriate, including challenges to the recission's 
underlying premise, or (2) serious unintended consequences of the 
recission. A comment recommending an addition to the rule will not be 
considered significant and adverse unless the comment explains how this 
direct final rule would be ineffective without the addition.

Procedural Determinations

Executive Order 12630--Governmental Actions and Interference With 
Constitutionally Protected Property Rights

    This rule does not result in a taking of private property or 
otherwise have regulatory takings implications under Executive Order 
12630. The rule rescinds an obsolete regulatory provision; therefore, 
the rule will not result in private property being taken for public use 
without just compensation. A takings implication assessment is not 
required.

Executive Order 12866--Regulatory Planning and Review and Executive 
Order 13563--Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review

    Executive Order 12866 provides that the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
will review all significant rules. OIRA has determined that this rule 
is not significant.
    Executive Order 13563 reaffirms the principles of Executive Order 
12866, while calling for improvements in the Nation's regulatory system 
to promote predictability, reduce uncertainty, and use the best, most 
innovative, and least burdensome tools for achieving regulatory ends. 
Executive Order 13563 directs agencies to consider regulatory 
approaches that reduce burdens and maintain flexibility and freedom of 
choice for the public where these approaches are relevant, feasible, 
and consistent with regulatory objectives. Executive Order 13563 
emphasizes further that agencies must base regulations on the best 
available science and that the rulemaking process must allow for public 
participation and an open exchange of ideas. The Department developed 
this rule in a manner consistent with these requirements.

Executive Order 12988--Civil Justice Reform

    This direct final rule complies with the requirements of Executive 
Order 12988. Among other things, this rule:
    (a) Meets the criteria of section 3(a) requiring that all 
regulations be reviewed to eliminate errors and ambiguity and be 
written to minimize litigation;
    (b) Meets the criteria of section 3(b)(2) requiring that all 
regulations be written in clear language and contain clear legal 
standards.

Executive Order 13132--Federalism

    Under the criteria of section 1 of Executive Order 13132, this rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the 
preparation of a federalism summary impact statement. This rule will 
not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship 
between the national government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. A 
federalism summary impact statement is not required.

Executive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments

    The Department of the Interior strives to strengthen its 
government-to-government relationship with Indian tribes through a 
commitment to consultation with Tribes and recognition of their right 
to self-governance and Tribal sovereignty. The Department evaluated 
this direct final rule under Executive Order 13175 and the Department's 
consultation policies and determined that it has no substantial direct 
effects on Federally recognized Indian tribes and that consultation 
under the Department's Tribal consultation policies is not required. 
The rule merely revises the Federal regulations to remove obsolete 
regulatory language.

Executive Order 13211--Actions Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use

    This direct final rule is not a significant energy action as 
defined in Executive Order 13211. Therefore, a Statement of Energy 
Effects is not required.

National Environmental Policy Act

    This direct final rule does not constitute a major Federal action 
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. A 
detailed statement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA, 
42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) is not required because this rule is covered by 
a categorical exclusion applicable to regulatory functions ``that are 
of an administrative, financial, legal, technical, or procedural 
nature.'' 43 CFR 46.210(i). In addition, the Department has determined 
that this rule does not involve any of the extraordinary circumstances 
listed in 43 CFR 46.215 that would require further analysis under NEPA.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    This rule does not impose any new information collection burden 
under the Paperwork Reduction Act. OMB previously approved the 
information collection activities contained in the existing regulations 
and assigned OMB control number 1029-0054. This rule does not impose an 
information collection burden because the Department is not making any 
changes to the information collection requirements.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA, 5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires an 
agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for all rules 
unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The RFA 
applies only to rules for which an agency is required to first publish 
a proposed rule. See 5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a). As the Department is 
not required to publish a notice of proposed

[[Page 52860]]

rulemaking for this direct final rule, the RFA does not apply.

Congressional Review Act

    This rule is not a major rule under the Congressional Review Act, 5 
U.S.C. 804(2). Specifically, the direct final rule: (a) will not have 
an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (b) will not 
cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual 
industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic 
regions; and (c) will not have significant adverse effects on 
competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on 
the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-
based enterprises in domestic and export markets.

Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

    This rule does not impose an unfunded mandate on State, local, or 
Tribal governments, or the private sector, of more than $100 million 
per year. The rule does not have a significant or unique effect on 
State, local, or Tribal governments, or the private sector. The rule 
merely revises the Federal regulations to remove an obsolete provision 
that is no longer used. Therefore, a statement containing the 
information required by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1531 
et seq.) is not required.
