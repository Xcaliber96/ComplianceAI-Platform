SUMMARY: Retirement Services, Office of Personnel Management (OPM)

forms: RI 25-15, Notice of Change in Student's Status and RI 25-14, 
Self-Certification of Full-Time School Attendance for the School Year. 
OPM is looking to combine the two forms into a single form under the

3206-0032.

DATES: Comments are encouraged and will be accepted until December 26,

particular information collection request by selecting ``Office of 
Personnel Management'' under ``Currently under Review--Open for Public 
Comments'' checkbox.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For specific questions related to this 
information collection activities, please contact: Retirement Services 
Publications Team, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW, 
Room 3316-BD, Washington, DC 20415, Attention: Cyrus S. Benson, or sent 
via electronic mail to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#550706052037393c3634213c3a3b2601303438153a25387b323a23"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="df8d8c8faabdb3b6bcbeabb6b0b1ac8bbabeb29fb0afb2f1b8b0a9">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Office of Personnel Management, in 
accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 
3506(c)(2)(A)), provides the public with an opportunity to comment on 
proposed, revised, and continuing collections of information. This 
helps the Agency assess the impact of its information collection 
requirements and minimize the public's reporting burden. It also helps 
the public understand the Agency's information collection requirements 
and provide the requested data in the desired format. The information 
collections (OMB Control Nos. 3206-0042 and 3206-0032) were previously 
published in the Federal Register on June 2, 2025, at 90 FR 23384 and 
August 17, 2023, at 88 FR 56056, allowing for a 60-day public comment 
period, respectively. No comments were received for either collection. 
OPM is looking to combine the two forms into a single form. We are 
renewing ICR 3206-0042, and 3206-0032 has expired. OPM is requesting to 
discontinue 3206-0032 and to collect that information under the ICR 
3206-0042.
    The purpose of this notice is to notify the public that OPM is 
submitting the information collection to the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) for review and to allow an additional 30 days for public 
comments. OPM is soliciting comments on the proposed information 
collection request (ICR) that is described below. Please note that 
written comments received in response to this notice will be considered 
public records.
    RI 25-14 and RI 25-15 forms are very similar in terms of the 
information collected from students. Nonetheless, the forms were 
historically managed under two different information collections. OPM 
is currently planning to consolidate the forms into a single form. The 
information collection for form RI 25-14 (OMB Control number 3206-0032) 
is currently expired with an estimated public burden of 353 hours for 
1,764 responses. The information collection for form RI 25-15 (OMB 
Control number 3206-0042) is expiring at the end of November with an 
estimated public burden of 835 hours for 2,500 responses. As OPM is 
proposing to combine these information collections, the estimated 
public burden for the revised information collection is 1,188 hours for 
4,264 responses.
    We invite comments that:
    1. Evaluate the utility of the changes made to the forms;
    2. Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    3. Suggest ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and
    4. Suggest ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on those who are to respond, including using appropriate 
automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting 
electronic submissions of responses.
