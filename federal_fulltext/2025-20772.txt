SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In compliance with 44 U.S.C. 3507, FDA has

Third-Party Review Program

OMB Control Number 0910-0375--Extension

    Section 523 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) 
(21 U.S.C. 360m), directs FDA to accredit persons in the private sector 
to review certain premarket notifications (510(k)s; see 21 U.S.C. 
360(k)). Participation in the 510(k) third party (3P510k) review 
program by accredited persons is entirely voluntary. A third party 
wishing to participate will submit a

[[Page 52972]]

request for accreditation to FDA. Accredited third-party reviewers have 
the ability to review a manufacturer's 510(k) submission for selected 
devices. After reviewing a submission, the reviewer will forward a copy 
of the 510(k) submission, along with the reviewer's documented review 
and recommendation, to FDA. Third-party reviewers should maintain 
records of their 510(k) reviews and a copy of the 510(k) for a 
reasonable period of time, usually 3 years. The 3P510k review program 
is intended to allow review of devices by third-party 510k review 
organizations (3PROs) to provide manufacturers of these devices an 
alternative review process that allows FDA to best utilize our 
resources on higher risk devices.
    Respondents to this information collection are businesses or 
government and can be for-profit or not-for-profit organizations, such 
as third party review organizations.
    The guidance ``510(k) Third-Party Review Program, Guidance for 
Industry, Food and Drug Administration Staff and Third Party Review 
Organizations'' (March 2020) was intended to provide a comprehensive 
look into FDA's current thinking regarding the 3P510k program and third 
party review of Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) requests by 
describing FDA's expectations for the review of 510(k) submissions and 
EUA requests by third party review organizations. This guidance 
document also reflects section 523 of the FD&C Act, which directs FDA 
to issue guidance on the factors that will be used in determining 
whether a class I or class II device type, or subset of such device 
types, is eligible for review by an accredited person. This guidance 
was superseded on November 21, 2024, when FDA issued the final guidance 
``510(k) Third Party Review Program and Third Party Emergency Use 
Authorization (EUA) Review; Guidance for Industry, Food and Drug 
Administration Staff, and Third Party Review Organizations'' (November 
2024) (available at <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/510k-third-party-review-program-and-third-party-emergency-use-authorization-eua-review">https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/510k-third-party-review-program-and-third-party-emergency-use-authorization-eua-review</a>). The guidance also includes new 
content that outlines how FDA may contract with third party review 
organizations to perform reviews of EUA requests (3PEUA review) when 
appropriate emergency declaration authorities are active under section 
564 of the FD&C Act. (See OMB Control Number 0910-0595.)
    In the Federal Register of July 3, 2025 (90 FR 29552), FDA 
published a 60-day notice requesting public comment on the proposed 
collection of information. No comments were received.
    FDA estimates the burden of this collection of information as 
follows:

    Upon review of this information collection, we have adjusted our 
burden estimate for the average burden hours required per response for 
initial requests for accreditation from 24 to 40 hours to more 
accurately reflect the time required based on recent experience of FDA 
program staff. This adjustment has resulted in an increase of 15 hours 
to the currently approved burden.

Acting, Deputy Commissioner for Policy, Legislation, and International 
Affairs.
