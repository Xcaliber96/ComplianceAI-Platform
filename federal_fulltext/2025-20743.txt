SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 
Clauses 852.237-70, Indemnification and Medical Liability Insurance; 
852.228-71, Indemnification and Insurance.
    OMB Control Number: 2900-0590. <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRASearch">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRASearch</a>.
    Type of Review: Reinstatement without change of a previously 
approved collection.
    Abstract: VAAR clause 852.237-70, Indemnification and Medical 
Liability Insurance, is used in lieu of Federal Acquisition Regulation 
(FAR) clause 52.237-7, Indemnification and Medical Liability Insurance, 
in solicitations and contracts for the acquisition of nonpersonal 
health care services. It requires the apparent successful bidder/
offeror, upon the request of the contracting officer, prior to contract 
award, to furnish evidence of insurability of the offeror and/or all 
health-care providers who will perform under the contract. In addition, 
the clause requires the contractor, prior to commencement of services 
under the contract, to provide Certificates of Insurance or insurance 
policies evidencing that the firm possesses the types and amounts of 
insurance required by the solicitation. The information is required in 
order to protect VA by ensuring that the firm to which award may be 
made and the individuals who may provide health care services under the 
contract are insurable and that, following award, the contractor and 
its employees will continue to possess the types and amounts of 
insurance required by the solicitation. It helps ensure that VA will 
not be held liable for any negligent acts of the contractor or its 
employees and ensures that VA and VA beneficiaries are protected by 
adequate insurance coverage.
    VAAR clause 852.228-71, Indemnification and Insurance, is used in 
solicitations for vehicle or aircraft services. It requires the 
apparent successful bidder/offeror, prior to contract award, to furnish 
evidence that the firm possesses the types and amounts of insurance 
required by the solicitation. This evidence is in the form of a 
certificate from the firm's insurance company. The information is 
required to protect VA by ensuring that the firm to which award will be 
made possesses the types and amounts of insurance required by the 
solicitation. It helps ensure that VA will not be held liable for any 
negligent acts of the contractor and ensures that VA beneficiaries and 
the public are protected by adequate insurance coverage.
    VA uses the information to determine whether additional contract 
terms and conditions are necessary. An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
