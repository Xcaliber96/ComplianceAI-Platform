33 CFR Part 165

[Docket Number USCG-2025-0082]
RIN 1625-AA00


Safety Zones; Recurring Events in Captain of the Port Duluth Zone

AGENCY: Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is revising existing regulations for recurring 
safety zones in the Captain of the Port Duluth Zone. These amendments 
update the table of annually recurring marine events, add definitions, 
and clarify how and when the COTP may enforce listed zones. These 
changes will improve the timeliness and clarity of public notification, 
enhance mariner situational awareness, and promote the safety of life 
on the navigable waters of western Lake Superior during recurring near-
shore events.

DATES: This rule is effective December 26, 2025.

NPRM Notice of proposed rulemaking
Sec.  Section
U.S.C. United States Code

II. Background and Authority

    Each year, communities throughout the western Lake Superior region 
sponsor marine events that generate predictable concentrations of 
spectator vessels in confined harbor and near-shore waters. These 
activities pose recurring hazards, including the accidental discharge 
of fireworks, falling embers or debris, and congestion of swimmers or 
boaters. In such conditions, even routine vessel wakes or sudden wind 
shifts can increase the risk of collisions and injuries.
    To address these risks, the Coast Guard previously codified 
annually recurring safety zones for these events in 33 CFR 165.943. 
Under the current regulation, enforcement of each zone must be 
individually noticed, which can result in fragmented or delayed 
information reaching mariners. This fragmentation may lead to confusion 
when multiple events occur in close proximity or on separate dates.
    On September 9, 2025, the Coast Guard published a notice of 
proposed rulemaking (NPRM) titled Safety Zones; Recurring Events in 
Captain of the Port Duluth Zone (90 FR 43404). In that NPRM, we stated 
why we issued the NPRM and invited comments on our proposed regulatory 
action related to regulation revision.
    Under the authority in 46 U.S.C. 70034, the COTP has determined 
that this rule revision is necessary to improve clarity, consistency, 
and public communication for the purposes of protecting personnel, 
vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated 
with these recurring marine events. The revised rule defines key terms 
to support uniform enforcement; clarifies procedures for

[[Page 53219]]

enforcement and early suspension of safety zones; updates the 
regulation's structure and formatting; and frames the rule to allow 
flexibility for consolidated Notifications of Enforcement when 
operationally appropriate. These revisions will enhance the 
predictability and timeliness of safety communications, thereby 
improving mariner situational awareness and promoting the safety of 
life on navigable waters.

III. Discussion of Comments and the Rule

    During the comment period that ended on October 9, 2025, we 
received no comments. Based on further internal review, we made minor 
technical changes to Table 1 for clarity. There are no substantive 
changes in the regulatory text of this rule from the proposed rule in 
the NPRM.
    This revision to the existing regulatory text and associated table 
establishing annually recurring safety zones within the Captain of the 
Port (COTP) Duluth Zone, as listed in 33 CFR 165.943, updates event 
listings, clarifies enforcement procedures, adds relevant definitions, 
and structures the rule in a way that may accommodate a single 
Notification of Enforcement announcing multiple zones or event dates. 
These revisions will improve the clarity, consistency, and timeliness 
of public notification.
    The geographic locations and general durations of the safety zones 
remain unchanged. Each safety zone will continue to be enforced only 
during specific periods, which will be announced in advance through 
publication of a Notification of Enforcement in the Federal Register 
and via Broadcast Notices to Mariners over VHF-FM marine channel 16. 
These measures ensure continued protection of persons, vessels, and the 
navigable waters of western Lake Superior during recurring safety zone 
enforcement periods. During periods of enforcement, no vessel or person 
may enter a designated safety zone without obtaining permission from 
the COTP Duluth or their designated representative.

IV. Regulatory Analyses

    We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and 
Executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses 
based on a number of these statutes and Executive orders.

A. Impact on Small Entities

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612, as 
amended, requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of 
regulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term ``small 
entities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations 
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their 
fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 
50,000. Section 605 of the RFA allows an agency to certify a rule, in 
lieu of preparing an analysis, if the rulemaking is not expected to 
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities.
    The Coast Guard certifies that, although some small entities may 
intend to transit the safety zone above, this rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, 
as mandated by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612 
for the following reasons. Vessel traffic will be able to safely 
transit around these safety zones, which are short in duration, 
geographically limited, and often occur during off-peak periods when 
vessel traffic is normally low. In addition, the Coast Guard will issue 
a Broadcast Notice to Marines via VHF FM marine channel 16, which will 
allow small entities to adjust their transit plans, and the rule allows 
vessels to request permission to enter the zone from the COTP.
    Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), if this rule will affect your 
small business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have 
questions, contact the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION 
CONTACT section.
    Small businesses may send comments to the Small Business and 
Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small 
Business Regulatory Fairness Boards by calling 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-
734-3247).

B. Collection of Information

    This rule will not call for a new collection of information under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).

C. Federalism and Indian Tribal Governments

    We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, 
and have determined that it is consistent with the fundamental 
federalism principles and preemption requirements described in that 
Order.
    Also, this rule does not have tribal implications under Executive 
Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on 
one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal 
Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.

D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

    As required by The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1531-1538), the Coast Guard certifies that this rule will not result in 
an annual expenditure of $100,000,000 or more (adjusted for inflation) 
by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector.

E. Environment

    We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security 
Directive 023-01, Rev. 1, associated implementing instructions, and 
Environmental Planning COMDTINST 5090.1 (series), which guide the Coast 
Guard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have determined that this action is one of 
a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a 
significant effect on the human environment.
    This rule is a revision of an existing regulation establishing 
recurring safety zones in the Captain of the Port Duluth Zone. It is 
categorically excluded from further review under paragraph L60(a) of 
Appendix A, Table 1 of DHS Instruction Manual 023-01-001-01, Rev. 1. A 
Record of Environmental Consideration supporting this determination is 
available in the docket.

Duluth Zone.

    (a) Regulations. (1) In accordance with the general regulations in 
Sec.  165.23 of this part, entry into, transiting, or anchoring within 
this safety zone is

[[Page 53220]]

prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Duluth 
or his or her designated on-scene representative.
    (2) These safety zones are closed to all vessel traffic, except as 
may be permitted by the COTP Duluth or his or her designated on-scene 
representative.
    (3) The ``on-scene representative'' of the COTP Duluth is any Coast 
Guard commissioned, warrant or petty officer who has been designated by 
the COTP Duluth to act on his behalf.
    (4) Vessel operators desiring to enter or operate within the safety 
zone must contact the COTP Duluth or his or her on-scene representative 
to obtain permission to do so. The COTP Duluth or his or her on-scene 
representative may be contacted via VHF Channel 16. Vessel operators 
given permission to enter or operate in the safety zone must comply 
with all directions given to them by the COTP Duluth, or his or her on-
scene representative.
    (5) The enforcement dates and times for each of the safety zones 
listed in Table 1 are subject to change, but the duration of 
enforcement would remain the same or nearly the same as stated in Table 
1. In the event of a change, the COTP Duluth will provide notice to the 
public by publishing a Notification of Enforcement in the Federal 
Register, as well as issuing a Broadcast Notice to Mariners.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section:
    (1) Designated representative means any Coast Guard coxswain, petty 
officer, or other officer operating a Coast Guard vessel and a Federal, 
State, and local officer designated by or assisting the COTP Duluth in 
the enforcement of each safety zone.
    (2) Public vessel means a vessel that is owned, chartered, or 
operated by the United States, or by a State or political subdivision 
thereof.
    (3) Rain date refers to an alternate date and/or time in which the 
safety zone would be enforced in the event of inclement weather.
    (c) Suspension of enforcement. The COTP Duluth may suspend 
enforcement of any of these zones earlier than listed in this section. 
Should the COTP Duluth suspend any of these zones earlier than the 
listed duration in this section, he or she may make the public aware of 
this suspension by Broadcast Notice to Mariners and/or on-scene notice 
by his or her designated representative.
    (d) Exemption. Public vessels, as defined in paragraph (b) of this 
section, are exempt from the requirements in this section.
    (e) Waiver. For any vessel, the COTP Duluth or his or her 
designated representative may waive any of the requirements of this 
section upon finding that operational conditions or other circumstances 
are such that application of this section is unnecessary or impractical 
for the purposes of safety or security.
    (f) Notification. The enforcement dates and times for each of the 
listed safety zones are subject to change. Advance notice to the local 
maritime community will be made well in advance of the events through 
Notification(s) of Enforcement in the Federal Register, listing exact 
times and dates of the enforcement periods. A Broadcast Notice to 
Mariners will also be issued.
