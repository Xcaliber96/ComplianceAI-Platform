SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[OMB Control No. 3235-0771]


Agency Information Collection Activities; Proposed Collection; 
Comment Request; Extension: Rule 3a71-3(d)

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC or ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
proposed collection of information.
    Rule 3a71-3 under the Exchange Act provides in part that, for 
purposes of determining whether they can avail themselves of the de 
minimis exception to the ``security-based swap dealer'' definition, 
non-U.S. persons must count certain dealing transactions with non-U.S. 
counterparties that have been ``arranged, negotiated, or executed'' by 
personnel in the United States. Rule 3a71-3(d) provides an exception 
from that ``arranged, negotiated, or executed'' counting requirement. 
The information collection is required to obtain or retain a benefit 
and the information is used by the Commission to monitor compliance 
with the exception to provisions of Exchange Act Rule 3a71-3 that 
otherwise would require non-U.S. persons to count--against the 
thresholds associated with the de minimis exception to the ``security-
based swap dealer'' definition--security-based swap dealing 
transactions with non-U.S. counterparties when U.S. personnel arrange, 
negotiate, or execute those transactions.
    The Commission continues to estimate that up to 24 entities may 
seek to rely on the exception to the de minimis counting requirement of 
Rule 3a71-3. In connection with the conditions to the exception, each 
of those up to 24 entities would make use of an affiliated registered 
security-based swap dealer or registered broker. In general, the 
registered entity would be required to comply with the collections of 
information. Applications for ``listed jurisdiction'' status may be 
submitted by the up to 24 relying entities, but the staff believes that 
the greater portion of such applications will be submitted by foreign 
financial authorities.
    The Commission continues to estimate that the aggregate yearly 
reporting burden for Rule 3a71-3(d), for all respondents, is 
approximately 235,242.44 hours per year. In addition, to account for 
inflation, the Commission estimates that the aggregate annual cost for 
all of Rule 3a71-3(d) for all respondents is approximately 
$1,359,778.96 per year. A detailed break-down of the burdens applicable 
to each type of entity is provided in the supporting statement.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB Control Number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the SEC, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the SEC's estimate of the burden 
imposed by the proposed collection of information, including the 
validity of the methodology and the assumptions used; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated, 
electronic collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology.
    Please direct your written comments on this 60-Day Collection 
Notice to Austin Gerig, Director/Chief Data Officer, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, c/o Tanya Ruttenberg via email to 
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#92c2f3e2f7e0e5fde0f9c0f7f6e7f1e6fbfdfcd3f1e6d2e1f7f1bcf5fde4"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4c1c2d3c293e3b233e271e2928392f382523220d2f380c3f292f622b233a">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> by February 2, 2026. There will be a 
second opportunity to comment on this SEC request following the Federal 
Register publishing a 30-Day Submission Notice.

    Dated: November 28, 2025.
Stephanie Fouse,
Assistant Secretary.
