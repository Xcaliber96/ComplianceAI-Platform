    Title: Timely Mailing Treated as Timely Filing.
    OMB Control Number: 1545-1899.
    Regulation Project Number: TD 9543 and Revenue Procedure 97-19.
    Abstract: This information collection contains regulations that 
provide guidance as to the only ways to establish prima facie evidence 
of delivery of documents that have a filing deadline prescribed by the 
internal revenue laws, absent direct proof of actual delivery. The 
regulations are necessary to provide greater certainty on this issue 
and to provide specific guidance. The regulations affect taxpayers who 
mail Federal tax documents to the Internal Revenue Service or the 
United States Tax Court. Revenue Procedure 97-19 provides the criteria 
that will be used by the IRS to determine whether a private delivery 
service qualifies as a designated Private Delivery Service under 
section 7502 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    Current Actions: There is no change to the existing collection 
previously approved by OMB.
    Type of Review: Extension of a currently approved collection.
    Affected Public: Individuals or households, business or other for-
profit organizations, not-for-profit institutions, farms, federal 
government, and state, local, or tribal government.
    The estimated burden related to Revenue Procedure 97-19:
    Estimated Number of Responses: 14.
    Estimated Time per Response: 60 hours, 54 minutes.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 853.
    The estimated burden related to TD 9543:
    Estimated Number of Responses: 10,847,647.
    Estimated Time per Response: 6 minutes.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 1,084,765.
    Total Estimated Number of Responses: 10,847,661.
