II. Legal Basis

    FMCSA has authority under 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b) to grant 
exemptions from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. FMCSA 
must publish a notice of each exemption request in the Federal Register 
(49 CFR 381.315(a)). The Agency must provide the public an opportunity 
to inspect the information relevant to the application, including the 
applicant's safety analysis. The Agency must provide an opportunity for 
public comment on the request.
    The Agency reviews the application, safety analyses, and public 
comments submitted and determines whether granting the exemption would 
likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the 
level that would be achieved absent such exemption, pursuant to the 
standard set forth in 49 U.S.C. 31315(b)(1). The Agency must publish 
its decision in the Federal Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, 
the notice will identify the regulatory provision from which the 
applicant will be exempt, the effective period, and all terms and 
conditions of the exemption (49 CFR 381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption is 
denied, the notice will explain the reason for the denial (49 CFR 
381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may be renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)).

III. Applicant's Request

Current Regulatory Requirements

    Under 49 CFR 383.25(a)(1), a CLP holder, when operating a CMV, must 
be accompanied by a CDL holder with the proper CDL class and 
endorsements necessary to operate the CMV. The CDL holder must be 
physically present in the front seat of the CMV next to the CLP holder 
at all times.

Applicant's Request

    Agri-Tech Aviation states that it serves farmers in Iowa with 
aerial application needs. The organization has been in business since 
1987 and operates with a fleet of five CMVs; two straight trucks that 
hold 500 gallons of jet fuel for dry operations, and three Ford F550 
flatbed trucks with a 30-foot gooseneck capable of carrying up to 900 
gallons of jet fuel and 1350 gallons of crop protection products, most 
of which fall under Class 9 (miscellaneous hazardous materials) and do 
not require placarding. The applicant states that it operates only in 
Iowa. Its drivers operate within a 150-air mile radius from their home 
base, departing before sunrise and returning before sunset. The 
applicant operates with team drivers for 2-3 hours a day, usually 
during light traffic. The applicant describes its employees as seasonal 
staff who are college students and individuals over the age 18.
    The applicant stated that the brief operational season for aerial 
applications makes it ``nearly impossible to recruit qualified 
drivers.'' According to the applicant, as a seasonal business, it takes 
more than a full season for a potential driver to fulfill the 
requirements for a Class A CDL with combination and hazmat 
endorsements. The applicant stated it's ``full request'' is an 
exemption from the requirement in 49 CFR 383.25(a)(1), for ``drivers to 
be able to drive our vehicles with commercial learner's permit holders 
who have passed the commercial driver's license (CDL) skills test but 
have not obtained the CDL document from their State of domicile to 
drive a commercial motor vehicle without having a CDL holder seated in 
the passenger seat.'' FMCSA understand this to be a request about 
current CLP holders, so that drivers with CLPs working for the 
applicant can drive the applicant's CMVs without a CDL holder seated in 
the front seat of the CMV. If granted, this exemption would apply to 
six drivers.
    Additionally, because its operation is seasonal and ``serves 
farmers directly with critical service to protect their farms,'' the 
applicant also requests that

[[Page 53051]]

its CMVs be included in the definition of a ``covered farm vehicle,'' 
as defined in 49 CFR 390.5. The applicant states that this ``will 
require these drivers to stay within 150 air miles and will only be 
allowed to drive in the state of Iowa.'' Under 49 CFR 390.39, ``covered 
farm vehicles'' are exempt from all requirements in 49 parts 382, 383, 
391 (subpart E), 395, and 396. As defined in 49 CFR 390.5, ``covered 
farm vehicles'' with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR), gross 
combination weight rating (GCWR), or gross vehicle weight (GVW) or 
gross combination weight (GCW), whichever is greater, of more than 
26,001 pounds may use the exemptions in 49 CFR 390.39 within the State 
of registration and across State lines within 150 air miles of the farm 
or ranch with respect to which the vehicle is being operated, while 
vehicles with a GVWR, GCWR, GVW, or GCW of 26,001 pounds or less may 
use the exemptions anywhere in the United States. Based on this 
request, FMCSA attempted to clarify whether Applicant was seeking 
exemptions from all of parts 382, 383, 391 (subpart E), 395, and 396, 
but was unable to verify the provisions the applicant sought an 
exemption from. Under 49 CFR 390.39(a)(1), drivers of ``covered farm 
vehicles'' are exempt from the CDL requirements. Agri-Tech Aviation's 
request to have FMCSA classify its trucks as ``covered farm vehicles'' 
is therefore incompatible with its request for an exemption from the 
CDL requirement of 49 CFR 383.25(a)(1). Because the applicant's ``full 
request'' did not specifically seek an exemption other than from 49 CFR 
383.25(a)(1), FMCSA is not seeking comment on the portion of the 
applicant's request pertaining to the definition of ``covered farm 
vehicles.''
    A copy of Agri-Tech Aviation's application for exemption is 
available for review in the docket for this notice.

IV. Request for Comments

    In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31315(b), FMCSA requests public 
comment from all interested persons on Agri-Tech Aviation's application 
for an exemption from the requirement that a CLP holder be accompanied 
by a CDL holder, seated in the front seat, while the CMV is being 
driven by the CLP holder.
    All comments received before the close of business on the comment 
closing date will be considered and will be available for examination 
in the docket at the location listed under the Addresses section of 
this notice. Comments received after the comment closing date will be 
filed in the public docket and will be considered to the extent 
practicable. In addition to late comments, FMCSA will also continue to 
file, in the public docket, relevant information that becomes available 
after the comment closing date. Interested persons should continue to 
examine the public docket for new material.

Associate Administrator for Policy.
