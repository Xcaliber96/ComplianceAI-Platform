SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520, and its 
implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, require Federal agencies to 
issue two notices seeking public comment on information collection 
activities before OMB may approve paperwork packages. See 44 U.S.C. 
3506, 3507; 5 CFR 1320.8 through 1320.12. On August 8, 2025, FRA 
published a 60-day notice in the Federal Register soliciting public 
comment on the ICR for which it is now seeking OMB approval. See 90 FR 
38587. FRA has received no comments related to the proposed collection 
of information.
    Before OMB decides whether to approve this proposed collection of 
information, it must provide 30 days' notice for public comment. 
Federal law requires OMB to approve or disapprove paperwork packages 
between 30 and 60 days after the 30-day notice is published. 44 U.S.C. 
3507(b) and (c); 5 CFR 1320.12(d); see also 60 FR 44978, 44983 (Aug. 
29, 1995). The 30-day notice informs the regulated community of their 
opportunity to file relevant comments and affords the agency adequate 
time to consider public comments before it renders a decision. 60 FR 
44983 (Aug. 29, 1995). Therefore, respondents should submit their 
respective comments to OMB within 30 days of publication to best ensure 
having their full effect.
    Comments are invited on the following ICR regarding: (1) whether 
the information collection activities are necessary for FRA to properly 
execute its functions, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (2) the accuracy of FRA's estimates of the burden of 
the information collection activities, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used to determine the estimates; (3) ways 
for FRA to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
being collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of information 
collection activities on the public, including the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology.
    The summary below describes the ICR that FRA will submit for OMB 
clearance as the PRA requires:
    Title: Use of Locomotive Horns at Highway-Rail Grade Crossings.
    OMB Control Number: 2130-0560.
    Abstract: FRA's locomotive horn use regulations (49 CFR part 222) 
prescribe standards for sounding locomotive horns when locomotives 
approach and pass through public highway-rail grade crossings. FRA 
collects information from railroads and public authorities to increase 
safety at public highway-rail grade crossings nationwide by requiring 
that locomotive horns be sounded when trains approach and pass through 
these crossings or by ensuring that a safety level, at least equivalent 
to that provided by routine locomotive horn sounding, exists for quiet 
zone corridors in which such routine horn sounding is silenced. FRA 
reviews applications by public authorities intending to establish new 
quiet zones by implementing alternative safety measures and approves 
the effectiveness rate assigned to them.
    Type of Request: Revision of a currently approved collection.
    Affected Public: Businesses.
    Form(s): N/A.
    Respondent Universe: 754 railroads/645 public authorities.
    Frequency of Submission: On occasion.
    Total Estimated Annual Responses: 3,536.
    Total Estimated Annual Burden: 7,232 hours.
    Total Estimated Annual Burden Hour Dollar Cost Equivalent: 
$534,508.57.
    FRA informs all interested parties that it may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a respondent is not required to respond to, a collection 
of information that does not display a currently valid OMB control 
number.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520.)
