OPM assess the impact of its information collection requirements and 
minimize the public's reporting burden. It also helps the public 
understand OPM's information collection requirements and provide the 
requested data in the desired format. OPM is soliciting comments on the 
expiring information collection request (ICR) that is described below. 
OPM is especially interested in public comments that:
    1. Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of functions of the agency, 
including whether the information will have practical utility;
    2. Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    3. Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and
    4. Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those 
who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, 
electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic 
submissions of responses.
    Please note that written comments received in response to this 
notice will be considered public records.
    RI 20-123 is used by retirees who have retired under disability 
annuity provisions and who have performed service as law enforcement 
officers, firefighters, nuclear materials couriers, air traffic 
controllers, Congressional employees, Members of Congress, Capitol and 
Supreme Court police, or custom and border protection officers (and 
their survivors or beneficiaries) to request that Retirement Operations 
review the computations of the retiree's disability annuity. Upon 
receipt of this form, OPM will ensure it has computed the disability 
annuity in accordance with applicable statutes. These provisions 
require OPM to compute the disability annuities of affected retirees 
using the higher annuity amount computed under the disability annuity 
computation provisions or the enhanced immediate retirement computation 
provisions specifically applicable to these special employee 
populations. When OPM receives form RI 20-123 from an annuitant, 
survivor, or beneficiary, it will take action to review the retiree's 
annuity computation and, if the retiree is entitled to an increased 
benefit, or if a survivor or beneficiary is entitled to amounts accrued 
but unpaid to a deceased retiree, OPM will process accordingly.
