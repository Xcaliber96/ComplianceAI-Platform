SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. What information is EPA particularly interested in?

    Pursuant to PRA section 3506(c)(2)(A) (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)), 
EPA specifically solicits comments and information to enable it to:
    1. Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Agency, 
including whether the information will have practical utility.
    2. Evaluate the accuracy of the Agency's estimates of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used.
    3. Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected.
    4. Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those 
who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated 
electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology (e.g., permitting electronic 
submission of responses). In particular, EPA is requesting comments 
from very small businesses (those that employ less than 25 employees) 
on examples of specific additional efforts that EPA could make to 
reduce the paperwork burden for very small businesses affected by this 
collection.

II. What information collection activity or ICR does this action apply 
to?

    Title: Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazards Disclosure 
Requirements.
    EPA ICR No.: 1710.10.
    OMB Control No.: 2070-0151.
    ICR Status: This ICR is currently approved through August 31, 2026. 
Under the PRA, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is 
not required to respond to, a collection of information, unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control numbers 
for EPA's regulations in title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR), after appearing in the Federal Register when approved, are 
displayed either by publication in the Federal Register or by other 
appropriate means, such as on the related collection instrument or 
form, if applicable. The display of OMB control numbers for certain EPA 
regulations is consolidated in 40 CFR part 9.
    Abstract: This ICR will cover the information collection activities 
associated with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements for 
sellers, lessors, and their agents' disclosure activities in target 
housing including the allowance of up to ten days for an optional risk 
assessment or inspection before being obligated under purchase or lease 
contract.
    The ICR, which is available in the docket along with other related 
materials, provides a detailed explanation of the collection activities 
and the burden estimate that is only briefly summarized here:
    Form number(s): 9600-040 and 9600-041.
    Respondents/affected entities: Entities potentially affected by 
this ICR include North American Industrial Classification System 
(NAICS) Codes 5311 Lessors of real estate and 5312--Real estate agents.
    Respondent's obligation to respond: Mandatory. 40 CFR 475.
    Estimated number of potential respondents: 39,979,082.
    Frequency of response: On occasion.
    Total estimated average number of responses for each respondent: 1.
    Total estimated burden: 4,456,371 hours (per year). Burden is 
defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b).
    Total estimated costs: $130,820,508 (per year), includes $0 
annualized capital investment or maintenance and operational costs.

III. Are there changes in the estimates from the last approval?

    There is a decrease of 1,024,698 hours in the total estimated 
respondent burden compared with that identified in the ICR currently 
approved by OMB. This change reflects EPA's updating of burden 
estimates for this collection based recent data on the number of home 
sales and new rental agreements over the past few years, as well as the 
number of real estate agents assisting buyers, sellers, and lessors of 
properties. This change is adjustment.

IV. What is the next step in the process for this ICR?

    EPA will consider the comments received and amend the ICR as 
appropriate. The final ICR package will then be submitted to OMB for 
review

[[Page 54326]]

and approval pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.12. EPA will issue another Federal 
Register document pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.5(a)(1)(iv) to announce the 
submission of the ICR to OMB and the opportunity to submit additional 
comments to OMB. If you have any questions about this ICR or the 
approval process, please contact the person listed under FOR FURTHER 
INFORMATION CONTACT.
    Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

    Dated: November 22, 2025.

Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Chemical Safety and 
Pollution Prevention.
