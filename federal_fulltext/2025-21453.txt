SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title of Collection: Consumer Complaint Intake System Company 
Portal Boarding Form.
    OMB Control Number: 3170-0054.
    Type of Review: Extension of a currently approved information 
collection.
    Affected Public: Private sector.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 400.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 85.
    Abstract: Section 1013(b)(3)(A) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, requires the 
CFPB to ``facilitate the centralized collection of, monitoring of, and 
response to consumer complaints regarding consumer financial products 
or services.'' \1\ In furtherance of its statutory mandates related to 
consumer complaints, the CFPB utilizes a Consumer Complaint Intake 
System Company Portal Boarding Form (Boarding Form) to sign up 
companies for access to the secure, web-based Company Portal (Company 
Portal). The Company Portal allows companies to view and respond to 
complaints submitted to the CFPB, supports the efficient routing of 
consumer complaints to companies, and enables a timely and secure 
response by companies to the CFPB and consumers.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Codified at 12 U.S.C. 5493(b)(3)(A). See also Dodd-Frank 
Act, sec. 1034 (discussing responses to consumer complaints), 
codified at 12 U.S.C. 5534; sec. 1021(c)(2) (noting that one of the 
CFPB's primary functions is ``collecting, investigating, and 
responding to consumer complaints''), codified at 12 U.S.C. 
5511(c)(2).
    \2\ In addition to the Boarding Form for companies, the Bureau 
utilizes separate OMB-approved forms to board government agencies 
and congressional offices onto their own distinct portals to access 
certain complaint information through OMB Control Number 3170-0057 
(Consumer Response Government and Congressional Boarding Forms; 
expires 12/31/2027).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Request for Comments: The CFPB published a 60-day Federal Register 
notice on May 22, 2025 (90 FR 21905) under Docket Number: CFPB-2025-
0027. The CFPB is publishing this notice and soliciting comments on: 
(a) Whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the CFPB, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; (b) The accuracy of the CFPB's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information, including the 
validity of the methods and the assumptions used; (c) Ways to enhance 
the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; 
and (d) Ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Comments submitted 
in response to this notice will be reviewed by OMB as part of its 
review of this request. All comments will become a matter of public 
record.

Anthony May,
Paperwork Reduction Act Officer, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
