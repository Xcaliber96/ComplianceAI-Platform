SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title; Associated Form; and OMB Number: Naval Academy Information 
Program Blue and Gold Officer Application; USNA Form 1531/1; OMB 
Control Number 0703-0081.
    Type of Request: Extension.
    Number of Respondents: 250.
    Responses per Respondent: 1.
    Annual Responses: 250.
    Average Burden per Response: 20 minutes.
    Annual Burden Hours: 83.
    Needs and Uses: This information collection is necessary to 
determine the eligibility and leadership potential of respondents 
applying to represent the United States Naval Academy (USNA) as 
volunteer Blue and Gold Officers. Prior military service, current and 
past military performance, and prior affiliation with the USNA has been 
found to be an excellent predictor of success as a Blue and Gold 
Officer. Without this information, the ability for the USNA to recruit 
qualified Blue and Gold Officers would be impacted and would negatively 
affect the Academy's ability to recruit qualified candidates.
    Affected Public: Individuals or households.
    Frequency: On occasion.
    Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary.
    DoD Clearance Officer: Mr. Reginald Lucas.

    Dated: November 21, 2025.

Alternate OSD Federal Register Liaison Officer, Department of Defense.
