14 CFR Part 39

[Docket No. FAA-2024-2144; Project Identifier AD-2024-00424-T; 
Amendment 39-23174; AD 2025-21-02]
RIN 2120-AA64


Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-15-
06, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 777-200, -200LR, -
300, -300ER, and 777F series airplanes. AD 2022-15-06 required 
disconnecting certain connectors and capping and stowing the wires that 
had been attached to the affected transorb modules. Since the FAA 
issued AD 2022-15-06, the agency has determined additional connectors 
are affected. Also, a replacement has been developed to address the 
unsafe condition, which would terminate the existing actions. This AD 
continues to require the actions specified in AD 2022-15-06 and 
requires those actions for additional connectors. This AD also requires 
determining if affected transorb modules are installed, replacing or 
testing affected transorb modules, and applicable on-condition actions. 
This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is 
issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

DATES: This AD is effective January 2, 2026.
    The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by 
reference of a certain publication listed in this AD as of January 2, 
2026.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 
CFR part 39 to supersede AD 2022-15-06, Amendment 39-22126 (87 FR 
47334, August 3, 2022) (AD 2022-15-06). AD 2022-15-06 applied to all 
The Boeing Company Model 777-200, -200LR, -300, -300ER, and 777F series 
airplanes. The NPRM was published in the Federal Register on September 
26, 2024 (89 FR 78827). The NPRM was prompted by the determination that 
connectors that were not identified in AD 2022-15-06 are affected and 
by the development of a replacement action to address the unsafe 
condition, which would terminate the existing actions. In the NPRM, the 
FAA proposed to continue to require the actions specified in AD 2022-
15-06 and require those actions for additional connectors. The NPRM 
also proposed to require determining if affected transorb modules are 
installed, replacing or testing affected transorb modules, and 
applicable on-condition actions. The NPRM also proposed to prohibit the 
installation of affected parts. The NPRM was prompted by high 
electrical resistance within the gust suppression sensor (GSS) transorb 
modules due to corrosion on the transorb threads and insufficient 
engagement of the anti-rotation teeth. The FAA is issuing this AD to 
address high electrical resistance in both transorb modules, which can 
result in two actuator control electronics (ACEs) being exposed to 
damaging lightning transient voltages in excess of the qualification 
levels, potentially inducing erroneous or oscillatory outputs to flight 
control surfaces. The unsafe condition, if not addressed, could result 
in loss of control of the airplane.

Discussion of Final Airworthiness Directive

Comments

    The FAA received comments from Air Line Pilots Association, 
International (ALPA), and Cathay Pacific, who supported the NPRM 
without change.
    The FAA received additional comments from five commenters, 
including American Airlines, Boeing, FedEx Express, and United Airlines 
(United). The following presents the comments received on the NPRM and 
the FAA's response to each comment.

Request To Revise the Applicability

    Boeing requested that paragraph (c) of the proposed AD be revised 
to limit the applicability to the airplanes affected by Boeing Alert 
Requirements Bulletin 777-27A0125 RB, dated February 3, 2023. Boeing 
stated that if the AD applies to all The Boeing Company Model 777-200, 
-200LR, -300, -300ER, and 777F series airplanes (including the 
airplanes after line number 1726-the airplanes that will have this 
change already incorporated in production), then the airplanes 
delivered after the effective date of this AD would need to document 
that these AD actions were incorporated in production in an AD Letter 
(ADL), stating that the airplane is not affected by the AD.
    The FAA disagrees with Boeing's request that paragraph (c) of this 
AD be revised because the transorbs are rotable and these parts could 
later be installed on airplanes that were initially delivered with 
acceptable parts, thereby subjecting those airplanes to the unsafe 
condition. All airplanes are subject to the parts installation 
prohibition specified in paragraph (k) of this AD, which does not allow 
affected parts to be installed as of the effective date of the AD.
    The FAA notes that airplanes produced after the effective date of 
this AD do not need to document that the actions in Boeing Alert 
Requirements Bulletin 777-27A0125 RB, dated February 3, 2023, were done 
because paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this AD only apply to airplanes 
produced on or before the effective date of this AD. Additionally, the 
FAA has revised paragraphs (g) and (h) of this AD to limit those 
requirements to airplanes produced on or before the effective date of 
this AD since airplanes produced after the effective date of this AD 
will not be delivered with the affected transorb modules or connectors.

Request To Allow Optional Action to the Replacement of Required Actions

    FedEx Express requested that the FAA revise paragraph (i)(2) of the 
proposed AD to allow continued flight with the GSS connectors stowed 
per paragraphs (g) and (h) of the proposed AD, as an optional action. 
The commenter stated that the reactivation in paragraph (i)(2) of the 
proposed AD does not appear to lend any effort towards airworthiness of 
the aircraft outside of passenger comfort. Additionally, the commenter 
noted that such a system is not a requirement of 14 CFR part 25 and 
therefore expenditure of valuable time and resources on a system not 
appreciably utilized by a cargo carrier would seem pointless.
    The FAA acknowledges the commenter's request. The purpose of this 
AD is to restore the affected fleet to an acceptable level of safety. 
The FAA is issuing this AD to address high electrical resistance in 
both transorb modules, which can result in two actuator control 
electronics (ACEs) being exposed to damaging lightning transient 
voltages in excess of the qualification levels, potentially inducing 
erroneous or oscillatory outputs to flight control surfaces and could 
result in loss of control of the airplane. Allowing the connectors to 
be disconnected long-term may not address the unsafe condition in the 
affected fleet, as an operator may inadvertently reconnect the affected 
connectors in the future. Therefore, the replacement of affected 
connectors must be done to address the unsafe condition. However, any 
person may request approval of an alternative method of compliance 
(AMOC) under the provisions of paragraph (l)(2) of this AD. This AD has 
not been changed regarding this request.

Request for Removing/Revising Paragraphs (g) and (h) of the Proposed AD 
and References to Connector D02099P

    Boeing requested that the FAA remove paragraph (h) of the proposed 
AD, update paragraph (g) of the proposed AD by referring to bundle/
connector W6313/D02098P, and remove references to connector D02099P 
from ``Actions Since AD-2022-15-06 Was Issued'' in the NPRM. Boeing 
suggested some revised wording for paragraph (g) of the proposed AD to 
account for additional wire to bundles/connector part numbers that are 
present on some

[[Page 54557]]

airplanes. Boeing stated paragraph (h) of the proposed AD could be 
misleading to operators as it does not highlight that the difference in 
the bundle and connector callouts are line number dependent. In 
addition, Boeing stated the connectors called out in paragraph (h) of 
the proposed AD are incorrect and reference two disconnect points on 
the same wire bundle. Boeing recommended that connector D02099P not be 
referenced as a disconnect point in the NPRM.
    United requested that the FAA revise paragraph (h) of the proposed 
AD to allow for disconnecting one of the connectors rather than the 
referenced ``W6313/D02098P and W7314/D02099P,'' which would require 
operators to unnecessarily disconnect both. United stated that the 
connectors are in the same wiring circuit so disconnecting either 
connector D02098P or D02099P would effectively deactivate the upper 
gust suppression transducer circuit. United noted it has disconnected, 
capped, and stowed connector D02099P and connector D02098P remains 
connected for these aircraft as allowed in AMOC letter 783-22-11124, 
dated January 17, 2023.
    American Airlines requested that the FAA change references to wire 
bundles/connectors from ``W6313/D02098P and W7314/D02099P'' to ``W6313/
D02098P or W7314/D02099P,'' as disconnecting either from the transorb 
module sufficiently complies with the level of safety required by the 
proposed AD.
    The FAA agrees with rewording paragraph (h) of this AD to address 
the two disconnect points of the wire bundles being referenced as 
``W6313/D02098P and W7314/D02099P'' to ``W6313/D02098P or W7314/
D02099P'' to alleviate confusion of referencing disconnecting both from 
the transorb module; the disconnection of either bundle/connector 
provides an equivalent level of safety. Paragraph (h) of this AD has 
been updated to the reference above.
    The FAA disagrees with removing paragraph (h) of this AD and 
updating paragraph (g) of this AD because either bundles/connectors 
W6313/D02098P or W7314/D02099P can be disconnected to address the 
unsafe condition. This AD has not been changed to remove the actions 
required by paragraph (h) of this AD.
    Regarding the request to revise the wording in paragraph (g) of 
this AD, the FAA agrees to clarify. AMOC letter 783-22-11124, dated 
January 17, 2023, allows operators to use the wording suggested by 
Boeing. Paragraph (l)(4) of this AD allows operators to use AMOCs 
previously approved for AD 2022-15-06 for the corresponding provisions 
of paragraph (g) of this AD. Therefore, no change to this AD is 
necessary.
    Regarding the request to revise ``Actions Since AD-2022-15-06 Was 
Issued'' in the NPRM, that language is not restated in this final rule; 
however, the FAA acknowledges that the text should have stated 
``disconnect the connectors and cap and stow the wires to bundles/
connectors W6313/D02098P or W7314/D02099P.''

Conclusion

    The FAA reviewed the relevant data, considered any comments 
received, and determined that air safety requires adopting this AD as 
proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe 
condition on these products. Except for minor editorial changes, and 
any other changes described previously, this AD is adopted as proposed 
in the NPRM. None of the changes will increase the economic burden on 
any operator.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed Boeing Alert Requirements Bulletin 777-27A0125 RB, 
dated February 3, 2023. This material specifies procedures for 
replacing affected transorb modules with new or serviceable transorb 
modules or testing affected transorb modules and accomplishing 
applicable on-condition actions. The on-condition actions include part 
marking any module that meets certain specifications or replacing any 
modules that do not meet the specifications.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 312 airplanes of U.S. 
registry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:

                                                 Estimated Costs

    The FAA estimates the following costs to do any necessary on-
condition actions that would be required based on the results of the 
testing. The agency has no way of determining the number of aircraft 
that might need these actions:

                                               On-Condition Costs

[[Page 54558]]

    The FAA has included all known costs in its cost estimate. 
According to the manufacturer, however, some or all of the costs of 
this AD may be covered under warranty, thereby reducing the cost impact 
on affected operators.

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, 
on the relationship between the national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various 
levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
