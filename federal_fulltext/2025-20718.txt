    Title: Priority Processing Request (VA Form 20-10207).
    OMB Control Number: 2900-NEW. <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRASearch">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRASearch</a> (Once at this link, you can enter the OMB Control Number to

    Type of Review: New collection.
    Abstract: VA Form 20-10207 is used by VA to gather the necessary 
information to determine priority processing of a claim due to special 
circumstances or status. Without this information, VA would not be able 
to identify claims for priority processing for those claimants who are 
in urgent or immediate need due to changed circumstances. VA would also 
utilize this information collection for reporting purposes and for 
outreach efforts for those claimants. VA Form 20-10207 was previously 
under 2900-0877 and due to a program office change, a new control 
number is requested to be assigned.
    Affected Public: Individuals or Households.
    Estimated Annual Burden: 6,380 hours.
    Estimated Average Burden per Respondent: 7 minutes.
    Frequency of Response: One time.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 54,685 per year.
    Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

Lanea Haynes,
Acting, VA PRA Clearance Officer, (Alt) Office of Enterprise and 
Integration/Data Governance Analytics, Department of Veterans Affairs.
