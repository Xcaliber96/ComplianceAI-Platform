II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. Chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a request for renewal of 
an existing collection of information to OMB for review entitled, NRC 
Form 664, ``General Licensee Registration.'' The NRC hereby informs 
potential respondents that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and 
that a person is not required to respond to, a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on June 13, 2025, 90 FR 25088.
    1. The title of the information collection: NRC Form 664, General 
Licensee Registration.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0198.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: NRC Form 664.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: Annually.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: General licensees who 
possess registerable quantities of byproduct material.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 425.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 425.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 142.
    10. Abstract: NRC Form 664 is used by NRC general licensees to make 
reports regarding certain generally licensed devices subject to annual 
registration. The registration program allows NRC to better track 
general licensees, so that they can be contacted or inspected as 
necessary, and to make sure that generally licensed devices can be 
identified even if lost or damaged. Also, the registration program 
ensures that general licensees are aware of and understand the 
requirements for the possession, use, and disposal of devices 
containing byproduct material. Greater awareness helps to ensure that 
general licensees will comply with the regulatory requirements for 
proper handling and disposal of generally licensed devices and would 
reduce the potential for incidents that could result in unnecessary 
radiation exposure to the public and contamination of property.

    Dated: November 24, 2025.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Heather Dempsey,
Acting NRC Clearance Officer, Office of the Chief Information Officer.
