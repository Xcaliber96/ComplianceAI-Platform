    Type of Review: Extension without change of a currently approved

    Abstract: The National Public Education Financial Survey (NPEFS) is 
an annual collection of state-level finance data that has been included 
in the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core of 
Data (CCD) since FY 1982 (school year 1981-82). The U.S. Census Bureau 
(Census), Economic Reimbursable Surveys Division, administers the NPEFS 
data collection for NCES under interagency agreement in conjunction 
with the Local Education Agency (School District) Finance Survey (F-33) 
(OMB #0607-0700) and the School-Level Finance Survey (SLFS) (OMB #1850-
0930). NPEFS is a comprehensive source of state-level finance data for 
public education collected on a nationwide scale using uniform 
definitions, concepts, and procedures. The collection includes the 
revenues,

[[Page 53279]]

expenditures, and average daily attendance of all publicly funded 
schools and elementary-secondary local education agencies (LEAs), state 
payments on behalf of LEAs, and state support for a free public 
education for students in prekindergarten through 12th grade. In this 
notice, NCES is announcing its intention to extend the date of 
clearance for NPEFS, without change, to the currently approved 
collection.
    Detailed information about the collection, including the currently 
approved collection, can be found at <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAOMBHistory?ombControlNumber=1850-0067">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAOMBHistory?ombControlNumber=1850-0067</a>.
    NPEFS data are used to calculate a state's ``average per-pupil 
expenditure'' (SPPE) for elementary and secondary education, as defined 
by Title 20 U.S.C., Section 7801, paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 12, 26, and 48. 
SPPE data are used in calculating allocations for certain formula grant 
programs, including, but not limited to, Title I, Part A, of the 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), Impact Aid, and 
Indian Education programs. Other programs, such as the Education for 
Homeless Children and Youth program under title VII of the McKinney-
Vento Homeless Assistance Act, and the Student Support and Academic 
Enrichment Grants under title IV, part A of the ESEA make use of SPPE 
data indirectly because their formulas are based, in whole or in part, 
on State title I, part A, allocations.
    Data will be collected from State Education Agencies (SEAs) for all 
50 states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Northern 
Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. SEAs 
appoint state fiscal coordinators to work with NCES and the U.S. Census 
Bureau to provide accurate and comparable data across states and 
jurisdictions. SEAs typically collect finance data from school 
districts for their own uses. Many states produce a state-specific 
chart of accounts or accounting manual to assist school districts in 
classifying and reporting finance data and producing government-wide 
financial statements. Uniform definitions and concepts of revenues and 
expenditures are defined by the NCES handbook Financial Accounting for 
Local and State School Systems.
    Comparative data on resources and spending patterns is helpful for 
states to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs and services. 
The products of this data collection make it possible for data users to 
search within a single database to obtain information on such things as 
instruction and student support services expenditures per pupil; 
expenditures on salaries and benefits, supplies, and purchased 
services; and the percent of school system funding from state, local, 
and federal sources. Education finance statistics provided by this 
collection allow for state-level comparisons of how public elementary-
secondary education systems receive their funding and how they are 
spending their funds.
