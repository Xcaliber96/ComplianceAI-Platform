Project: Data Resource Toolkit Protocol for the Crisis Counseling 
Assistance and Training Program (OMB No. 0930-0270)--Reinstatement

    The SAMHSA Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), as part of an 
interagency agreement with the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA), provides a toolkit to be used for the purposes of collecting 
data on the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP). 
The CCP provides supplemental funding to states, territories, and 
tribes for individual and community crisis intervention services after 
a presidentially declared major disaster.
    The CCP has provided disaster behavioral health services to 
millions of disaster survivors since its inception, and, with more than 
40 years of accumulated expertise, it has become an important model for 
federal response to a variety of catastrophic events. Recent CCP grants 
have been issued for nearly all 50 states, 5 territories, and at least 
4 tribes. These grants have helped survivors of disasters such as 
Hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024; the catastrophic Maui wildfire in 
2023; and other wildfires, severe storms, flooding, earthquakes, and 
tornadoes in 2022 through 2025. CCPs address the short-term behavioral 
health needs of communities primarily through (a) outreach and public 
education, (b) individual and group counseling, and (c) referral. 
Outreach and public education serve primarily to make people aware of 
common disaster reactions and to engage people who may need further 
care. Crisis counseling assists survivors in coping with current stress 
and symptoms to return to pre-disaster functioning. Crisis counseling 
relies largely on ``active listening,'' \1\ and crisis counselors also 
provide education (especially about the nature of responses to 
disaster, adversity, and trauma) and help participants build coping 
skills. Crisis counselors \2\ typically work with a single participant 
once or a few times. Because crisis counseling is time-limited, 
referral is the third important function of CCPs. Counselors are 
expected to refer survivors to formal treatment if they have developed 
a mental and/or substance use disorder or are having difficulty in 
coping with their disaster reactions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Active listening requires the crisis counselor to engage 
fully with the survivor to understand what the survivor is 
communicating. The crisis counselor engages in activities such as 
asking questions, encouraging the survivor to respond candidly, 
reflecting on what the survivor says, and not judging the survivor's 
experiences or statements.
    \2\ CCP crisis counselors are paraprofessionals (e.g., outreach 
workers, community health workers, resource linkage coordinators) 
trained to work with individuals, families, and groups to provide 
short-term counseling and support. Crisis counselors also assess 
survivors for reactions requiring referrals, and they provide 
referrals as needed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Data about services delivered and users of services are collected 
throughout the program period. The data are collected via the use of a 
toolkit that relies on standardized forms. At the program level, the 
data are entered quickly and easily into a cumulative database mainly 
through mobile data entry or paper forms to yield summary tables for 
quarterly and final reports for the program. Data entry allows for the 
data to be uploaded and linked to a national database that houses data 
collected across CCPs. The standardized data collection and database 
allow SAMHSA CMHS and FEMA to produce summary reports of services 
provided across all programs funded.
    The components of the toolkit are listed and described below:
    <bullet> Encounter logs. These forms document all services 
provided. The CCP requires crisis counselors to complete these logs. 
There are three types of encounter logs: (1) Individual/Family Crisis 
Counseling Services Encounter Log, (2) Group Encounter Log, and (3) 
Weekly Tally Sheet.
    [cir] Individual/Family Crisis Counseling Services Encounter Log. 
Crisis counseling is defined as an interaction that lasts at least 15 
minutes and involves participant-provided information. This form is 
completed by the crisis counselor for each participant, defined as the 
person or people who actively participated in the session (that is, by 
engaging in conversation), not someone who was merely present. One form 
may be completed for all family or household members who are actively 
engaged in the visit. Information collected includes demographics, 
service characteristics, risk factors, event reactions, and referral 
data.
    [cir] Group Encounter Log. This form is used to collect data on 
either a group crisis counseling encounter or a group public education 
encounter. The crisis counselor indicates in a checkbox the class of 
activities (that is, counseling or education). Information collected 
includes service characteristics, group identity and characteristics, 
and group activities.
    [cir] Weekly Tally Sheet. This form documents brief educational and 
supportive encounters not captured on any other form. Information 
collected includes service characteristics, daily tallies, and weekly 
totals for brief educational or supportive contacts, material 
distribution with no or minimal interaction, and social media activity.
    <bullet> Assessment and referral tools (ARTs). These tools--one for 
adults and one for children and youth--can be administered at any time 
if the crisis counselor feels the participant is exhibiting distress or 
they would benefit from referral to other services. It is recommended 
that the ARTs be administered during encounters where more than four 
event reactions or certain risk categories are indicated. These tools 
will typically be used beginning 3 months after the disaster and will 
be completed by the crisis counselor.
    <bullet> Participant Feedback Survey Form. These surveys are 
completed by and collected from a sample of participants, not every 
participant. Sampling is done on a biannual basis 6 months and 1 year 
after the disaster. Information collected includes satisfaction with 
services, perceived improvements in coping and functioning, types of 
exposure, and event reactions.
    <bullet> Service Provider Feedback Form. These surveys are 
completed by and collected from the CCP service providers anonymously 
at 6 months and 1 year after the disaster. The survey is coded on 
several program-level as well as provider-level variables. However,

[[Page 52988]]

the program survey data are only shared with program management if more 
than 10 individual provider staff members complete the survey.
    There are no changes to the Weekly Tally Sheet since its last 
approval. Revisions to the Individual Encounter Log include updating 
the collection of adult age information to align with SAMHSA reporting 
convention, race and ethnicity information to align with updates to OMB 
guidance, and sex information to align with White House guidance; 
removing the question about recent immigration; adding ``stress 
management'' to the example for ``managing physical and emotional 
reactions''; adding a separate referral option for ``FEMA-funded 
programs;'' and changing ``self-help groups'' to ``self-help or support 
groups.'' For the Group Encounter Log, changes include updating the 
collection of race and ethnicity information to align with OMB 
guidance, adding a question about primary language spoken during the 
encounter, removing the question about recent immigration, and adding 
``stress management'' to the example for ``managing physical and 
emotional reactions.''
    For the Adult and Child/Youth ARTs, edits were made to update the 
collection of adult age information to align with SAMHSA reporting 
convention, race and ethnicity information to align with updated OMB 
guidance, and sex information to align with White House guidance; frame 
demographic information collection as questions; add a graphic showing 
response options, change ``self-help groups'' to ``self-help or support 
groups,'' and include a separate referral option for ``FEMA-funded 
programs''; and remove questions related to recent immigration and 
suicidal ideation. In addition, since the diagnostic criteria for 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) changed in the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the PTSD 
assessment tool within the Child/Youth ART was updated to align with 
the new PTSD criteria via the validated and abbreviated University of 
California at Los Angeles PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-5 (Reaction 
Index-5) tool. The Child/Youth ART was also updated to use the terms 
``caregiver'' and ``child or youth'' throughout, move the statement 
that is read to the respondents, and add a question about whether the 
primary respondent was the caregiver or child or youth.
    Changes to the collection of age, race, ethnicity, sex, and 
disaster-related experiences information were made to the Participant 
Feedback Survey and Service Provider Feedback Forms to align with 
encounter and ART forms. In addition, the Participant Feedback Survey 
Form was updated to state more explicitly that the form is voluntary 
and the respondent may skip questions; add ``prefer not to answer'' 
options; ask about referral to ``FEMA-funded programs''; add ``using/
misusing other substances'' to the examples for the ``In the past month 
to what extent have you had trouble taking care of your health (e.g., 
eating poorly, not getting enough rest, smoking more, drinking more)?'' 
question; add a sentence noting that if the respondent was not impacted 
by the disaster, they should skip the next set of questions; and update 
response options for the question about education and household income.
    The Service Provider Feedback Form language was further changed to 
include ``resources'' when asking providers to rate ``support, 
training, and resources provided to help you avoid compassion fatigue 
or to cope with the stress of listening to and helping others''; update 
the response options for questions about education and household 
income; and add a sentence noting that if the respondent was not 
impacted by the disaster, they should skip the next set of questions. 
The estimates of the annualized burden hours are provided in Table 1.

\1\ The value for estimated number of respondents (800) is based on a typical average of 40 crisis counselors
  (or 40 full-time equivalents [FTEs]) per grant with an approximate average of 20 grants per year (i.e., 40 x
  20 = 800).
\2\ On average, each FTE crisis counselor completes 200 forms over 1 year.
\3\ On average, a pair of crisis counselors completes 1 form per week (i.e., 2 counselors completing 1 form =
  400 crisis counselors) for 33 weeks.
\4\ The average length of a CCP grant is 52 weeks.
\5\ On average, 5% of the Individual/Family Crisis Counseling Services Encounter Logs completed result in the
  use of the assessment and referral tools (i.e., 160,000 individual x 5% = 8,000, which equals the total Adult
  and Child/Youth Assessment and Referral Tool responses).
\6\ On average, 50% of service providers/crisis counselors may complete or use this tool.
