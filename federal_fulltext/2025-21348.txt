SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Proposed Project

    The CAHPS Home and Community-Based Services Survey (HCBS-CAHPS 
Survey) is the first cross-disability survey of home and community-
based service beneficiaries' experience receiving long-term services 
and supports. It is designed to facilitate comparisons across state 
Medicaid HCBS programs throughout the country that target adults with 
disabilities, e.g., including older adults, individuals with physical 
disabilities, persons with developmental or intellectual disabilities, 
those with acquired brain injury and persons with severe mental 
illness.
    The HCBS-CAHPS Database serves as a primary source of data 
available to states, agency programs and researchers to help answer 
important questions related to beneficiary experiences. AHRQ, through 
its contractor, collects and make available de-identified survey data, 
enabling HCBS programs to identify areas where quality can be improved.
    The HCBS-CAHPS Database supports AHRQ's goals of promoting 
improvements in the quality and patient-centeredness of health care in 
home or community-based care settings.
    The HCBS-CAHPS Survey was developed by the Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services (CMS) for voluntary use by state Medicaid programs, 
including both fee-for-service HCBS programs as well as managed long-
term services and supports (MLTSS) programs. States with adequate 
sample sizes may consider using survey metrics in value-based 
purchasing initiatives.
    This research seeks to answer the following questions:
    1. What are the key drivers of patient experience in HCBS programs?
    2. How do beneficiary experiences with HCBS vary across states and 
program types?

[[Page 54691]]

    3. What are the highest and lowest scoring measures in specific 
domains of HCBS delivery of care?
    This research has the following goals:
    1. Produce aggregated results from HCBS-CAHPS survey users that 
voluntarily submit their data; and
    2. Provide feedback reports to HCBS-CAHPS survey users that 
voluntarily submit their data to help them identify their strengths and 
areas for improvement in patient care.
    This study is being conducted by AHRQ through its contractor, 
Westat, pursuant to AHRQ's statutory authority to conduct and support 
research on health care and on systems for the delivery of such care, 
including activities with respect to the quality, effectiveness, 
efficiency, appropriateness and vale of healthcare services and with 
respect to quality measurement and improvement [42 U.S.C 299a(a)(1), 
(2) and (8)].
    The development and operation of the HCBS-CAHPS Database will 
include the following major components undertaken by AHRQ through its 
contractor.
    1. Program Recruitment. Outreach will be conducted with the HCBS-
CAHPS user community (including state agencies, managed long-term 
services and supports (MLTSS) programs, centers for independent living, 
improvement collaborative organizations, survey vendors, etc.) to 
promote the database and its benefits and encourage voluntary 
contributions of survey data. A variety of communications will be used 
(e.g., GovDelivery announcements, personal email messages, conference 
and meeting presentations, etc.) to present the value case for the 
database and key dates and details about submitting data.
    2. Data Submission Platform. AHRQ's contractor currently provides a 
web-based user-friendly submission platform for both the CAHPS Health 
Plan and CAHPS Child Hospital survey data. This platform was used as a 
model to develop the HCBS-CAHPS Database submission system, including 
data submission specifications; technical assistance and step-by-step 
instructions for participation; analysis programs for data cleaning and 
reporting; and data use agreements to protect the confidentiality of 
the participating organizations and their data.
    3. Submission Notifications and Instructions. Clear instructions 
and notifications are of paramount importance for successful submission 
of valid data, seamless report dissemination, and streamlined 
communication with survey vendors, state programs, or other submitters.

Method of Collection

    The development and operation of the HCBS-CAHPS Database will 
include the following data collection activities:
    <bullet> Registration with the site to obtain an account with a 
secure username and password;
    <bullet> Submission of DUAs and survey questionnaires;
    <bullet> Submission of program information form;
    <bullet> Submission of de-identified survey data files,
    <bullet> Generation of status reports indicating that submitted 
files are either accepted or rejected; and
    <bullet> Follow-up with submitters in the event of a rejected file, 
to assist in making corrections and resubmitting the file.

Estimated Annual Respondent Burden

    Exhibit 1 shows the estimated burden hours for the respondents to 
participate in the database. The 51 POCs in Exhibit 1 represent the 51 
states or agencies that will administer the Adult HCBS survey. An 
estimated thirteen survey vendors will assist them.
    Each POC will:
    1. Register online for submission. The online registration form 
will require about five minutes to complete.
    2. Complete a program information form of information about each 
program such as the name of the program, program size, state, etc. The 
online program information form takes on average 5 minutes to complete.
    3. Complete a DUA. The DUA requires about 3 minutes to sign and 
return by fax or mail.
    Each submitter, which in most cases will be the survey vendor 
performing the data collection, will provide a copy of their 
questionnaire and the survey data file in the required file format. 
Survey data files must conform to the data file layout specifications 
provided by the HCBS-CAHPS Database. Since the unit of analysis is at 
the program level, submitters will upload one data file per program. 
Once a data file is uploaded the file will be automatically checked to 
ensure it conforms to the specifications and a data file status report 
will be produced and made available to the submitter. Submitters will 
review each report and will be expected to correct any errors in their 
data file and resubmit if necessary. It will take about one hour to 
submit the data for each program.
    The total burden is estimated to be 63 hours annually.
