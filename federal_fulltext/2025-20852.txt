14 CFR Part 39

[Docket No. FAA-2025-5032; Project Identifier AD-2025-01042-R]
RIN 2120-AA64


Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 
2025-06-04, which applies to all Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, 
AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350B3, AS350BA,

[[Page 53239]]

AS350D, AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, AS355NP, EC130B4, and 
EC130T2 helicopters. AD 2025-06-04 requires repetitively inspecting the 
main gearbox (MGB) bevel wheel and the MGB magnetic plug for particles 
and performing corrective actions if applicable and prohibits 
installing an affected MGB unless certain requirements are met. Since 
the FAA issued AD 2025-06-04, the FAA determined that AD 2025-06-04 
contains errors in the interval compliance times. This proposed AD 
would continue to require the actions of AD 2025-06-04 and revise the 
interval compliance times. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the 
unsafe condition on these products.

DATES: The FAA must receive comments on this proposed AD by January 9, 
2026.

this rulemaking.

Background

    The FAA issued AD 2025-06-04, Amendment 39-22992 (90 FR 14723, 
April 4, 2025) (AD 2025-06-04), for all Airbus Helicopters Model 
AS350B, AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350B3, AS350BA, AS350D, AS355E, AS355F, 
AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, AS355NP, EC130B4, and EC130T2 helicopters. AD 
2025-06-04 was prompted by EASA AD 2023-0044, dated February 28, 2023 
(EASA AD 2023-0044) (also referred to as the MCAI), issued by EASA, 
which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the European 
Union. The MCAI states that after a fleet design review for detection 
of particles in the MGB, it was determined that additional maintenance 
actions are necessary to improve detection of particles in MGB that 
have certain part-numbered planet gear bearings installed. AD 2025-06-
04 requires repetitively inspecting the MGB bevel wheel and the MGB 
magnetic plug for the presence of particles, close monitoring of the 
MGB magnetic plug if particles are detected, and replacing the 
epicyclic module if necessary. The AD also prohibits installing an 
affected MGB unless certain requirements are met. The agency issued AD 
2025-06-04 to detect and correct the presence of particles in the MGB 
which, if not addressed, could result in reduced or loss of control of 
the helicopter.

Actions Since AD 2025-06-04 Was Issued

    Since the FAA issued AD 2025-06-04, the FAA determined that there 
are errors in the interval compliance times in Table 1 to paragraph 
(h)(6)(i) of AD 2025-06-04. Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350B1, 
AS350BA, AS350D, AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and AS355NP 
helicopters should have an interval compliance time of 100 hours time-
in-service (TIS) instead of 30 hours TIS. Also, Airbus Helicopters 
Model EC130B4 helicopters should have an interval compliance time of 
100 hours TIS instead of 150 hours TIS.

FAA's Determination

    The FAA is issuing this NPRM after determining that the unsafe 
condition described previously is likely to exist or develop on other 
products of the same type design.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2023-0044, which specifies procedures for 
repetitive borescope visual inspections of the bevel wheel of the 
affected MGB for particles, collecting and analyzing any particles 
detected, and depending on the results, accomplishing further actions, 
accomplishing corrective action in accordance with the ASB, or 
contacting AH [Airbus Helicopters] for further corrective action. EASA 
AD 2023-0044 also specifies procedures for accomplishing a borescope 
visual

[[Page 53240]]

inspection of the bevel wheel of the affected MGB for particles 
following the detection of any particles at the MGB magnetic plug 
during accomplishment of certain maintenance tasks and depending on the 
results, taking corrective action. EASA AD 2023-0044 also prohibits 
installing an affected MGB on any helicopter unless certain 
requirements are met.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Proposed AD Requirements in This NPRM

    This proposed AD would continue to require the actions of AD 2025-
06-04, except that this proposed AD would revise the interval 
compliance times. The actions proposed in this AD are specified in EASA 
AD 2023-0044, described previously, as incorporated by reference, 
except for any differences identified as exceptions in the regulatory 
text of this proposed AD. See ``Differences Between this Proposed AD 
and the MCAI'' for a discussion of the general differences included in 
this proposed AD.

Differences Between This Proposed AD and the MCAI

    The MCAI applies to Model AS350BB helicopters, whereas this 
proposed AD would not because that model does not have an FAA type 
certificate.
    Where Note 1 in the material referenced in the MCAI specifies the 
option of 1 mechanical technician and 1 crew member, for this proposed 
AD, the pilot is only permitted to turn the tail rotor (b) because the 
other actions specified in the note must be accomplished by persons 
authorized under 14 CFR 43.3. Therefore, for the purposes of this 
proposed AD, the owner/operator (pilot) may turn the tail rotor (b) and 
must enter compliance with the applicable paragraph of this proposed AD 
in the helicopter maintenance records in accordance with 14 CFR 43.9(a) 
and 91.417(a)(2)(v). The pilot may perform this action because it only 
involves turning the tail rotor (b). This action can be performed 
equally well by a pilot or a mechanic. This action is an exception to 
the FAA's standard maintenance regulations.
    This proposed AD would not require complying with paragraph (2) of 
the MCAI. Instead, this proposed AD would require repetitively 
inspecting the MGB magnetic plug for particles and, if there is any 
particle, accomplishing a borescope visual inspection, as specified in 
paragraphs (h)(6)(i) and (ii) of this proposed AD.
    Where the material referenced in the MCAI specifies contacting 
Airbus Helicopters for a certain action, this proposed AD would require 
accomplishing action in accordance with a method approved by the FAA, 
EASA, or Airbus Helicopters' EASA Design Organization Approval.

Explanation of Required Compliance Information

    In the FAA's ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of the AD 
process, the FAA developed a process to use some civil aviation 
authority (CAA) ADs as the primary source of information for compliance 
with requirements for corresponding FAA ADs. The FAA has been 
coordinating this process with manufacturers and CAAs. As a result, the 
FAA proposes to incorporate EASA AD 2023-0044 by reference in the FAA 
final rule. This proposed AD would, therefore, require compliance with 
EASA AD 2023-0044 in its entirety through that incorporation, except 
for any differences identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of 
this proposed AD. Using common terms that are the same as the heading 
of a particular section in EASA AD 2023-0044 does not mean that 
operators need comply only with that section. For example, where the AD 
requirement refers to ``all required actions and compliance times,'' 
compliance with this AD requirement is not limited to the section 
titled ``Required Action(s) and Compliance Time(s)'' in EASA AD 2023-
0044. Material required by EASA AD 2023-0044 for compliance will be 
available at <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a> by searching for and locating Docket 
No. FAA-2025-5032 after the FAA final rule is published.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD, if adopted as proposed, would 
affect 522 helicopters of U.S. registry.
    The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this proposed 
AD:

                                                 Estimated Costs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                     Cost per      Cost on U.S.
               Action                         Labor cost            Parts cost        product        operators
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visually inspect MGB bevel wheel...  1 work-hour x $85 per hour               $0             $85         $44,370
                                      = $85.
Repetitively inspect magnetic plugs  1 work-hour x $85 per hour                0              85          44,370
 of the MGB.                          = $85.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The new requirements of this proposed AD add no additional economic 
burden.
    The FAA estimates the following costs to do any on-condition 
actions that would be required based on the results of the proposed 
inspections. The agency has no way of determining the number of 
helicopters that might need these on-condition actions:

                                               On-Condition Costs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Action                        Labor cost               Parts cost            Cost per product

                                        hour = $4,760.

[[Page 53241]]

 
Replace bevel reduction module.......  56 work-hours x $85 per  $18,500 (overhauled)...  $23,260 per module.
                                        hour = $4,760.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Certain corrective action could vary significantly from helicopter 
to helicopter. The FAA has no data to determine the costs to accomplish 
the corrective action.

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship 
between the national government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that the proposed 
regulation:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

(e) Unsafe Condition

    This AD was prompted by an assessment performed by the 
manufacturer which determined that additional maintenance actions 
are necessary to improve detection of particles in the main gearbox 
(MGB) with certain part-numbered planet gear bearings installed. The 
FAA is issuing this AD to detect and correct particles in the MGB. 
The unsafe condition, if not addressed, could result in reduced or 
loss of control of the helicopter.

(f) Compliance

    Comply with this AD within the compliance times specified, 
unless already done.

(g) Required Actions

    Except as specified in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this AD: Comply 
with all required actions and compliance times specified in, and in 
accordance with, European Union Aviation Safety Agency AD 2023-0044, 
dated February 28, 2023 (EASA AD 2023-0044).

(h) Exceptions to EASA AD 2023-0044

    (1) Where EASA AD 2023-0044 defines ``serviceable MGB'' as ``An 
affected MGB which has accumulated less than 330 flight hours (FH) 
since new (first installation on a helicopter), or since an 
overhaul, or since an inspection in accordance with the instructions 
of the ASB'', this AD requires replacing that text with ``An 
affected MGB which has accumulated less than 330 total hours time-
in-service (TIS) since new (zero total hours TIS), since last 
overhaul if an overhaul has been accomplished, or since last 
inspection and any specified corrective action in accordance with 
the instructions of the ASB if an inspection and any specified 
corrective action by following the instructions of the ASB have been 
accomplished''.
    (2) Where EASA AD 2023-0044 requires compliance in terms of 
flight hours, this AD requires using TIS.
    (3) Where EASA AD 2023-0044 refers to its effective date, this 
AD requires using May 9, 2025 (the effective date of AD 2025-06-04).
    (4) Where Note 1 in the material referenced in paragraph (1) of 
EASA AD 2023-0044 specifies the option of 1 mechanical technician 
and 1 crew member, for this AD, the pilot is only permitted to turn 
the tail rotor (b). The owner/operator (pilot) holding at least a 
private pilot certificate may turn the tail rotor (b) and must enter 
compliance with paragraph (g) of this AD in the helicopter 
maintenance records in accordance with 14 CFR 43.9(a) and 
91.417(a)(2)(v). The record must be maintained as required by 14 CFR 
91.417, 121.380, or 135.43. All other actions specified in Note 1 in 
the material referenced in paragraph (1) of EASA AD 2023-0044 must 
be accomplished by persons authorized under 14 CFR 43.3.
    (5) Where Note 2 in the material referenced in paragraph (1) of 
EASA AD 2023-0044 specifies contacting Airbus Helicopters [AH] for 
further instructions if the bottom of the radius (a6) of the bevel 
wheel (a3) or head screws (a4) (see Figure 2) are not clearly 
visible, this AD requires, before further flight, accomplishing 
action in accordance with a method approved by the FAA, EASA, or 
Airbus Helicopters' EASA Design Organization Approval (DOA). If 
approved by the DOA, the approval must include the DOA-authorized 
signature.
    (6) Instead of complying with paragraph (2) of EASA AD 2023-
0044, comply with the actions required by paragraphs (h)(6)(i) and 
(ii) of this AD.

[[Page 53242]]

    (i) After May 9, 2025 (the effective date of AD 2025-06-04), and 
within the compliance time intervals specified in table 1 to 
paragraph (h)(6)(i) of this AD, visually inspect the MGB magnetic 
plug for particles.

further flight, borescope inspect the bevel wheel of the affected 
MGB for particles as required by paragraph (1) of EASA AD 2023-0044. 
If there is any particle as a result of the borescope inspection of 
the bevel wheel, before further flight, collect and analyze the 
particles as required by paragraph (3) of EASA AD 2023-0044.
    (7) Where paragraph (3) of EASA AD 2023-0044 specifies ``If, 
during any inspection as required by paragraph (1) or (2) of this 
AD'', this AD requires replacing that text with ``If, during any 
inspection as required by paragraph (1) of this AD''.
    (8) Where the material referenced in paragraph (3) of EASA AD 
2023-0044 specifies performing a metallurgical analysis and 
contacting Airbus Helicopters if collected particles cannot be 
characterized with Work Card 20-08-01-601, this AD does not require 
contacting Airbus Helicopter but does require performing the 
metallurgical analysis.
    (9) Where the material referenced in paragraph (3) of EASA AD 
2023-0044 contains a special flight permit provision, this AD does 
not allow that provision but instead requires the special flight 
permit limitations in paragraph (j) of this AD.
    (10) Where the material referenced in paragraph (3) of EASA AD 
2023-0044 specifies contacting Airbus Helicopters if the damaged 
module cannot be identified, this AD requires, before further 
flight, accomplishing action in accordance with a method approved by 
the FAA, EASA, or Airbus Helicopters' EASA DOA. If approved by the 
DOA, the approval must include the DOA-authorized signature.
    (11) Where paragraph (5) of EASA AD 2023-0044 states ``to 
contact AH for corrective action(s) instructions, and within the 
compliance time specified therein, to accomplish those instructions 
accordingly'', this AD requires replacing that text with 
``accomplishing corrective actions in accordance with a method 
approved by the FAA, EASA, or Airbus Helicopters' EASA DOA. If 
approved by the DOA, the approval must include the DOA-authorized 
signature''.
    (12) Where paragraph (7) of EASA AD 2023-0044 states ``since new 
(first installation a helicopter), or since an overhaul, or since an 
inspection in accordance with the instructions of the ASB, as 
applicable, and, thereafter, as required by this AD'', this AD 
requires replacing that text with ``since new (zero total hours 
time-in-service), or since last overhaul if an overhaul has been 
accomplished, or since last inspection and any specified corrective 
action in accordance with the instructions of the ASB if an 
inspection and any specified corrective action by following the 
instructions of the ASB have been accomplished, and thereafter as 
required by this AD''.
    (13) This AD does not adopt the ``Remarks'' section of EASA AD 
2023-0044.

(i) No Reporting Requirement

    Although the material referenced in EASA AD 2023-0044 specifies 
to submit certain information to the manufacturer, this AD does not 
require that action.

(j) Special Flight Permit

    A special flight permit may be issued in accordance with 14 CFR 
21.197 and 21.199 to permit a one-time, non-revenue flight to a 
location where the actions required by this AD can be accomplished. 
This flight must be performed with only essential flight crew.
