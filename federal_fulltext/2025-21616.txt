[OMB 3060-1303; FR ID 319749]


Information Collection Being Submitted for Review and Approval to 
Office of Management and Budget

AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission.

ACTION: Notice and request for comments.

and Budget (OMB) control number. No person shall be subject to any

information collection should be submitted on or before December 31, 
2025.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As part of its continuing effort to reduce 
paperwork burdens, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 
1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), the FCC invited the general public and 
other Federal Agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the 
following information collection. Comments are requested concerning: 
(a) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the 
proper performance of the functions of the Commission, including 
whether the information shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy 
of the Commission's burden estimates; (c) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information collected; and (d) ways to 
minimize the burden of the collection of information on the 
respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology. Pursuant to the Small Business 
Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198, see 44 U.S.C. 
3506(c)(4), the FCC seeks specific comment on how it might further 
reduce the information collection burden for small business concerns 
with fewer than 25 employees.
    OMB Control Number: 3060-1303.
    Title: Advanced Methods to Target and Eliminate Unlawful Robocalls, 
Sixth Report and Order, CG Docket No. 17-59, Authentication Trust 
Anchor, Fifth Report and Order, WC Docket No. 17-97, FCC 22-37.
    Form Number: N/A.
    Type of Review: Extension of a currently approved collection.
    Respondents: Business or other for-profit entities.
    Number of Respondents: 6,493 respondents; 311,664 responses.
    Estimated Time per Response: .25 hours.
    Frequency of Response: On-occasion reporting requirement.
    Obligation to Respond: Required to obtain or retain benefits. 
Statutory *45769 authority for these collections are contained in 
sections 4(i), 4(j), 201, 202, 217, 227, 227b, 251(e), 303(r), and 403 
of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 201,

    Total Annual Burden: 77,916 hours.
    Total Annual Cost: No cost.
    Needs and Uses: This notice and request for comments seeks to 
extend the information collection requirements as it pertains to the 
Advanced Methods to Target and Eliminate Unlawful Robocalls Sixth 
Report and Order and Call Authentication Trust Anchor Fifth Report and 
Order (``Gateway Provider Report and Order''). Unwanted and illegal 
robocalls have long been the Federal Communication Commission's 
(``Commission'') top source of consumer complaints and one of the 
Commission's top consumer protection priorities. Foreign-originated 
robocalls represent a significant portion of illegal robocalls, and 
gateway providers serve as a critical choke-point for reducing the 
number of illegal robocalls received by American consumers. In the 
Gateway Provider Report and Order, the Commission took steps to prevent 
these foreign-originated illegal robocalls from reaching consumers and 
to help track these calls

back to the source. Along with further extension of the Commission's 
caller ID authentication requirements and Robocall Mitigation Database 
filing requirements, the Commission adopted several robocall mitigation 
requirements, including a requirement for gateway providers to respond 
to traceback within 24 hours, mandatory blocking requirements, a ``know 
your upstream provider'' requirement, and a general mitigation 
requirement.

Gateway Provider Report and Order, FCC 22-37, Paras. 65-71, 47 CFR 
64.1200(n)(1)

    A voice service provider must: . . . Upon receipt of a traceback 
request from the Commission, civil law enforcement, criminal law 
enforcement, or the industry traceback consortium:
    (i) If the provider is an originating, terminating, or non-gateway 
intermediate provider for all calls specified in the traceback request, 
the provider must respond fully and in a timely manner;
    (ii) If the provider receiving a traceback request is the gateway 
provider for any calls specified in the traceback request, the provider 
must fully respond to the traceback request within 24 hours of receipt 
of the request. The 24-hour clock does not start outside of business 
hours, and requests received during that time are deemed received at 
8:00 a.m. on the next business day. If the 24-hour response period 
would end on a non-business day, either a weekend or a federal legal 
holiday, the 24-hour clock does not run for the weekend or holiday in 
question, and restarts at 12:01 a.m. on the next business day following 
when the request would otherwise be due. For example, a request 
received at 3:00 p.m. on a Friday will be due at 3:00 p.m. on the 
following Monday, assuming that Monday is not a federal legal holiday. 
For purposes of this rule, ``business day'' is defined as Monday 
through Friday, excluding federal legal holidays, and ``business 
hours'' is defined as 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on a business day. For 
purposes of this rule, all times are local time for the office that is 
required to respond to the request.
    The first portion of the information collection for which OMB 
approval is sought comes from the requirement adopted in the Gateway 
Provider Report and Order that all voice service providers respond to 
traceback ``fully and in in a timely manner'' and gateway providers 
must respond within 24 hours. All voice service providers, including 
gateway providers are required to respond to traceback requests from 
the Commission, civil and criminal law enforcement, and the Industry 
Traceback Consortium. Traceback is a key enforcement tool in the fight 
against illegal calls, allowing the Commission or law enforcement to 
identify the caller and bring enforcement actions or otherwise stop 
future calls before they reach consumers. Any unnecessary delay in the 
process can increase the risk that this essential information may 
become impossible to obtain. While traceback is not a new process, some 
providers have historically been reluctant to respond, or have simply 
ignored requests. This requirement ensures that all providers are on 
notice that a response is required, and allows real consequences for 
refusal.
