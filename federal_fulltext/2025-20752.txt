SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), 
Federal agencies must obtain approval from the OMB for each collection 
of information that they conduct or sponsor. ``Collection of 
information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) to 
include agency requests or requirements, imposed on ten or more 
persons, that members of the public submit reports, keep records, or 
provide information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of title 44 
generally requires Federal agencies to provide a 60-day notice in the 
Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, 
including each proposed extension of an existing collection of 
information, before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, the OCC is publishing notice of the 
renewal of this collection.
    Title: Stress Testing Rules for National Banks and Federal Savings 
Associations.
    OMB Control No.: 1557-0343.
    Type of Review: Regular.
    Affected Public: Businesses or other for-profit.
    Description: The Annual Stress Test rule \1\ implemented Section 
165(i) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
\2\ (``Dodd-Frank Act'') which requires certain companies to conduct 
stress tests. As enacted by the Dodd-Frank Act, national banks and 
Federal savings associations with total consolidated assets of more 
than $10 billion were required to conduct annual stress tests and 
comply with reporting and disclosure requirements under the rule. The 
reporting templates for institutions with total consolidated assets of 
over $50 billion were finalized in 2012.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 77 FR 61238 (October 9, 2012) (codified at 12 CFR part 46).
    \2\ Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 
Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010).
    \3\ 77 FR 49485 (August 16, 2012); 77 FR 66663 (November 6, 
2012).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires certain financial 
companies, including national banks and Federal savings associations, 
to conduct annual stress tests \4\ and requires the primary financial 
regulatory agency \5\ of those financial companies to issue regulations 
implementing the stress test requirements.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ 12 U.S.C. 5365(i)(2)(A).
    \5\ 12 U.S.C. 5301 (12).
    \6\ 12 U.S.C. 5365(i)(2)(C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under section 165(i)(2), a covered institution was required to 
submit to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) 
and to its primary financial regulatory agency a report at such time, 
in such form, and containing such information as the primary financial 
regulatory agency may require.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 12 U.S.C. 5365(i)(2)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act 
(EGRRCPA), enacted on May 24, 2018, amended certain aspects of the 
company-run stress testing requirement in section 165(i)(2) of the 
Dodd-Frank Act.\8\ Specifically, section 401 of EGRRCPA raises the 
minimum asset threshold for financial companies covered by the company-
run stress testing requirement from $10 billion to $250 billion in 
total consolidated assets; revises the requirement for banks to conduct 
stress tests ``annually'' and instead requires them to conduct stress 
tests ``periodically''; and no longer requires the OCC to provide an 
``adverse'' stress-testing scenario, thus reducing the number of 
required stress test scenarios from three to two.
