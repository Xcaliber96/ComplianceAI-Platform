    VA PRA information: Dorothy Glasgow, 202-461-1084, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#095f48595b48497f68276e667f"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b3e5f2e3e1f2f3c5d29dd4dcc5">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Under the PRA of 1995, Federal agencies 
must obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for 
each collection of information they conduct or sponsor. This request 
for comment is being made pursuant to Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA.
    With respect to the following collection of information, VBA 
invites comments on: (1) whether the proposed collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance of VBA's functions, including 
whether the information will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy 
of VBA's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of 
information; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of 
the collection of information on respondents, including through the use 
of automated collection techniques or the use of other forms of 
information technology.
    Title: Request for Details of Expenses.
    OMB Control Number: 2900-0138 <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRASearch">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRASearch</a>.
    Type of Review: Extension without change of a currently approved 
collection.
    Abstract: The primary use of the form is to gather the necessary 
information to determine eligibility for VA Pension. Without VA Form 
21P-8049, VA will not be able to properly evaluate the totality of a 
claimant's circumstances when considering an application for benefits. 
VA will also be unable to assess the totality of the claimant's 
circumstances when VA receives evidence of a significant increase in 
the corpus of the claimant's estate. The collection is conducted on a 
one-time basis and cannot be performed less frequently.
    Affected Public: Individuals and households.
    Estimated Annual Burden: 218 hours.
    Estimated Average Burden per Respondent: 15 minutes.
    Frequency of Response: One time.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 871 per year.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

Acting, VA PRA Clearance Officer, Office of Information Technology/Data
