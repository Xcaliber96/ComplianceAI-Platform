Center for Devices and Radiological Health Appeals Processes

OMB Control Number 0910-0738--Revision

    This information collection supports implementation of 
recommendations found in FDA guidance. As discussed in the document 
entitled ``Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration 
Staff; Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Appeals 
Processes'' (March 2022), there

[[Page 54696]]

are various processes by which appeals requests regarding review of 
decisions or actions by CDRH may be submitted to the Agency. The 
guidance is available for download from our website at <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/center-devices-and-radiological-health-cdrh-appeals-processes">https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/center-devices-and-radiological-health-cdrh-appeals-processes</a>. The 
guidance document provides general format and content recommendations 
in this regard, discusses applicable regulations with regard to the 
timing of such submissions, and describes the collection of information 
not expressly specified under existing regulations such as the 
submission of the request for review, minor clarifications as part of 
the request, and supporting information. While CDRH already possesses 
in the administrative file the information that would form the basis of 
a decision on a matter under appeal, the submission of information as 
recommended in the guidance regarding the appeal request itself, as 
well as data and information relied on by the requestor in the appeal, 
will help facilitate timely resolution of the decision under review. We 
are accounting for burden respondents may incur as a result of these 
Agency recommendations in this collection request. Additional 
information about the CDRH appeals process is described in the 
companion guidance entitled ``Center for Devices and Radiological 
Health (CDRH) Appeals Processes: Questions and Answers About 517A--
Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'' (March 
2020), also available for download from our website at <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/center-devices-and-radiological-health-cdrh-appeals-processes">https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/center-devices-and-radiological-health-cdrh-appeals-processes</a>-

    In the Federal Register of July 3, 2025 (90 FR 29563), FDA 
published a 60-day notice requesting public comment on the proposed 
collection of information. No comments were received.
    FDA estimates the burden of this collection of information as 
follows:

                                                     Table 1--Estimated Annual Reporting Burden \1\

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs associated with this collection of information.

    Our estimated burden for the information collection reflects an 
overall increase of 320 hours and a corresponding increase of 40 
responses. We attribute this adjustment to an increase in the number of 
submissions we received over the last few years. A review of prior 
renewals revealed that additional information about the CDRH appeals 
process is described in the companion guidance entitled ``Center for 
Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Appeals Processes: Questions and 
Answers About 517A--Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug 
Administration Staff'' (March 2020) was omitted in the last approval 
cycle. This current revision adds this missing guidance to provide 
clarity and ensure completeness. No other changes affect the scope or 
burden of this information collection.

Associate Commissioner for Legislation.
