Amendment 39-23167; AD 2025-20-14]
RIN 2120-AA64


Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-26-
03, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 757-200 series 
airplanes. AD 2018-26-03 required, for the Captain's and First 
Officer's seats, repetitive horizontal actuator identifications, 
repetitive checks of the horizontal movement system (HMS), a detailed 
inspection of the HMS, as applicable, and applicable on-condition 
actions. AD 2018-26-03 also required a general visual inspection to 
determine the seat part numbers of the Captain's and First Officer's 
seats, a cable adjustment check on seats with certain seat part 
numbers, and applicable on-condition actions. This AD was prompted by 
reports of uncommanded movement of the Captain's and First Officer's 
seats. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2018-26-03 and adds an 
inspection for previously omitted part numbers. The FAA is issuing this 
AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

DATES: This AD is effective January 2, 2026.
    The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by 
reference of certain publications listed in this AD as of January 2, 
2026.
    The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by 
reference of a certain other publication listed in this AD as of 
January 31, 2019 (83 FR 66612, December 27, 2018).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 
CFR part 39 to supersede AD 2018-26-03, Amendment 39-19533 (83 FR 
66612, December 27, 2018) (AD 2018-26-03). AD 2018-26-03 applied to all 
The Boeing Company Model 757-200 series airplanes. The NPRM was 
published in the Federal Register on March 31, 2025 (90 FR 14213). The 
NPRM was prompted by reports of uncommanded movement of the Captain's 
and First Officer's seats and the determination that additional seats 
are affected by the unsafe condition. In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to 
continue to require the actions in AD 2018-26-03 and add an inspection 
for previously omitted part numbers. The FAA is issuing this AD to 
address uncommanded movement of the Captain's and First Officer's seat, 
which could lead to reduced controllability of the airplane.

Discussion of Final Airworthiness Directive

Comments

    The FAA received comments from the Air Line Pilots Association, 
International and ProTech Aero Services Limited who supported the NPRM 
without change.
    The FAA also received comments from Boeing, Delta Air Lines 
(Delta), and an anonymous commenter. The following presents those 
comments and the FAA's response.

Request To Clarify Seat Applicability for Acceptable Conditions for 
Compliance

    Delta requested the FAA revise paragraph (m) of the proposed AD to 
clarify that it applies to an Ipeco Captain's or First Officer's seat 
currently installed on an airplane. Delta stated that paragraph (m) of 
the proposed AD could be interpreted as applying to all seats currently 
installed on an airplane, or seats that were previously modified as 
required by AD 2018-26-03.
    The FAA agrees with the commenter's rationale and has revised 
paragraph (m) of this AD to specify the paragraph applies to seats 
installed on an airplane.

Request To Revise the Acceptable Conditions for Compliance

    Boeing requested the FAA revise paragraph (m) of this AD to state 
that, if airplane records show an Ipeco Captain's or First Officer's 
seat meets either one of two conditions for Boeing Special Attention 
Service Bulletin 757-25-0308 in table 1 to paragraph (m) of the 
proposed AD, then the actions in paragraphs (g) and (h), as applicable, 
of the proposed AD are not required for that seat; and if the records 
show that a seat meets either one of two conditions for Boeing Special 
Attention Service Bulletin 757-25-0309 in table 1 to paragraph (m) of 
the proposed AD, then the actions in paragraphs (j) and (k), as 
applicable, of the proposed AD are not required for that seat. Boeing 
stated this change would clarify that accomplishment of either Boeing 
Special Attention Service Bulletin 757-25-0308 or 757-25-0309 alone 
does not alleviate both adverse conditions of the seats, and that 
actions in both service bulletins are necessary. Boeing also stated 
that one row for Boeing Special Attention Service Bulletin 757-25-0308 
must be completed for the HMS issue to satisfy the requirements of 
paragraphs (g) and (j) of the proposed AD, and one row must be 
completed for Boeing Special Attention Service Bulletin 757-25-0309 to 
satisfy the requirements of

[[Page 54564]]

paragraphs (h) and (k) of the proposed AD.
    The FAA agrees with the intent of the commenter's request and has 
revised paragraph (m) of this AD to match the language the FAA adopted 
in other ADs that address the same unsafe condition on other Boeing 
airplane models. Paragraph (m) of this AD states, in part, if airplane 
records show a seat installed on an airplane meets the conditions in 
any of the three rows for Boeing Special Attention Service Bulletin 
757-25-0308 in table 1 to paragraph (m) of this AD, then the actions in 
paragraphs (g) and (j), as applicable, of this AD are not required for 
that seat; and if the airplane records show a seat installed on an 
airplane meets the conditions in any of the three rows for Boeing 
Special Attention Service Bulletin 757-25-0309 in table 1 to paragraph 
(m) of this AD, then the actions specified in paragraphs (j) and (k), 
as applicable, of this AD are not required for that seat.

Request To Correct Service Bulletin Reference

    Boeing and Delta requested that the FAA correct three references to 
service bulletin number ``777-25-0309'' in table 1 to paragraph (m) of 
the proposed AD. The commenters stated the correct reference is Boeing 
Special Attention Service Bulletin 757-25-0309.
    The FAA agrees and has revised table 1 to paragraph (m) of this AD 
accordingly.

Request To Add Service Information as Acceptable Conditions for 
Compliance

    Delta requested that the FAA add Ipeco Service Bulletin 258-25-16, 
Issue 4, dated September 11, 2017; and Issue 5, dated April 29, 2020, 
to table 1 to paragraph (m) of the proposed AD. Delta stated that these 
service bulletins embody the HMS inspection and overhaul of the 
Captain's and First Officer's seats. Delta noted that, under the 
proposed table, compliance is acceptable (i.e., the actions specified 
in paragraphs (g), (h), (j), and (k) of the proposed AD are not 
required) if actions are done in accordance with Boeing Special 
Attention Service Bulletin 757-25-0308, Revision 1, dated June 7, 2018, 
and additional actions are done in accordance with Ipeco Service 
Bulletin 258-25-15, Issue 4, dated February 16, 2018; Issue 5, dated 
April 29, 2020; or Issue 6, dated November 1, 2021, for Ipeco part 
number (P/N) 3A258-0007-01-1 or 3A258-0008-01-1 with horizontal 
actuator Artus P/N AD8650503 at ``Amendment C'' or later. Delta also 
noted that Revision 1 of Boeing Special Attention Service Bulletin 757-
25-0308, and Revision 2, dated June 12, 2023, allow accomplishment of 
Issue 4 of Ipeco Service Bulletin 258-25-16 for Ipeco P/N 3A258-0007-
01-1 or 3A258-0008-01-1. Delta stated that accomplishing Issue 4, 5, or 
6 of Ipeco Service Bulletin 258-25-15 triggers repetitive inspections 
of the seats but accomplishing Issue 4 or 5 of Ipeco Service Bulletin 
258-25-16 terminates those repetitive inspections.
    The FAA agrees with the commenter's request for the reasons 
provided above. Accordingly, the FAA has included the additional 
service information in table 1 to paragraph (m) of this AD.

Request To Emphasize Whistleblower Protections

    An anonymous commenter stated the proposed AD should explicitly 
remind operators of the strong whistleblower protections with anti-
retaliatory safeguards for mechanics, flightcrews, and inspectors who 
report recurring or unresolved seat movement issues.
    The FAA acknowledges the commenter's concern. The Wendell H. Ford 
Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (49 U.S.C. 
42121) prohibits discrimination against employees of the U.S. air 
carrier industry and U.S. manufacturers who report information related 
to air carrier safety. Employees of U.S. air carriers and U.S. 
aircraft/component manufacturers, their contractors, and their sub-
contractors are covered under the AIR-21 Whistleblower Protection 
Program. More information about this program is available at <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/whistleblower">https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/whistleblower</a>. Other individuals may a 
file a complaint or safety report using the FAA Hotline. More 
information about this program is available at <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/aae/programs_services/faa_hotlines">https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/aae/programs_services/faa_hotlines</a>. No change to the AD is necessary in this regard.

Request To Consider Impacts on Small Businesses and Communities

    An anonymous commenter requested that the FAA analyze whether 
additional costs or delays from the proposed AD would 
disproportionately affect small operators, regional airlines, or routes 
serving low-income or rural communities. The commenter stated that 
technical support or grants may be needed to avoid reducing affordable 
and equitable access to air service.
    The FAA acknowledges the commenter's concern. The FAA recognizes 
that this AD imposes certain operational costs on operators, and that 
operators have an obligation to maintain their airplanes in airworthy 
condition. However, the FAA does not provide economic mitigation to 
small or large operators. Under certain circumstances, an airplane 
manufacturer might provide warranty coverage, but the FAA does not have 
the authority to require manufacturers to do so. The FAA has not 
changed the AD in this regard.

Request To Require Reporting

    An anonymous commenter requested that the FAA require operators to 
report anonymized data on all incidents of uncommanded seat movement, 
repairs performed, and root causes, with public summaries released 
regularly. The commenter stated that this transparency would build 
trust and allow independent safety and labor advocates to monitor 
implementation.
    The FAA agrees. The holder of a type certificate, parts 
manufacturer approval (PMA), or technical standard order (TSO) 
authorization is required, under 14 CFR 21.3, to report any failure, 
malfunction, or defect in any product or article manufactured by it 
that has resulted in occurrences, as provided in Sec.  21.3(c). These 
reports can be submitted to the service difficulty reporting (SDR) 
system at <a href="http://sdrs.faa.gov">sdrs.faa.gov</a>, which is accessible to the public. No change to 
the AD is necessary in this regard.

Request To Address Safety and Accessibility for Disabled Passengers

    An anonymous commenter requested that the FAA revise the proposed 
AD to require that any new or retrofitted seat meet or exceed the 
American with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessibility requirements for 
disabled passengers and crew members.
    The FAA acknowledges the commenter's concern. The requirements of 
this AD address uncommanded movement of the Captain's and First 
Officer's seats, which could lead to reduced controllability of the 
airplane. Therefore, this AD does not affect disabled passengers or 
cabin crewmembers. If a modification to a seat is needed to accommodate 
a disabled flightcrew member, and the modification affects compliance 
with this AD, an operator may request approval of an alternative method 
of compliance (AMOC) under the provisions of paragraph (n) of this AD. 
The FAA has not revised the AD in this regard.

Request To Address Compliance Time and Workforce Capacity

    An anonymous commenter requested the FAA confirm that the proposed 
compliance time would not result in overburdening maintenance staff, 
forced

[[Page 54565]]

overtime, or flight cancellations. The commenter stated that rushed or 
under-resourced implementation of an AD risks maintenance errors and 
fatigue.
    The FAA acknowledges the commenter's concern. In developing an 
appropriate compliance time for this AD, the FAA considered the 
recommendations of the manufacturer, the urgency associated with the 
subject unsafe condition, the availability of required parts, and the 
practical aspect of accomplishing the required modification within a 
period of time that corresponds to the normal scheduled maintenance for 
most affected operators. In consideration of these items, the FAA has 
determined that the compliance time required by this AD will ensure an 
acceptable level of safety. However, under the provisions of paragraph 
(n) of this AD, the FAA will consider requests for approval of an 
extension of the compliance time if sufficient data are submitted to 
substantiate that the new compliance time would provide an acceptable 
level of safety. The FAA has not changed this AD in this regard.

Request To Include Stakeholder Input

    An anonymous commenter requested that the FAA require meaningful 
input from frontline mechanics, labor unions, flightcrew 
representatives, and disability rights groups before finalizing 
compliance plans or altering seat design standards.
    The FAA acknowledges the commenter's concern. The FAA provides 
industry stakeholders the opportunity to participate in the rulemaking 
process by providing notice in the Federal Register. Before issuing the 
final rule, the FAA considers all comments received and determines 
whether air safety requires incorporating any requested changes or 
adopting the AD as proposed. No change to the AD is necessary in this 
regard.

Request To Address Environmental Impacts

    An anonymous commenter requested that the FAA revise the proposed 
AD to clarify the environmental impact of seat replacement or repairs, 
including discarded parts and whether materials are reused or recycled. 
The commenter asserted that the FAA should prioritize sustainable 
disposal and recycling practices.
    The FAA disagrees with the request. In accordance with 14 CFR 39.5, 
the FAA issues an AD when an unsafe condition exists on an aircraft, 
aircraft engine, propellers, or appliances, and the condition is likely 
to exist or develop in other products of the same type design. 
Mandating how operators dispose of parts removed from an airplane or 
their spares inventory does not address the unsafe condition. Further, 
according to Sec.  39.11, an AD specifies the actions that must be 
taken to resolve the unsafe condition. Any actions required beyond that 
may create an unnecessary burden on operators. The FAA has not revised 
the AD in this regard.

Request To Address Worker Safety

    An anonymous commenter requested that the FAA revise the proposed 
AD to require robust reporting, training, and oversight to protect 
maintenance workers who inspect and repair the affected seats. The 
commenter stated seat maintenance can involve awkward and hazardous 
positions, and the FAA should ensure that airlines are required to 
provide safe working conditions, ergonomic equipment, and paid time for 
proper safety procedures.
    The FAA disagrees with revising the AD. As stated previously, the 
FAA issues an AD to require the necessary actions to adequately address 
an unsafe condition on an affected product. The safety and protection 
of maintenance workers is outside the scope of this AD. The FAA has not 
revised the AD in this regard.

Request To Consider Labor Rights

    An anonymous commenter asked if the FAA has a plan to monitor and 
enforce labor standards and fair working conditions in the 
manufacturing and supply chain for replacement of seat parts. The 
commenter stated that the proposed AD should not create pressure to 
outsource work to low-wage and -rights facilities.
    The FAA does not plan to monitor or enforce labor standards and 
working conditions related to the production and supply of replacement 
seat parts. The enforcement of labor standards and fair working 
conditions is outside the scope of this AD. As stated previously, the 
FAA issues an AD to require the necessary actions to adequately address 
an unsafe condition on an affected product. The FAA has not changed the 
AD in this regard.

Request To Address Airline Cost Pass-Through

    An anonymous commenter asked what measures the FAA will take to 
prevent airlines from passing on AD compliance costs directly to 
passengers through fare increases or fees, which disproportionately 
burden working-class travelers.
    The FAA acknowledges the commenter's concern. As stated previously, 
the FAA issues an AD to require the necessary actions to adequately 
address an unsafe condition on an affected product. The FAA's authority 
to regulate air safety does not include prescribing how a private 
company conducts its business. The FAA has not changed the AD in this 
regard.

Conclusion

    The FAA reviewed the relevant data, considered any comments 
received, and determined that air safety requires adopting this AD as 
proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe 
condition on these products. Except for the foregoing changes, this AD 
is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. None of the changes will increase 
the economic burden on any operator.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed Boeing Special Attention Service Bulletin 757-25-
0308, Revision 2, dated June 12, 2023. This material specifies 
procedures for repetitive horizontal actuator identifications, 
repetitive checks of the HMS, a detailed inspection of the HMS, as 
applicable, and applicable on-condition actions including an overhaul 
and checks of the HMS, with the option to install a serviceable seat 
under certain conditions, which terminates the repetitive checks.
    The FAA reviewed Boeing Special Attention Service Bulletin 757-25-
0309, Revision 2, dated June 12, 2023. This material specifies 
procedures for a general visual inspection to determine the seat part 
numbers on the Captain's and First Officer's seats, and, for seats with 
certain part numbers, a manual override cable adjustment check of the 
Captain's and First Officer's seats, and applicable on-condition 
actions including moving the adjustment nut, tightening the lock nut, 
and readjusting the control lever.
    This AD also requires Boeing Special Attention Service Bulletin 
757-25-0308, Revision 1, dated June 7, 2018, which the Director of the 
Federal Register approved for incorporation by reference as of January 
31, 2019 (83 FR 66612, December 27, 2018).
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 484 airplanes of U.S. 
registry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Certain configurations of the Captain's and First Officer's seats 
may require special tooling to test the seats. Special tooling for one 
set of Captain's and First Officer's seats will cost $30,000, and a 
certain other set will cost $32,500. If an operator owns both 
combinations of seats, the special tooling will cost up to $62,500 per 
operator.
    We have received no definitive data that would enable us to provide 
the remaining cost estimates for the on-condition actions specified in 
this AD.

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, 
on the relationship between the national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various 
levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

(n) Alternative Methods of Compliance (AMOCs)

    (1) The Manager, AIR-520, Continued Operational Safety Branch, 
FAA, has the authority to approve AMOCs for this AD, if requested 
using the procedures found in 14 CFR 39.19. In accordance with 14 
CFR 39.19, send your request to your principal inspector or 
responsible Flight Standards Office, as appropriate. If sending 
information directly to the manager of the certification office, 
send it to the attention of the person identified in paragraph (o) 
of this AD. Information may be emailed to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5e1f13111d1e383f3f70393128"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="87c6cac8c4c7e1e6e6a9e0e8f1">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Before 
using any approved AMOC, notify your appropriate principal 
inspector, or lacking a principal inspector, the manager of the 
responsible Flight Standards Office.

[[Page 54568]]

    (2) An AMOC that provides an acceptable level of safety may be 
used for any repair, modification, or alteration required by this AD 
if it is approved by The Boeing Company Organization Designation 
Authorization (ODA) that has been authorized by the Manager, AIR-
520, Continued Operational Safety Branch, FAA, to make those 
findings. To be approved, the repair method, modification deviation, 
or alteration deviation must meet the certification basis of the 
airplane, and the approval must specifically refer to this AD.
    (3) AMOCs approved for AD 2018-26-03 are approved as AMOCs for 
the corresponding provisions of this AD.
    (4) For material that contains steps that are labeled as 
Required for Compliance (RC), the provisions of paragraphs (n)(4)(i) 
and (ii) of this AD apply.
    (i) The steps labeled as RC, including substeps under an RC step 
and any figures identified in an RC step, must be done to comply 
with the AD. If a step or substep is labeled ``RC Exempt,'' then the 
RC requirement is removed from that step or substep. An AMOC is 
required for any deviations to RC steps, including substeps and 
identified figures.
    (ii) Steps not labeled as RC may be deviated from using accepted 
methods in accordance with the operator's maintenance or inspection 
program without obtaining approval of an AMOC, provided the RC 
steps, including substeps and identified figures, can still be done 
as specified, and the airplane can be put back in an airworthy 
condition.
