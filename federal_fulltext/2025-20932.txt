be collected; and
    (4) Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those

electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or

Overview of This Information Collection

    (1) Type of Information Collection: Revision of a Currently 
Approved Collection.
    (2) Title of the Form/Collection: Student and Exchange Visitor 
Information System (SEVIS).
    (3) Agency form number, if any, and the applicable component of the 
Department of Homeland Security sponsoring the collection: I-17 and I-
20; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
    (4) Affected public who will be asked or required to respond, as 
well as a brief abstract: Primary: Nonprofit institutions and 
individuals or households. SEVIS is an internet-based data entry, 
collection, and reporting system. It collects information on SEVP-
certified schools via the Form I-17, ``Petition for Approval of School 
for Attendance by Nonimmigrant Student,'' and collects information on 
the F and M nonimmigrant students that the SEVP-certified schools admit 
into their programs of study via the Form I-20, ``Certificate of 
Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status--For Academic and 
Language Students'' and ``Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant 
(M-1) Student Status--For Vocational Students.''
    The Form I-17 will be revised to collect previous school codes 
associated with the school and/or owner, school website links, 
emergency contact information for the school, and additional 
information on school ownership, as well as to remove the fax number 
field, which is now obsolete. SEVP will be redesigning the ``Program of 
Study'' page on the Form I-17 to better capture the educational level, 
degree, program of study, time necessary to complete the program, 
assigned Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code, and mode 
of instruction. In addition, SEVP will require schools to indicate 
whether a program of study is conducted predominantly online or in a 
hybrid or low residency format and whether Curricular Practical 
Training is a component of a program of study. Other updates to the 
Form I-17 will allow designated school officials (DSOs) to select 
``weeks'' as an academic term length, require DSOs to provide separate 
numbers for domestic and international students when listing the 
``Average Annual Number of Students,'' allow DSOs to list annual costs 
by program of study or degree level, allow DSOs to provide additional 
contact information, require DSOs to indicate whether they work full-
time or part-time, and change a DSO's ``Title'' to ``Job Title,'' to 
better collect information on their position at the school.
    The Form I-20 will be revised to collect contact and other 
information on legal guardians of minor F and M students, the date of 
students' graduation/degree awarded, and clarifying details on the 
source and type of the financial support for F and M students, as well 
as information to indicate whether a student is engaging in online 
education or on-campus employment. Information will also be collected 
on whether a student's employment or training is being conducted at an 
on-site location or remotely.
    (5) An estimate of the total number of respondents and the amount 
of time estimated for an average respondent to respond: 20,890 
responses.
    (6) An estimate of the total public burden (in hours) associated 
with the collection: The total estimated annual burden associated with 
this collection of information in hours is 815,505 hours. There is an 
additional one-time burden in the first year of this collection of 
6,778 hours.
