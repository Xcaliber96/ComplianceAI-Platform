SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520, and its 
implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, require Federal agencies to 
issue two notices seeking public comment on information collection 
activities before OMB may approve paperwork packages. See 44 U.S.C. 
3506, 3507; 5 CFR 1320.8 through 1320.12. On August 8, 2025, FRA 
published a 60-day notice in the Federal Register soliciting public 
comment on the ICR for which it is now seeking OMB approval. See 90 FR 
38585. FRA has received no comments related to the proposed collection 
of information.
    Before OMB decides whether to approve this proposed collection of 
information, it must provide 30 days' notice for public comment. 
Federal law requires OMB to approve or disapprove paperwork packages 
between 30 and 60 days after the 30-day notice is published. 44 U.S.C. 
3507(b) and (c); 5 CFR 1320.12(d); see also 60 FR 44978, 44983 (Aug. 
29, 1995). The 30-day notice informs the regulated community of their 
opportunity to file relevant comments and affords the agency adequate 
time to consider public comments before it renders a decision. 60 FR 
44983 (Aug. 29, 1995). Therefore, respondents should submit their 
respective comments to OMB within 30 days of publication to best ensure 
having their full effect.
    Comments are invited on the following ICR regarding: (1) whether 
the information collection activities are necessary for FRA to properly 
execute its functions, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (2) the accuracy of FRA's estimates of the burden of 
the information collection activities, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used to determine the estimates; (3) ways 
for FRA to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
being collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of information 
collection activities on the public, including the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology.
    The summary below describes the ICR that FRA will submit for OMB 
clearance as the PRA requires:
    Title: State Safety Participation Program and Reporting of Remedial 
Actions.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ In this 30-day notice, FRA has corrected the title of the 
information collection document. In the published 60-day notice, 90 
FR 38585, the title is shown as State Safety Participation 
Regulations and Reporting of Remedial Actions. FRA has corrected the 
title in this 30-day notice to reflect the current title in the OMB 
inventory as State Safety Participation Program and Reporting of 
Remedial Actions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    OMB Control Number: 2130-0509.
    Abstract: Title 49 CFR part 212 requires qualified State inspectors 
to provide various reports to FRA for monitoring and enforcement 
purposes concerning State investigative, inspection, and surveillance 
activities related to railroad compliance with Federal railroad safety 
laws and regulations. Additionally, under 49 CFR part 209, subpart E, 
railroads are required to report to FRA actions taken to remedy certain 
alleged violations of law.

estimates) of a currently approved collection.

number.
