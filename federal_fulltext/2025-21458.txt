substitutes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    In FR Doc. 2025-19787 of November 5, 2025, the CY 2026 PFS final 
rule (90 FR 49266), there were technical errors that are identified in 
this correcting document.

II. Summary of Errors

    On pages 49493, 49496, 49501, 49504, and 49506 through 49509, we 
inadvertently made typographical and technical errors in our discussion 
of the payment for skin substitutes.

III. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking and Delay in Effective Date

    Section 1871(b)(1) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires 
the Secretary to provide for notice of a proposed rule in the Federal 
Register and provide a period of not less than 60 days for public 
comment. In addition, section 1871(e)(1)(B)(i) of the Act mandates a 
30-day delay in effective date after issuance or publication of a rule. 
Section 1871(b)(2)(C) of the Act provides an exception from the notice 
and 60-day comment period and delay in effective date requirements of 
the Act, under the good cause standard set forth in 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). 
Section 1871(e)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act provides an exception from the 
delay in effective date requirements of the Act as well. Section 
553(b)(B) authorizes an agency to dispense with normal notice and 
comment rulemaking procedures for good cause if the agency makes a 
finding that the notice and comment process is impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and includes a 
statement of the finding and the reasons for it in the rule. In 
addition, section 1871(e)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act allows the agency to 
avoid the 30-day delay in effective date where the waiver is necessary 
to comply with statutory requirements or such delay is contrary to the 
public interest and the agency includes in the rule a statement of the 
finding and the reasons for it.
    In our view, this correcting document does not constitute a 
rulemaking that would be subject to these requirements. This document 
merely corrects technical and typographical errors in the payment for 
skin substitutes provisions of the CY 2026 PFS final rule. The 
corrections contained in this document are consistent with, and do not 
make substantive changes to, the policies and payment methodologies 
that were proposed, subject to notice and comment procedures, and 
adopted in the CY 2026 PFS final rule. As a result, the corrections 
made through this document are intended to resolve inadvertent errors 
in the discussion of the skin substitutes policies so that the CY 2026 
PFS final rule accurately reflects the policies adopted therein.
    In addition, even if this were a rulemaking to which the notice and 
comment and delayed effective date requirements applied, we find that 
there is good cause to waive such requirements. Undertaking further 
notice and comment procedures to incorporate the corrections in this 
document into the CY 2026 PFS final rule or delaying the effective date 
of the corrections are unnecessary because we are not making any 
substantive revisions to the CY 2026 PFS final rule, but rather, we are 
simply correcting the Federal Register documents to reflect the skin 
substitutes policies that we previously proposed, received public 
comment on, and subsequently finalized in the CY 2026 PFS final rule. 
Further comment is not needed to inform our decision to rectify the 
ministerial errors noted in this final rule and correction. For these 
reasons, we believe there is good cause to waive notice and comment and 
delay in effective date, even if they were required.
