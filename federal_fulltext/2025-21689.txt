Medical Gases--Current Good Manufacturing Practice; Draft 
Guidance for Industry; Availability

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Notice of availability.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is 
announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled 
``Medical Gases--Current Good Manufacturing Practice.'' This guidance 
is intended to assist manufacturers of medical gases in complying with 
regulations for current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) that become 
effective on December 18, 2025 (note, the conforming amendments to the 
CGMP requirements for combination products became effective February 2, 
2026). These regulations are

[[Page 55132]]

specific to medical gases for human and animal use and, like all CGMP 
requirements, contain the minimum requirements to ensure that 
manufacturing processes operate under a state of control to meet 
prespecified quality standards for identity, strength, quality, and 
purity, but are tailored more narrowly to how medical gases are 
manufactured, packaged, labeled, stored, and distributed. This draft 
guidance is being issued to reflect new and revised regulations in 
several areas to reduce the regulatory burden, as appropriate, for the 
medical gas industry. This draft guidance revises and replaces the 
draft guidance entitled ``Current Good Manufacturing Practice for 
Medical Gases'' issued in June 2017.

DATES: Submit either electronic or written comments on the draft 
guidance by January 30, 2026 to ensure that the Agency considers your 
comment on this draft guidance before it begins work on the final 
version of the guidance.

ADDRESSES: You may submit comments on any guidance at any time as 
follows:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background

    FDA is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry 
entitled ``Medical Gases--Current Good Manufacturing Practice.'' This 
guidance revises and replaces the draft guidance issued on June 29, 
2017, entitled ``Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Medical 
Gases'' (82 FR 29565), which described how medical gas manufacturers 
could comply with applicable requirements in the general drug CGMP 
regulations under parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211).
    ``Medical gas'' is defined in section 575(2) of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360ddd(2)) as a drug that 
is manufactured or stored in a liquefied, nonliquefied, or cryogenic 
state and administered as a gas. Medical gases include ``designated 
medical gases'' (DMGs) as defined in section 575(1) of the FD&C Act; 
medically appropriate combinations of DMGs; medical gases marketed 
under applications submitted under sections 505 (21 U.S.C. 355) or 512 
(21 U.S.C. 360b) of the FD&C Act; and any marketed unapproved drugs 
that are medical gases.
    On June 18, 2024, FDA issued a final rule (89 FR 51738) that 
established requirements more specifically tailored to medical gases to 
better address the unique characteristics of these drugs. The final 
rule was intended to reduce the regulatory burden, as appropriate, for 
the medical gas industry. This deregulatory effort addressed several 
areas in which either new regulations

[[Page 55133]]

were needed, or existing regulations required revision because they 
were not well-suited for medical gases. One area where new regulations 
were established was CGMP.
    Prior to implementation of the final rule, medical gas 
manufacturers were subject to the general drug CGMP regulations for 
finished pharmaceutical under parts 210 and 211, but these regulations 
did not account for differences in how medical gases are manufactured 
compared to other drugs. Notably, medical gases are generally 
manufactured in a closed, sealed pressurized system; are not expected 
to expire or degrade under ordinary storage conditions; and are 
contained in cylinders that are reused many times. In addition, medical 
gas manufacturing involves entities downstream of the original gas 
manufacturer who further manufacture, process, pack, or hold medical 
gases. Mix-ups or the accidental use of rejected or quarantined product 
generally pose more of a risk to patient safety than does 
contamination.
    Because of these differences, certain requirements in the general 
CGMP regulations under parts 210 and 211 were unnecessary to assure the 
safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity of medical gases (e.g., 
distributing oldest stock first, use of filters, and certain 
requirements for controlling microbial contamination). FDA addressed 
these differences in the June 2017 draft guidance for industry.
    However, those recommendations will no longer be applicable with 
the implementation of the final rule. As of December 18, 2025, medical 
gas manufacturers are subject to medical gas-specific CGMP regulations 
under part 213 (21 CFR part 213) rather than the general CGMP 
regulations under parts 210 and 211 (note, conforming amendments to 
CGMP regulations for combination products are effective February 2, 
2026). The guidance announced in this notice explains how medical gas 
manufacturers can comply with part 213, and includes among its 
recommendations clarification on the following:

<bullet> Ensuring the reliability of a supplier's capabilities
<bullet> Protecting against container closure leaks
<bullet> Appropriate cleaning and maintenance of buildings, facilities, 
and equipment used in medical gas manufacture
<bullet> Prevention of labeling and product mix-ups
<bullet> Circumstances requiring stability testing, expiration testing, 
or both
<bullet> Handling of returned and salvaged medical gases

    This draft guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good 
guidance practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). The draft guidance, when 
finalized, will represent the current thinking of FDA on ``Medical 
Gases--Current Good Manufacturing Practice.'' It does not establish any 
rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can 
use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the 
applicable statutes and regulations.
    As we develop final guidance on this topic, FDA will consider 
comments on costs or cost savings the guidance may generate, relevant 
for Executive Order 14192.

II. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995

    While this guidance contains no collection of information, it does 
refer to previously approved FDA collections of information. The 
previously approved collections of information are subject to review by 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521). The collections of information 
in 21 CFR part 11 relating to electronic records and electronic 
signatures have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0303. The 
collections of information in 21 CFR part 213 relating to current good 
manufacturing practice requirements for medical gases, including 21 CFR 
213.22(d), which states that quality unit activities (such as quality 
agreements with suppliers) and procedures should be in writing, have 
been approved under OMB control number 0910-0906.
