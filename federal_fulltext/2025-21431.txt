Background

    The nationwide shortage of truck parking spaces is a significant 
source of frustration for truck drivers, increasing expenses for the 
trucking industry and decreasing safety for all road users. The 
American Transportation Research Institute conducts an annual survey of 
trucking industry stakeholders (Critical Issues in the Trucking 
Industry), and the 2024 survey found that, for the second year in a 
row, the lack of available truck parking was the second highest 
industry concern overall, and the number one concern among truck 
drivers. The lack of truck parking often forces truck drivers to choose 
between violating federal hours-of-service laws and using unsafe, 
illegal parking spaces.
    Many government, safety, and industry organizations are working to 
create more truck parking spaces, but there is a lack of research on 
the actual precise monetary benefits of new truck parking spaces. These 
benefits include decreasing carriers' costs, increasing drivers' well-
being, and reducing the number of crashes. To help State and local 
policymakers make informed decisions about the construction of truck 
parking spaces, FMCSA is conducting a research study, titled 
Quantifying the Benefits of Creating New Truck Parking Spaces, which 
will survey truck drivers about their parking habits and experiences, 
gaining the exact information needed to quantify the benefits of new 
truck parking spaces.
    Although researchers have conducted many other surveys on truck 
parking, none have reliably estimated the statistics needed, including 
how often and how long truck drivers (a) park in unauthorized spaces, 
(b) stop driving early to obtain a parking space, (c) drive off their 
routes to find parking, and (d) drive past hours-of-service limits to 
find parking. The results of this survey will be combined with related 
research to produce estimates of the benefits of creating new truck 
parking spaces in different areas, which could be beneficial to the 
many government and private organizations that decide where to build 
new truck parking spaces.
    The main objective of this project is to estimate the benefits of 
new truck parking spaces, but the project will also answer four related 
research questions:
    1. How many trucks are parked in authorized and unauthorized areas 
per day, on average? In other words, how large is the nationwide 
shortage of truck parking spaces?
    2. What are the most cost-effective methods for increasing truck 
parking capacity?
    3. Which truck parking information management systems are used most 
often and are most effective?
    4. What percentage of drivers routinely make reservations, pay for 
parking, or use various other truck parking services?
    Several thousand truck drivers, from a wide range of sectors, will 
be asked to complete the 25-minute online survey, with a goal of 
obtaining approximately 1,000 complete responses.
    Title 23, United States Code (U.S.C.), Chapter 4, Section 403 
authorizes the Secretary to use funds appropriated to carry out this 
section to conduct research and development activities, including 
demonstration projects and the collection and analysis of highway and 
motor vehicle safety data and

[[Page 54852]]

related information with respect to all aspects of highway and traffic 
safety systems and conditions relating to vehicle, highway, driver, 
passenger, motorcyclist, bicyclist, and pedestrian characteristics; 
accident causation and investigations; and human behavioral factors and 
their effect on highway and traffic safety, including driver education, 
impaired driving and distracted driving; and research on, evaluations 
of, and identification of best practices related to driver education 
programs (including driver education curricula, instructor training and 
certification, program administration, and delivery mechanisms) and 
make recommendations for harmonizing driver education and multistage 
graduated licensing systems; and the effect of State laws on any 
aspects, activities, or programs described in subparagraphs (A) through 
(E) (see 23 U.S.C. 403(b)(1)(A)(i)-(ii), 23 U.S.C. 403(b)(1)(B)(i)-
(iii), 23 U.S.C. 403(b)(1)(E), 23 U.S.C. 403(b)(1)(F)).
    Title: Quantifying Benefits of Truck Parking.
    OMB Control Number: 2126-00XX.
    Type of Request: New ICR.
    Respondents: Commercial truck drivers.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 1,000.
    Estimated Time per Response: 25 minutes.
    Expiration Date: N/A. This is a new ICR.
    Frequency of Response: Each survey participant will provide only

    Estimated Total Annual Burden: 416 hours (0.416 hours per response 
x 1,000 respondents) at an estimated cost of $15,185.66 ($15.19 per 
respondent x 1,000 respondents).
    Public Comments Invited: You are asked to comment on any aspect of 
this information collection, including: (1) whether the proposed 
collection is necessary for the performance of FMCSA's functions; (2) 
the accuracy of the estimated burden; (3) ways for FMCSA to enhance the 
quality, usefulness, and clarity of the collected information; and (4)

the collected information. The Agency will summarize or include your 
comments in the request for OMB's clearance of this ICR.
