Overview of This Information Collection

    Title: Application for Foreign-Trade Zone Admission and/or Status 
Designation, and Application for Foreign-Trade Zone Activity Permit.
    OMB Number: 1651-0029.
    Form Number: 214, 214A, 214B, 241C, 216.
    Current Actions: Extension without change.
    Type of Review: Extension (without change).
    Affected Public: Businesses.
    Abstract: Foreign trade zones (FTZs) are geographical enclaves 
located within the geographical limits of the United States, but for 
tariff purposes are considered to be outside of the United States. 
Imported merchandise may be brought into FTZs for storage,

[[Page 54355]]

manipulation, manufacture, or other processing and subsequent removal 
for exportation, consumption in the United States, or destruction. A 
company bringing goods into an FTZ has a choice of zone status 
(privileged/non-privileged foreign, domestic, or zone-restricted), 
which affects the way such goods are treated by Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) and treated for tariff purposes upon entry into the 
customs territory of the United States.
    CBP Forms 214, 214A, 214B, and 214C, which make up the Application 
for Foreign-Trade Zone Admission and/or Status Designation, are used by 
companies that bring merchandise, except in certain circumstances 
including, but not limited to, domestic status merchandise, into an FTZ 
to register the admission of such merchandise into FTZs and to apply 
for the appropriate zone status. Form 214A is not filled out separately 
by respondents; it is simply a copy of Form 214 that CBP gives to the 
Census Bureau. Form 214B is a continuation sheet for Form 214 that 
respondents use when they need more room to add line items to the form. 
Form 214C is a continuation sheet for Form 214A that respondents use 
when they need more room to add line items to the form.
    CBP Form 216, Foreign-Trade Zone Activity Permit, is used by 
companies to request approval to manipulate, manufacture, exhibit, or 
destroy merchandise in an FTZ.
    These FTZ forms are authorized by 19 U.S.C. 81 and provided for by 
19 CFR 146.22, 146.32, 146.35, 146.36, 146.37, 146.39, 146.40, 146.41, 
146.44, 146.52, 146.53, and 146.66. These forms are accessible at: 
<a href="http://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/forms">http://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/forms</a>.

community, who are familiar with import procedures and with CBP 
regulations.
