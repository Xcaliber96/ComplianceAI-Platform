SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Public Law 107-296 The Homeland Security Act 
of 2002, Title II, recognizes the Department of Homeland Security's 
role in integrating relevant critical infrastructure and cybersecurity 
information, analyses, and vulnerability assessments (whether such 
information, analyses, or assessments are provided or produced by the 
Department or others) in order to identify priorities for protective 
and support measures by the Department, other agencies of the Federal 
Government, State and local government agencies and authorities, the 
private sector, and other entities while maintaining positive control 
of sensitive information regarding the national infrastructure. In 
support of this mission, CISA Office of the Chief Security Officer 
(OCSO) must maintain a robust visitor screening capability. CISA OCSO 
will collect, using an electronic form, information about each 
potential visitor to CISA facilities and the nature of each visit. CISA 
OCSO will use collected information to make a risk-based decision to 
allow visitor access to CISA facilities. This is an extension of an 
existing information collection.
