SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The CAA added provisions applicable to group 
health plans and health insurance issuers in the group and individual 
markets in a new Part D of title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act 
(PHS Act) and also added new provisions to part 7 of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and Subchapter B of chapter 100 
of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Section 102 of the No Surprises 
Act added Code section 9816, ERISA section 716, and PHS Act section 
2799A-1, which contain limitations on cost sharing and requirements for 
initial payments for emergency services. Section 103 of the No 
Surprises Act amended Code section 9816, ERISA section 716, and PHS Act 
section 2799A-1 to establish a Federal independent dispute resolution 
(Federal IDR) process that nonparticipating providers or facilities and 
group health plans and health insurance issuers in the group and 
individual market may use following the end of an unsuccessful open 
negotiation period to determine the out-of-network rate for certain 
services. More specifically, the Federal IDR provisions may be used to 
determine the out-of-network rate for certain emergency services, 
nonemergency items and services furnished by nonparticipating providers 
at participating health care facilities, where an All-Payer Model 
Agreement or specified state law does not apply. Section 105 of the No 
Surprises Act created Code section 9817, ERISA section 717, and PHS Act 
section 2799A-2 which contain limitations on cost sharing and 
requirements for initial payments for air ambulance services, and allow 
plans and issuers and providers of air ambulance services to access the 
Federal IDR process. CAA provisions that apply to health care providers 
and facilities, and providers of air ambulance services, such as 
requirements around cost sharing, prohibitions on balance billing for 
certain items and services, and requirements related to disclosures 
about balance billing protections, were added to title XXVII of the PHS 
Act in a new part E. For additional substantive information about this 
ICR, see the related notice published in the Federal Register on 
January 6, 2025 (90 FR 671).
    Comments are invited on: (1) whether the collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Department, including whether the information will have practical 
utility; (2) the accuracy of the agency's estimates of the burden and 
cost of the collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility and clarity of the information collection; and (4) ways to 
minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are 
to respond, including the use of automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology.
    This information collection is subject to the PRA. A Federal agency 
generally cannot conduct or sponsor a collection of information, and 
the public is generally not required to respond to an information 
collection, unless the OMB approves it and displays a currently valid 
OMB Control Number. In addition, notwithstanding any other provisions 
of law, no person shall generally be subject to penalty for failing to 
comply with a collection of information that does not display a valid 
OMB Control Number. See 5 CFR 1320.5(a) and 1320.6.
    DOL seeks PRA authorization for this information collection for 
three (3) years. OMB authorization for an ICR cannot be for more than 
three (3) years without renewal. The DOL notes that information 
collection requirements submitted to the OMB for existing ICRs receive 
a month-to-month extension while they undergo review.
    Agency: DOL-EBSA.
    Title of Collection: No Surprises Act: IDR Process.
    OMB Control Number: 1210-0169.
    Affected Public: Private sector.
    Total Estimated Number of Respondents: 2,000,012.
