Information Collections Being Reviewed by the Federal 
Communications Commission Under Delegated Authority

AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission.

ACTION: Notice and request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: 
    As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork burdens, and 
as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) invites the general 
public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment 
on the following information collections. Comments are requested 
concerning: whether the proposed collection of information is necessary 
for the proper performance of the functions of the Commission, 
including whether the information shall have practical utility; the 
accuracy of the Commission's burden estimate; ways to enhance the 
quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; ways to 
minimize the burden of the collection of information on the 
respondents, including the use of automated collection burden on small 
business concerns with fewer than 25 employees.
    The FCC may not conduct or sponsor a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. No person 
shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection 
of information subject to the PRA that does not display a valid OMB 
control number.

DATES: Written PRA comments should be submitted on or before January 
30, 2026. If you anticipate that you will be submitting comments but 
find it difficult to do so within the period of time allowed by this 
notice, you should advise the contact listed below as soon as possible.

ADDRESSES: Direct all PRA comments to Cathy Williams, FCC, via email 
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#abfbf9eaebcdc8c885ccc4dd"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="74242635341217175a131b02">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> and to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#adeeccd9c5d483fac4c1c1c4ccc0deedcbcece83cac2db"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c487a5b0acbdea93ada8a8ada5a9b784a2a7a7eaa3abb2">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

covers at least two weekly periods separated by at least thirty days

samples sufficient to assure that the combined surveys result in an 
average figure at least one standard error above the required viewing

particular broadcast station is eligible for significantly viewed 
status under the Commission's rules. The notifications provide 
interested parties with an opportunity to review survey methodologies 
and file objections.

broadcast stations about the retransmission of significantly viewed 
signals by a satellite carrier into these stations' local market.
