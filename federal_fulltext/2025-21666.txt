SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) publishes a notice listing all HHS-certified laboratories and 
Instrumented Initial Testing Facilities (IITFs) in the Federal Register 
monthly, in accordance with Section 9.19 of the Mandatory Guidelines 
for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (Mandatory Guidelines) 
using Urine and Section 9.17 of the Mandatory Guidelines using Oral 
Fluid. If any laboratory or IITF certification is suspended or revoked, 
the laboratory or IITF will be omitted from subsequent lists until such 
time as it is restored to full certification under the Mandatory 
Guidelines.
    If any laboratory or IITF has withdrawn from the HHS National 
Laboratory Certification Program (NLCP) during the past month, it will 
be listed at the end and will be omitted from the monthly listing 
thereafter.
    This notice is also available on the internet at <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/workplace/drug-testing-resources/certified-lab-list">https://www.samhsa.gov/workplace/drug-testing-resources/certified-lab-list</a>.
    The Mandatory Guidelines using Urine were first published in the 
Federal Register on April 11, 1988 (53 FR 11970), and subsequently 
revised in the Federal Register on June 9, 1994 (59 FR 29908); 
September 30, 1997 (62 FR 51118); April 13, 2004 (69 FR 19644); 
November 25, 2008 (73 FR 71858); December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75122); April 
30, 2010 (75 FR 22809); January 23, 2017 (82 FR 7920); and on October 
12, 2023 (88 FR 70768).
    The Mandatory Guidelines using Oral Fluid were first published in 
the Federal Register on October 25, 2019 (84 FR 57554) with an 
effective date of January 1, 2020, and subsequently revised in the 
Federal Register on October 12, 2023 (88 FR 70814).
    The Mandatory Guidelines were initially developed in accordance 
with Executive Order 12564 and section 503 of Public Law 100-71 and 
allowed urine drug testing only. The Mandatory Guidelines using Urine 
have since been revised, and new Mandatory Guidelines allowing for oral 
fluid drug testing have been published. The Mandatory Guidelines 
require strict standards that laboratories and IITFs must meet in order 
to conduct drug and specimen validity tests on specimens for Federal 
agencies. HHS does not allow IITFs to conduct oral fluid testing.
    To become certified, an applicant laboratory or IITF must undergo 
three rounds of performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To 
maintain that certification, a laboratory or IITF must participate in a 
quarterly performance testing program plus undergo periodic, on-site 
inspections.
    Laboratories and IITFs in the applicant stage of certification are 
not to be considered as meeting the minimum requirements described in 
the HHS Mandatory Guidelines using Urine and/or Oral Fluid. An HHS-
certified laboratory or IITF must have its letter of certification from 
HHS/SAMHSA (formerly: HHS/NIDA), which attests that the test facility 
has met minimum standards.
