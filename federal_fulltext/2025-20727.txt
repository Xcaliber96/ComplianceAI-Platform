[Docket No. USCG-2024-1103]


Navigation and Navigable Waters, and Shipping; Technical, 
Organizational, and Conforming Amendments

AGENCY: Coast Guard, DHS.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This final rule makes non-substantive, technical, 
organizational, and conforming amendments to existing Coast Guard 
regulations. This represents a continuation of our practice of 
periodically issuing rules to keep our regulations up-to-date and 
accurate. This final rule is deregulatory in nature due to the 
discontinuation of the Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number 1625-0068. In all other 
respects, this final rule will have no substantive impact on the 
regulated public.

DATES: This final rule is effective November 24, 2025.

U.S.C. United States Code

II. Regulatory History

    We did not publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this 
rule. Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A), the Coast Guard finds that this final 
rule is exempt from notice and public comment rulemaking requirements 
because the changes made in this rulemaking involve rules of agency 
organization, procedure, or practice. In addition, the Coast Guard 
finds that notice and comment procedures are unnecessary under 5 U.S.C. 
553(b)(B), as this final rule consists of only technical and editorial 
corrections, and these changes will have no substantive effect on the 
public.\1\ Finally, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds, 
for the same reasons, that good cause also exists for making this final 
rule effective upon publication in the Federal Register.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ As explained below, notice and comment procedures are also 
unnecessary regarding the removal of 33 CFR part 133 because its 
removal flows directly from legislative changes made by the James M. 
Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, 
Public Law 117-263 (NDAA 2023), and leaves no room for the exercise 
of discretion by the Coast Guard.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Basis and Purpose

    The purpose of this final rule, which becomes effective on November 
24, 2025, is to make technical and editorial corrections throughout 33 
CFR chapter I and 46 CFR chapter I. These changes are necessary to 
update authority citations, correct errors, update contact information, 
and make other non-substantive amendments that improve the clarity of 
the CFR. This rule does not create or change any substantive 
requirements.
    The legal basis for this final rule rests on the authorities of 5 
U.S.C. 552(a) and 553; 14 U.S.C. 102 and 503; Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) Delegation No. 00170.1, Revision No. 01.4; and on 
authorities listed at the end of this rule for each CFR part this rule 
amends.

IV. Discussion of the Rule

    The Coast Guard periodically issues technical, organizational, and 
conforming amendments to existing regulations in titles 33 and 46 of 
the CFR. These technical amendments are intended to provide the public 
with more accurate and current regulatory information than exist in the 
rules they amend without changing the effect of any Coast Guard 
regulations on the public.

A. Authority Citation Updates

    This final rule implements updates to DHS Delegation No. 00170.1, 
Revision No. 01.4 in 33 CFR parts 1, 26, 62, 66, 67, 95, 97, 107, 114, 
115, 117, 118, 133, 151, 155, 159, 164, and 165, and 46 CFR parts 3, 4, 
7, 11, 24, 26, 58, 62, 68, 90, 110, 125, 126, 131, 177, 182, and 188.

B. Formatting Amendments To Accompany Technical Amendments in This 
Document

    While making the technical amendments within this document, we 
identified cases where the text of the existing CFR does not meet 
current formatting standards and made stylistic changes to bring the 
affected portions of the CFR into compliance. Our formatting amendments 
reflect direction in three sources prescribing stylistic standards for 
Federal documents--the Document Drafting Handbook (DDH),\2\ the 
Government Publishing Office (GPO) Style Manual, and Executive Order 
12866, 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 1993), which directs Federal agencies to 
provide information to the public in plain, understandable language. 
The DDH provides guidance on how to follow the formatting and editorial 
requirements established in 44 U.S.C. chapter 15 (the Federal Register 
Act) and 1 CFR chapter I.\3\ On page 2-55, the DDH refers readers to 
the GPO Style Manual as a guide for punctuation, capitalization, 
spelling, compounding, and other style matters not addressed in the 
DDH.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The DDH is published by the Office of the Federal Register. 
We consulted the August 2018 edition (Revision 2.2, dated June 
2025).
    \3\ See the Introduction to the DDH, at <a href="http://www.archives.gov/files/federal-register/write/handbook/ddh.pdf">www.archives.gov/files/federal-register/write/handbook/ddh.pdf</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Two stylistic changes occur repeatedly in this document. In cases 
where this final rule updates a mailing address that includes an 
abbreviation of a geographic quadrant, we have removed any periods from 
the abbreviation. This reflects Rule 9.17 in the GPO Style Manual,\4\ 
which states ``in addresses, no period is used with the abbreviations 
NW, SW, NE, SE (indicating sectional divisions of cities) following 
name or number.'' This final rule further replaces all instances of 
``shall'' in regulatory text otherwise amended by this rule with 
``must.'' We do so to follow a recommendation in the Federal plain 
language guidelines, posted on <a href="http://plainlanguage.gov">plainlanguage.gov</a>, that the word 
``shall'' should usually be replaced with the clearer and more commonly 
used ``must.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The GPO Style Manual is available at <a href="http://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2016/pdf/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2016.pdf">www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2016/pdf/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2016.pdf</a> (Last 
accessed 3-12-25).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Technical Amendments to 33 CFR

    In Sec.  1.07-100(a)(1), this final rule removes references to 
paragraph numbers in 46 U.S.C. 2101 because the paragraphs in that 
section of the U.S. Code have been renumbered, and the referenced 
paragraph numbers for the definitions of fishing vessel, fish 
processing vessel, and fish tender vessel are incorrect. We are not 
replacing the paragraph number references, as these definitions are 
listed in alphabetical order in the referenced statute, and cross-
referencing to a paragraph number is unnecessary. In addition, Congress 
updates 46 U.S.C. 2101 fairly frequently, and if we were to replace the 
paragraph numbers, they would likely be rendered incorrect the next 
time Congress updates the section.
    In Sec.  26.03(b), this final rule replaces the term ``Mega-Hertz'' 
with ``megahertz (MHz),'' to use GPO's preferred formatting and to help 
readers understand the use of the abbreviation elsewhere in the 
section.
    In Sec.  62.1, this final rule removes paragraph (b)(2), which 
references 33 CFR subpart 66.10 (which is deleted elsewhere in this 
rule), and redesignates Sec.  62.1(b)(1) as Sec.  62.1(b), as there are 
no longer any subordinate paragraphs under paragraph (b).
    In Sec.  62.21(c)(2), this final rule corrects internet addresses 
and a spelling error.
    In Sec.  62.47(a)(2), this final rule removes a reference to fog 
detector technology that is no longer in use and provides information 
on the technology that has replaced it.
    In Sec.  62.63(b)(2), this final rule replaces a reference to 
``loran,'' a radio navigation system no longer in use, with 
``electronic charting systems.''
    In Sec.  66.01-5, this final rule corrects an internet address in 
the introductory text.
    This final rule removes 33 CFR part 66 subpart 66.10. On June 19, 
1998 (63 FR 33570), the Coast Guard, exercising authorities in 14 
U.S.C. 83 (now 14 U.S.C. 542) and 33 U.S.C. 1333, announced a merger of 
the Uniform State Waterway Marking System with the United States Aids 
to Navigation System, to be phased in over a five-year period. As 
provided in a sunset provision (33 CFR 66.10-1(b)) that is removed by 
this rule, the regulations in the subpart ceased to be in effect after 
the phase-in period ended in 2003, when aids to navigation which had 
been governed by subpart 66.10, would be governed by part 62 of 
subchapter C of title 33.
    In Sec. Sec.  67.05-20 and 67.30-5(d), this final rule makes 
stylistic and grammatical corrections, changing ``Provided, That'' in 
both paragraphs to ``provided that.''

[[Page 52869]]

    In Sec.  67.40-1(a), this final rule replaces an outdated 
notification method (telegram) with newer methods (electronic mail and 
telephone) and, in paragraph (b), removes a reference to telegrams. 
Western Union stopped providing telegram service in 2006.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Mike Musgrove, ``The Telegram, 1844-2006,'' Washington 
Post (Feb 3, 2006).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In Sec.  67.40-1(b), this rule replaces the word ``telegraph'' with 
the word ``notification,'' consistent with the change made in Sec.  
67.40-1(a).
    In Sec.  67.50-25, this final rule updates the name of the district 
in the section heading and in paragraph (e) to reflect that on July 3, 
2025, the Coast Guard announced the renaming of its districts in an all 
Coast Guard Message (ALCOAST), ALCOAST 305/25 ``Force Design 2028--
Renaming Coast Guard Districts.'' In paragraph (e), this final rule 
also updates a street address, and an internal office routing symbol.
    In Sec.  95.010, this final rule removes from the definition of 
recreational vessel a reference to a paragraph in 46 U.S.C. 2101 
because the paragraphs in that section have been renumbered, as noted 
in our discussion of Sec.  1.07-100(a)(1). We are also adding the 
phrase ``of that term'' to clarify that the word ``definition'' refers 
to the definition of recreational vessel contained in 46 U.S.C. 2101.
    In Sec.  97.110(a), this final rule updates the name of the point 
of contact and substitutes the current contact's email address and 
phone number for the public to submit requests to view material 
incorporated by reference (IBR) in part 97.
    In Sec.  100.30, this final rule identifies the Captain of the Port 
(COTP) as the approval authority, except for those applications that 
are managed by the State. This change is consistent with 33 CFR 
100.35(a), which already acknowledges that COTPs can ``approv[e] plans 
for the holding of a regatta or marine parade within his or her . . . 
zone.''
    In Sec.  107.210(b), this final rule removes the reference to the 
paragraph number in 46 U.S.C. 2101 defining public vessel because the 
paragraphs in that section have been renumbered for the reasons 
provided in our discussion of Sec.  1.07-100(a)(1). We are also 
removing the reference to a definition of foreign vessel in 46 U.S.C. 
2101 as that definition has been removed from the section entirely. We 
are replacing it with a reference to the definition of foreign vessel 
in 46 U.S.C. 110, added by Public Law 109-304, Sec.  4, Oct. 6, 2006, 
120 Stat. 1487. Finally, we are adding a reference to the definition of 
vessel of the United States at 46 U.S.C. 116. Congress also added that 
definition in Public Law 109-304.
    In Sec.  114.50, this final rule adds an email address as an 
additional means for the public to submit appeals for the denial of 
bridge permits.
    In Sec.  115.50(a), this final rule adds language to require 
applicants for authorization to construct a bridge across navigable 
waters of the United States to include their email addresses in their 
applications. It also adds language advising applicants to refer to 
Commandant Publication (COMDTPUB) 16591, Bridge Permit Application 
Guide, for guidance on completing the application.
    In Sec.  115.60(a), this final rule removes the last three lines of 
that paragraph, which relate to procedures for compliance (in 
connection with the Coast Guard's issuance of a bridge permit) with 
water quality certification requirements under section 401 of the Clean 
Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1341. The language removed from Sec.  115.60(a) 
fulfilled requirements previously contained in an Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) regulation, 40 CFR 121.6(b), that Federal 
agencies provide the certifying authority notification of (a) the date 
it received a copy of the applicant's certification request to the 
certifying authority, (b) the ``applicable reasonable period of time to 
act on the certification request,'' and (c) ``the date upon which 
waiver will occur if the certifying authority fails or refuses to act 
on the certification request.'' See the version of 40 CFR 121.6 in 
effect on September 11, 2020. Also see the preamble of ``Clean Water 
Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification Improvement Rule,'' 88 FR 
66558, 66582 (Sept. 27, 2023), where EPA stated ``the Agency [EPA] is 
removing the regulatory text located at Sec.  121.6(b) in the 2020 
Rule, which required the Federal agency to communicate the date of 
receipt of the request for [water quality] certification, the 
reasonable period of time [to act on the request for certification], 
and the date waiver [of certification] will occur.'' The 2023 EPA rule 
which replaced the 2020 version of Sec.  121.6 renders the removed text 
of the EPA rule obsolete, as the 2023 rule sets the date from which the 
reasonable period of time begins for certification to occur, and 
provides that the reasonable period of time to act on a certification 
request is six months, unless the Federal agency and the certifying 
authority agree in writing to some other period that does not exceed 
one year.
    In Sec.  116.55(a), this final rule changes the word 
``recommendation'' to ``decision'' to describe a matter subject to 
appeal, to conform with the language used elsewhere in the section. We 
note here that a matter would not need to be appealed if it were merely 
a recommendation.
    In Sec.  116.55(b), this final rule adds email as a means of 
submitting an appeal under paragraph (a) of this section.
    In Sec. Sec.  117.255(a)(3)(i) and (a)(5)(i), this final rule 
updates a contact phone number.
    In Sec.  117.593(b)(2), this final rule adds language to clarify 
how the operation lights at the Chelsea Street Bridge work, to better 
reflect what a mariner sees at this location.
    In Sec.  117.997(c)(2)(i), this final rule adds the term 
``vessels'' after the term ``recreational'' to clarify that the phrase 
``that do not qualify under section'' applies only to commercial 
vessels. We also correct an incorrect reference to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) 
so that Sec.  117.997(c)(2)(i) refers to paragraph (c)(2)(ii), as 
paragraph (d) pertains to a different bridge, and paragraph (d)(2)(ii) 
does not exist.
    In Sec.  117.997(c)(2)(ii), this final rule corrects a 
typographical error by adding a space between ``at'' and ``7.''
    In Sec. Sec.  117.1087(a), 117.1087(a)(3), and 117.1087(a)(4), this 
final rule amends those sections to reflect changes in bridge names 
made by the bridge owner. The names of these bridges have already been 
corrected in Coast Pilot 6 (page 419),\6\ and are being used in general 
messaging between the Coast Guard and the bridge owner, including 
messaging regarding deviations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ <a href="http://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/publications/coast-pilot/files/cp6/CPB6_WEB.pdf">nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/publications/coast-pilot/files/cp6/CPB6_WEB.pdf</a> (Last accessed 3-12-25).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In Sec.  118.3(b), this final rule adds an email address for the 
public to submit requests to view material incorporated by reference 
(IBR) in part 118.
    This final rule removes 33 CFR part 133, which is now obsolete. 
Prior to December 23, 2022, when the NDAA 2023, became law, 33 U.S.C. 
2712(d) and (e) authorized and required the President to obligate 
appropriations into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for removal 
actions undertaken by the States, in a procedure (commonly known as 
``State access'') that was implemented in 33 CFR part 133. Section 
11314 of the NDAA 2023 removed those provisions in old 33 U.S.C. 
2712(d) and (e) and substituted the language which is now in current 
section 2712(d), for those provisions. That language authorizes States 
to use cost-reimbursable agreements and withdraws the Coast Guard's 
authority to administer the State access program.

[[Page 52870]]

    With the removal of 33 CFR part 133, the Coast Guard will 
discontinue the Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number 1625-0068. Accordingly, this 
technical amendment is considered deregulatory under Executive Order 
14192 (Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation) due to the 
elimination of a paperwork requirement. In addition, there is the 
triennial savings to the Federal Government (for example, Coast Guard, 
DHS and OMB) of not conducting a periodic renewal of the ICR, OMB 
Control Number 1625-0068. We consider this a non-quantifiable benefit.
    In Sec.  151.51(a)(1), this final rule removes incorrect citations 
to paragraphs referring to the definitions of recreational vessels and 
uninspected vessels in 46 U.S.C. 2101. This information is incorrect as 
the paragraphs in 46 U.S.C. 2101 have been renumbered, as explained in 
our discussion of Sec.  1.07-100(a)(1).
    In Sec. Sec.  155.4025, 155.4030(b), and 155.4040(c), this final 
rule replaces the term ``assessment of structural stability'' with 
``assessment of structure and stability.'' The term ``assessment of 
structural stability'' implies one distinct action but, as the Coast 
Guard stated in a response to comments on its 2008 final rule, Salvage 
and Marine Firefighting Requirements; Vessel Response Plans for Oil, 
``these are two distinct types of assessments that will be going on at 
the same time.'' \7\ We stated in the same paragraph of the 2008 rule 
that we agreed, in part, with the points made in the response to 
comments and added a sentence to the proposed definition (at 67 FR 
31868, 31874 (May 10, 2002)), but did not clarify that the term 
referred to two distinct actions. The change we are making in this 
final rule will clarify the two distinct actions required--the 
assessment of vessel stability and the assessment of structural 
integrity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 73 FR 80618, 80631 (Dec. 31, 2008).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In Sec. Sec.  155.5015(a)(3), 155.5020, and 159.305, this final 
rule removes references to paragraph numbers in 46 U.S.C. 2101 as the 
paragraphs have been renumbered, as explained in our discussion of 
Sec.  1.07-100(a)(1). In Sec. Sec.  155.5015(a)(3) and 159.305, we are 
not replacing the paragraph numbers referring to the definitions of 
navigable waters of the United States and cruise vessel, respectively. 
In Sec.  155.5020, however, we are replacing the paragraph number 
referring to the definition of navigable waters of the United States, 
now cited in Sec.  155.5020, with ``(23)'' because that regulation 
refers to the waters identified in 46 U.S.C. 2101(23) only as a subset 
of an alternative definition of that term, and not as the definition of 
navigable waters of the United States, which is used in Sec.  155.5020.
    In Sec.  164.01(b)(2), this final rule corrects an erroneous 
reference to the regulation containing the definition for assistance 
towing. 46 CFR 10.103, which the rule referenced prior to this change, 
is an IBR section; 46 CFR 10.107, which the rule references after the 
change, is the proper location of the definition.
    In Sec. Sec.  164.39(b), 165.123(b), 165.169(a), and 165.500(a)(4), 
this final rule removes references to paragraph numbers for the 
definitions of tanker, tank vessel, and passenger vessel in 46 U.S.C. 
2101 for the reasons provided in our discussion of Sec.  1.07-
100(a)(1).
    In Sec.  165.911(b)(2), this final rule updates contact information 
for the public to request permission to transit security zones in the 
Captain of the Port Eastern Great Lakes Zone.
    In Sec.  165.923(a)(2)(ii)(C), this final rule removes a reference 
to a paragraph number for the definition of commercial service in 46 
U.S.C. 2101 for the reasons provided in our discussion of Sec.  1.07-
100(a)(1) pertaining to the renumbering of paragraphs.
    In Sec.  165.1141(d)(2), this final rule updates contact 
information for the public to request permission to transit through the 
San Clemente Safety Zone.
    In Sec.  165.1157(a), this final rule adds degree, minute, and 
second symbols to the latitude and longitude coordinates for the Santa 
Barbara Breakwater Light.
    In Sec.  165.1711(c)(6), this final rule removes a reference to an 
incorrect paragraph number in 46 U.S.C. 2101 for the reasons provided 
in our discussion of Sec.  1.07-100(a)(1). In addition, the adjective 
``commercial'' has been removed before the phrase ``fishing vessels,'' 
as the definition of fishing vessel in Sec.  2101 is ``a vessel that 
commercially engages in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish or 
an activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the catching, 
taking, or harvesting of fish.'' (Emphasis added.)
    This final rule removes Sec. Sec.  174.17(c) and 174.19(c), which 
are obsolete paragraphs governing the issuance of certificates of 
number to vessels between April 27, 2012, and January 1, 2017. The 
appendix referenced in these sections has already been removed.

D. Technical Amendments to 46 CFR

    In Sec.  2.01-7, footnote 7, this final rule removes references to 
paragraphs in 46 U.S.C. 2101 defining passenger and passenger(s)-for-
hire, as the paragraphs have been renumbered. For more detail, see our 
explanation of the change to 33 CFR 1.07-100(a)(1).
    In Sec.  3.01-1, this final rule removes a reference to a paragraph 
number in 46 U.S.C. 2101 defining oceanographic research vessel because 
the paragraphs in that section of the U.S. Code have been renumbered. 
For more detail, see our explanation of the change to 33 CFR 1.07-
100(a)(1).
    In Sec. Sec.  4.03-50 and 7.1, this final rule removes a reference 
to a paragraph number in 46 U.S.C. 2101 for the definitions of 
recreational vessel, seagoing barges and seagoing motor vessels because 
the paragraphs in that section of the U.S. Code have been renumbered. 
For more detail, see our explanation of the change to 33 CFR 1.07-
100(a)(1).
    In Sec.  11.301, this final rule removes the reference to 
paragraphs 11(a) and 11(c) in 46 U.S.C. 2101 for the definitions of 
fishing vessel and fish-tender vessel because the paragraphs in section 
2101 have been renumbered, and the referenced paragraph numbers are no 
longer correct. We are not replacing the paragraph numbers, as 
definitions in section 2101 are listed in alphabetical order, and 
cross-referencing to a paragraph number is unnecessary for these 
definitions. We are retaining a reference to the subordinate paragraph 
associated with the definition of uninspected passenger vessels, 
however, because that subordinate paragraph designation remains 
unchanged and subordinate paragraphs (A) and (B) contain separate 
definitions.
    In Sec. Sec.  11.491(a) and 11.551, this final rule removes a 
reference to a U.S. Code paragraph in 46 U.S.C. 2101 for the definition 
of offshore supply vessel, as the paragraph has been renumbered. For 
more detail, see our explanation of the change to 33 CFR 1.07-
100(a)(1).
    In Sec.  15.105, this final rule removes the reference to 
paragraphs 12 and 14 in 46 U.S.C. 2101 because the paragraphs in 
section 2101 have been renumbered and the referenced paragraph numbers 
are no longer correct. We are not replacing the paragraph numbers, as 
definitions in section 2101 are listed in alphabetical order, and 
cross-referencing to a paragraph number is unnecessary for the 
definitions of fishing vessel and fish-tender vessel. We are retaining 
a reference to the subordinate paragraph associated with the definition 
of uninspected passenger vessels, however, because that subordinate 
paragraph designation remains unchanged and subordinate paragraphs (A) 
and (B) contain separate definitions.
    In Sec.  15.403(e), this final rule removes the reference to 
paragraphs for the

[[Page 52871]]

definitions of fishing vessels and fish-tender vessels in 46 U.S.C. 
2101 because the paragraphs in section 2101 have been renumbered, and 
the referenced paragraph number is no longer correct. We are not 
replacing the paragraph numbers, as definitions in section 2101 are 
listed in alphabetical order, and cross-referencing to a paragraph 
number is unnecessary. We are retaining a reference to the subordinate 
paragraph associated with the definition of uninspected passenger 
vessels, however, because that subordinate paragraph designation 
remains unchanged and subordinate paragraphs (A) and (B) contain 
separate definitions.
    In Sec. Sec.  15.720(b) this final rule removes references to 
paragraphs in the definitions of offshore supply vessel and mobile 
offshore drilling unit in 46 U.S.C. 2101, as the paragraphs in section 
2101 have been renumbered. For more detail, see our explanation of the 
change to 33 CFR 1.07-100(a)(1).
    In Sec.  15.1101(a), this final rule removes the reference to 
paragraphs 11(a) and 11(c) in 46 U.S.C. 2101 because the paragraphs in 
section 2101 have been renumbered and the referenced paragraph numbers 
for the definitions of fishing vessel and fish-tender vessel are no 
longer correct. For the reasons provided in our discussion of 33 CFR 
1.07-100(a)(1), we are not replacing the paragraph numbers. We are 
retaining a reference to the subordinate paragraphs associated with the 
definition of uninspected passenger vessels, however, because the 
subordinate paragraphs contain separate definitions.
    In Sec.  24.10-1, this final rule changes a reference in the 
definition of motorboat from table 24.05-1(a) in Sec.  24.05-1 to table 
2.01-7(a) in 46 CFR 2.01-7(a). In 2014, the Coast Guard issued a rule 
which removed table 24.05-1(a) from the CFR on the grounds that the 
table unnecessarily duplicated table 2.01-7(a).\8\ However, due to a 
drafting error, the rule did not update this cross-reference, and we 
correct that here.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ 79 FR 58270, 58272 (Sept. 29, 2014)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In Sec. Sec.  26.15-1(a) and 58.25-5(a), this final rule removes 
references to the U.S. Code paragraphs in 46 U.S.C. 2101 defining 
uninspected vessel, tanker, and tank vessel, as the paragraphs in 
section 2101 have been renumbered. For more detail, see our explanation 
of the change to 33 CFR 1.07-100(a)(1).
    In Sec.  62.50-30(k)(3), this final rule corrects a cross-
reference. Section 62.50-30(k)(3) incorrectly references paragraph (f) 
of Sec.  111.70-3 because the reference to that paragraph was not 
changed when the Coast Guard updated Sec.  111.70-3 in 1996 to 
eliminate obsolete requirements. This amendment corrects that oversight 
by changing the reference to paragraph (b) of Sec.  111.70-3, which now 
contains the material that had been in paragraph (f) of the 1995 
version of Sec.  111.70-3.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ In 1995, 46 CFR 111.70-3 contained paragraphs (a) to (k). 
Paragraph (f) was titled ``Low voltage release.'' On February 2, 
1996 (at 61 FR 4137), the Coast Guard proposed to revise 46 CFR 
subpart 111.70, stating ``the revision will eliminate obsolete 
requirements.'' Section 111.70-3 was revised in the interim final 
rule on June 4, 1996 (see 61 FR 28281 at <a href="http://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1996-06-04/pdf/96-13416.pdf">www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1996-06-04/pdf/96-13416.pdf</a>). The revision contains 
paragraphs (a) to (d). Paragraph (b), titled ``Low-voltage 
release,'' now contains the material which had been in paragraph (f) 
of the 1995 version of Sec.  111.70-3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In Sec.  68.55, this final rule removes a reference to the U.S. 
Code paragraph in 46 U.S.C. 2101 defining oil, as the paragraphs in 
section 2101 have been renumbered. For more detail, see our explanation 
of the change to 33 CFR 1.07-100(a)(1).
    In Sec.  90.10-23, this final rule changes a reference in the 
definition of motorboat from a table which has been removed (table 
90.05-1(a)) to a table with the same information in it (table 2.01-
7(a)). This should have been done in a rulemaking published on 
September 29, 2014, which stated at 79 FR 58270, 58272:

    ``This rule amends the following sections to remove repetitive 
tables: 46 CFR 24.05-1(a) . . ., 90.05-1(a) . . . . The repetitive 
tables are duplications of information contained in table 2.01-7(A) 
[sic], and therefore we replace the tables with a reference back to 
the complete, original table published as table 2.01-7(A) [sic] in 
46 CFR 2.01-7(a).''

    In Sec.  108.151(b), this final rule corrects a grammatical error 
by adding the word ``of.''
    In Sec.  110.01-3(c), this final rule removes a reference to the 
U.S. Code paragraph (14a) in 46 U.S.C. 2101 defining conversion, as the 
paragraphs in section 2101 have been renumbered. For more detail, see 
our explanation of the change to 33 CFR 1.07-100(a)(1). In addition, 
the word ``Major'' has been added before ``conversions'' because the 
current definition given in section 2101, and the definition given in 
the 1997 version of section 2101 (which contained paragraph 14a), was 
for ``major conversions.''
    In Sec.  118.400(f),\10\ this final rule corrects a reference to 
``paragraph (f) of this section'' to refer instead to paragraph (g). We 
redesignated Sec.  118.400(f) as Sec.  118.400(g) in 86 FR 73171 
(December 27, 2021), but failed to make a conforming change to the 
reference at that time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ Subpart D of Part 118 is titled ``Fixed Fire Extinguishing 
and Detecting Systems.'' Section 118.400 is titled ``Where 
required.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In Sec.  125.180(b)(4), this final rule corrects citations to 
sections in 46 CFR subchapter L, which incorporate by reference the 
American Bureau for Shipping's Rules for Building and Classing Mobile 
Offshore Drilling Units. It does not change the meaning of the 
regulations.
    In Sec.  126.180, this final rule removes a reference to the higher 
level paragraph in 46 U.S.C. 2101, as the number of the paragraph in 
that U.S. Code section containing the definition of passenger has 
changed. Because Sec.  126.180 refers the reader to a specific 
subordinate paragraph of the definition of ``passenger,'' we are 
revising the reference, ``46 U.S.C. 2101(21)(B)'' rather than deleting 
everything after ``2101.'' Our revision refers the reader to 
subordinate paragraph (B) of the paragraph containing the definition of 
passenger in 46 U.S.C. 2101. That paragraph applies specifically to a 
passenger on an offshore supply vessel.
    In Sec.  131.540(a), this final rule corrects the misspelling of 
the word ``each.''
    In Sec.  132.130(a), this final rule corrects the misspelling of 
the word ``fire.''
    In Sec.  133.130(b)(4)(i), this final rule corrects an editorial 
error by deleting the redundant words ``and list'' from the phrase 
``Within the limits of trim and list and list specified . . . .''
    In Sec.  147.65(b)(1), this final rule removes the words ``of 
pressure'' from the sentence ``If cylinder weight or liquid level, 
adjusted for temperature, shows a 5 percent loss of pressure, the 
cylinder must be refilled.'' A loss of cylinder weight or liquid level, 
adjusted for temperature, is distinct from a loss of pressure, so the 
earlier language was illogical.
    In Sec.  169.101, this final rule deletes a reference to a U.S. 
Code paragraph defining sailing school vessel because the paragraphs in 
46 U.S.C. 2101 have been renumbered, and the paragraph cited is no 
longer the correct one. For more detail, see our explanation of the 
change to 33 CFR 1.07-100(a)(1).
    In Sec.  177.410(b), this final rule removes the words ``meet as'' 
from the phrase ``. . . and meet as accepted by the Commandant as 
meeting . . .'' as both redundant and ungrammatical.
    In Sec.  181.115(b), this final rule, applicable to 46 CFR 
subchapters T and K, removes implementation deadlines that have passed 
and are no longer relevant. This final rule also corrects an error in 
Sec.  181.115 resulting from a previous rulemaking, published at 81 FR 
48220 (July 22, 2016). That 2016 rulemaking split an earlier version of 
Sec.  181.400 into two sections to separate

[[Page 52872]]

the identification of spaces required to have fixed fire extinguishing 
systems from the identification of spaces required to have fire 
detection systems. The portion of Sec.  181.400 dealing with fire 
extinguishing systems remained in Sec.  181.400, and the portion 
relating to fire detection systems was moved to Sec.  181.405. Section 
181.115, which had referred only to Sec.  181.400, was not changed in 
the 2016 rulemaking. This final rule corrects Sec.  118.115 by adding a 
reference to Sec.  181.405 to reflect that the identification of spaces 
required to have fire detection systems is now set out in that section.
    This final rule splits 46 CFR 181.300(d) into two separate 
paragraphs and redesignates what had been paragraph (e) as paragraph 
(f). The first sentence of paragraph (d), ``A fire pump may be driven 
by a propulsion engine,'' remains in paragraph (d). The second 
sentence, ``A fire pump must be permanently connected to the fire main 
and may be connected to the bilge system to meet the requirements of 
Sec.  182.520 of this chapter,'' is now paragraph (e). Having both 
requirements in one paragraph has caused confusion because people have 
incorrectly inferred that the second sentence is only applicable if the 
first sentence is true. Regardless of whether the fire pump is driven 
by a propulsion engine, however, the pump must be permanently attached 
to the vessel. A separate, portable pump does not meet the requirements 
set out in 46 CFR subpart D.
    This final rule adds paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) to Sec.  181.400. 
The language added here pertains to fire suppression system 
requirements and is being moved from the section addressing fire 
detection systems in 46 CFR 181.405. A 2016 rule \11\ for harmonizing 
fire safety standards split requirements (previously consolidated in 
Sec.  181.400) for both fire suppression and detection systems into 
Sec. Sec.  181.400 (Fire suppression systems) and 181.405 (Fire 
detection systems). The rulemaking inadvertently put some of the fire 
suppression requirements into the fire detection section. Rearranging 
these paragraphs will not change the requirements, but it will make the 
organization of the subpart more logical and consistent with the 
original intent as proposed. The original intent of the 2016 change is 
explained at 79 FR 2271, in the NPRM titled ``Harmonization of 
Standards for Fire Protection, Detection, and Extinguishing 
Equipment,'' and published on January 13, 2014. There, we stated:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ 81 FR 48299, 48300 (July 22, 2016)

    The existing regulations at Sec.  181.400 contain the 
requirements for both fire extinguishing systems and fire detection 
systems on small passenger vessels regulated under 46 CFR subchapter 
T. We propose to separate, for clarity, these requirements by 
removing the regulations for fire detection systems in Sec.  
181.400(c) through (g) and moving these regulations to proposed new 
Sec.  181.405(a) through (e). Further, we propose to amend the title 
of Sec.  181.400 to ``Spaces required to have fixed fire 
extinguishing systems,'' in order to clarify that this section would 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
contain the requirements for fire extinguishing systems only.

    In Sec.  181.405, this final rule removes fire suppression system 
requirements that are currently listed in the section designated for 
fire detection systems. As explained in the preceding paragraph 
regarding Sec.  181.400, the 2016 rule harmonizing fire safety 
standards split Sec.  181.400, which contained requirements for both 
fire suppression and detection systems, into Sec.  181.400 (Fire 
suppression systems) and Sec.  181.405 (Fire detection systems). The 
rulemaking inadvertently left some fire suppression requirements in the 
fire detection section. Rearranging these paragraphs will not change 
the requirements, but it will make the organization of the subpart more 
logical.
    In Sec.  182.115(c) and (d), this final rule removes an 
implementation deadline that has passed and is no longer relevant.
    In Sec.  188.10-77, this final rule changes a reference, in the 
definition of vessel, from a table (table 24.05-1(a)) which has been 
removed to another table (table 2.01-7(a)) with the same information in 
it. This change should have been done in a rulemaking published on 
September 29, 2014, where we stated the following, at 79 FR 58270, 
58272:

    This final rule amends 46 CFR 24.05-1(a) to remove repetitive 
tables. The repetitive tables are duplications of information 
contained in table 2.01-7(A)[sic], and therefore we replace the 
tables with a reference back to the complete, original table 
published as table 2.01-7(A) [sic] in 46 CFR 2.01-7(a).

V. Regulatory Analyses

    We developed this final rule after considering numerous statutes 
and Executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our 
analyses based on these statutes or Executive orders.

A. Regulatory Planning and Review

    Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and 13563 
(Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review) direct agencies to assess 
the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if 
regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize 
net benefits. Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of 
quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing 
rules, and of promoting flexibility.
    Executive Order 14192 (Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation) 
directs agencies to significantly reduce the private expenditures 
required to comply with Federal regulations and provides that ``any new 
incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent 
permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs 
associated with at least 10 prior regulations.''
    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has not designated this 
final rule a ``significant regulatory action'' under section 3(f) of 
Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, this rule has not been reviewed by 
OMB.
    This final rule is considered an Executive Order 14192 deregulatory 
action due to the elimination of a paperwork requirement. This final 
rule involves non-substantive, technical amendments and internal agency 
practices and procedures; it will not impose any additional costs. The 
technical amendments in this final rule fit into categories that 
involve (1) correcting inadvertent typographical errors in the CFR; (2) 
modifying existing language in the CFR by addition or subtraction to 
improve the readability or clarity of regulations; (3) removing 
irrelevant information, such as expired regulatory provisions or 
cancelled reference material, and replacing outdated regulatory 
information with current information, where applicable; and (4) 
revising office contact information and mailing addresses. This final 
rule will not impose any additional costs to the public or the Federal 
Government, because none of the technical and editorial changes in this 
final rule will impose new regulatory requirements. A summary of these 
amendments by category and by CFR title and section are presented in 
table 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Also, as discussed in the ``Discussion of the Rule'' section above, 
this final rule removes 33 CFR part 133, which is now obsolete. Prior 
to December 23, 2022, the date in which the NDAA 2023, became law, 33 
U.S.C. 2712(d) and (e) authorized and required the President to 
obligate appropriations into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for 
removal actions undertaken by the States, in a procedure (commonly 
known as ``State access'') that was implemented in 33 CFR part 133. 
Section 11314 of the NDAA 2023 removed those provisions in 33 U.S.C. 
2712(d) and (e) and substituted the language, which is now in section 
2712(d), for those provisions. That language authorizes States to use 
cost-reimbursable agreements and withdraws the Coast Guard's authority 
to administer the State access program.
    The benefits of the non-substantive technical amendments are 
increased accuracy of regulatory information by correcting erroneous 
information, and improved readability and clarity of regulations by 
removing redundant or confusing language and by removing expired or 
cancelled provisions that are no longer relevant. In addition, 
correcting technical items such as office contact details and location 
coordinates will improve the ability to reference and contact the 
correct entities.

B. Small Entities

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, requires 
federal agencies to consider the potential impact on small entities 
when they issue a rule after being required to first publish a general 
NPRM. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), a regulatory flexibility analysis is not 
required for this final rule because, under provisions in 553(b)(B), we 
were not required to publish a general NPRM. Therefore, we did not 
conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis for this rule.

C. Assistance for Small Entities

    Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996, Public Law 104-121, we offer to assist small 
entities in understanding this final rule so that they can better 
evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking. The 
Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or 
complain about this final rule or any policy or action of the Coast 
Guard.

D. Collection of Information

    This final rule calls for no new collection of information under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. However, with 
the removal of 33 CFR part 133 the Coast Guard will discontinue the ICR 
OMB Control Number 1625-0068.

E. Federalism

    A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132 
(Federalism) if it has a substantial direct effect on States, on the 
relationship between the National Government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13132 and 
have determined that it is consistent with the fundamental federalism 
principles and preemption requirements described in Executive Order 
13132.

F. Unfunded Mandates

    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538, 
requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary 
regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may 
result in the expenditure by a

[[Page 52874]]

State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private 
sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one 
year. Although this final rule will not result in such expenditure, we 
do discuss the effects of this final rule elsewhere in this preamble.

G. Taking of Private Property

    This final rule will not cause a taking of private property or 
otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630 
(Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected 
Property Rights), which addresses governmental actions and interference 
with property rights.

H. Civil Justice Reform

    This final rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 
3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice Reform) to minimize 
litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.

I. Protection of Children

    We have analyzed this final rule under Executive Order 13045 
(Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety 
Risks). This final rule is not an economically significant rule and 
will not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that 
might disproportionately affect children.

J. Indian Tribal Governments

    This final rule does not have tribal implications under Executive 
Order 13175 (Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments), because it will not have a substantial direct effect on 
one or more Indian Tribes, on the relationship between the Federal 
Government and Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes.

K. Energy Effects

    We have analyzed this final rule under Executive Order 13211 
(Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy 
Supply, Distribution, or Use). We have determined that it is not a 
``significant energy action'' under that order because it is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866 and is 
not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, 
distribution, or use of energy.

L. Technical Standards

    The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act, codified as a 
note to 15 U.S.C. 272, directs agencies to use voluntary consensus 
standards in their regulatory activities unless the agency provides 
Congress, through OMB, with an explanation of why using these standards 
would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. 
Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (for example, 
specifications of materials, performance, design, or operation; test 
methods; sampling procedures; and related management systems practices) 
that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.
    This final rule does not use technical standards or incorporation 
by reference. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary 
consensus standards.

M. Environment

    We have analyzed this final rule under Department of Homeland 
Security Management Directive 023-01, Rev. 1, associated implementing 
instructions, and Environmental Planning COMDTINST 5090.1 (series), 
which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have made 
a determination that this action is one of a category of actions that 
do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the 
human environment. A Record of Environmental Consideration supporting 
this determination is available in the docket. For instructions on 
locating the docket, see the ADDRESSES section of this preamble.
    This final rule is categorically excluded under paragraph A3 and 
L54 of Appendix A, Table 1 of DHS Instruction Manual 023-01-001-01, Rev 
1. Paragraph A3 pertains to: Promulgation of rules, issuance of rulings 
or interpretations, and the development and publication of policies, 
orders, directives, notices, procedures, manuals, advisory circulars, 
and other guidance documents of the following nature: (a) Those of a 
strictly administrative or procedural nature; (b) Those that implement, 
without substantive change, statutory or regulatory requirements; (c) 
Those that implement, without substantive change, procedures, manuals, 
and other guidance documents; (d) Those that interpret or amend an 
existing regulation without changing its environmental effect; (e) 
Technical guidance on safety and security matters; or (f) Guidance for 
the preparation of security plans. Paragraph L54 pertains to 
``Regulations which are editorial or procedural, such as those updating 
addresses or establishing application procedures.'' This final rule 
makes non-substantive technical, organizational, and conforming 
amendments to existing Coast Guard regulations and also, as explained 
above, implements without substantive changes, statutory requirements 
made by the NDAA 2023. This final rule is a continuation of our 
practice of periodically issuing rules to keep our regulations up-to-
date and accurate.

N. Congressional Review Act

    Before a rule can take effect, 5 U.S.C. 801, the Congressional 
Review Act, requires agencies to submit the rule and a report 
indicating whether it is a major rule to Congress and the Comptroller 
General. Under 5 U.S.C. 804(3)(C), rules of agency organization, 
procedure, or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or 
obligations of non-agency parties are not considered to be a rule for 
the purposes of the Congressional Review Act. This technical amendment 
is a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that will not 
substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties, 
thus it is not required to be submitted for review under the CRA.

Island Range Control, call sign ``STARBURST'' by either calling 619-

Channel 82A. Immediately upon completing transit, the vessel operator

Range Control of passage through the safety zone will result in a 
determination by the Navy that the vessel is still in the safety zone, 
thereby restricting the use of the area for naval operations. If the 
Navy determines that facilitating safe transit through the zone 
negatively impacts range operations, the Navy will cease this practice 
and enforce the safety zones in these two areas without exception.
