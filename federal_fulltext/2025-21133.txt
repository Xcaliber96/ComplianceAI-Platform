Overview of This Information Collection

    Title: Customs Declaration.
    OMB Number: 1651-0009.
    Form Number: 6059B.
    Current Actions: Revision.
    Type of Review: Revision.
    Affected Public: Individuals.
    Abstract: CBP Form 6059B, Customs Declaration, is used as a 
standard report of the identity and residence of each person arriving 
in the United States. This form is also used to declare imported 
articles to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in accordance with 
19 CFR 122.27, 148.12, 148.13, 148.110, 148.111; 31 U.S.C. 5316 and 
Section 498 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1498).
    Section 148.13 of the CBP regulations prescribes the use of the CBP 
Form 6059B when a written declaration is required of a traveler 
entering the United States. Oral declarations are permissible under 
conditions as provided by 19 CFR 148.12 (e.g., items below a certain 
value). However, CBP may require a written declaration at any time. If 
an oral declaration is not accepted under 19 CFR 148.12, a written 
declaration is required using CBP form 6059B pursuant to 19 CFR 148.13.
    CBP continues to find ways to improve the entry process through the 
use of mobile technology to ensure it is safe and efficient. To that 
end, CBP has deployed a process which allows travelers to use a mobile 
app to submit information to CBP prior to arrival in domestic locations 
and prior to departure at preclearance locations. This process, called 
Mobile Passport Control (MPC), allows travelers to use a designated 
lane upon arrival into the United States or departing a preclearance 
location. The MPC process also helps determine under what circumstances 
CBP should require a written customs declaration (CBP Form 6059B) and 
when it is beneficial to admit travelers who make an oral customs 
declaration during the primary inspection. MPC eliminates the 
administrative tasks performed by the officer during a traditional 
inspection and in most cases will eliminate the need for respondents/
travelers to fill out a paper declaration. MPC provides a more 
efficient and secure in person inspection between the CBP Officer and 
the traveler.
    MPC provides an electronic method for travelers to answer the 
questions that appear on form 6059B without filling out a paper form.
    A sample of CBP Form 6059B can be found at: <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/2024-07/cbp_form_6059b_english_0.pdf">https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/2024-07/cbp_form_6059b_english_0.pdf</a>.
    This collection is available in the following languages: English, 
French, Vietnamese, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, 
Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Hebrew, Spanish, Dutch, Arabic, Farsi, 
and Punjabi.
    Previously approved revisions: Due to the termination of the APC 
program, U.S. Legal permanent residents (LPR) and visa waiver country 
(VWP) visitors arriving for their second visit to the United States 
will be included into the MPC program. U.S. LPRs are eligible for 
Simplified Arrival's (SA) photo biometric confirmation upon arrival 
into the United States. Other classes of admission eligible for SA's 
photo biometric confirmation will be considered for MPC inclusion as a 
future update.
    CBP added a new mobile application, testing the operational 
effectiveness of allowing travelers to use the CBP Home mobile 
application to submit information to CBP, in advance, prior to arrival. 
This second mobile capability is under the current CBP Link\TM\ 
application, a platform that serves as a portal for travelers and 
stakeholders to virtually interact with CBP. The CBP Link\TM\ 
application will also allow travelers to self-segment upon arrival at 
land borders in the United States.
    Similar to the MPC application, the CBP Link\TM\ application 
eliminates the administrative tasks performed by the officer during a 
traditional inspection and in most cases will eliminate the need for 
respondents/travelers to fill out a paper declaration. In addition, the 
CBP Link\TM\ application will also provide a more efficient and secure 
in person inspection between the CBP Officer and the traveler at the 
land border.
    Unique to the CBP Link\TM\ application is that while the MPC 
submission is completed upon arrival, the CBP Link\TM\ application must 
be submitted in advance and will require the additional data elements:
    1. Traveler Identify the Port of Entry (POE).
    2. Time and/or date of arrival.
    In addition, travelers will provide their answers to CBP's 
questions, take a self-picture/selfie and submit the information via 
the CBP Link\TM\ application, after the plane lands. This will allow 
for advance vetting and proper resource management at the POE. This 
capability through the CBP Link\TM\ application is available to all 
travelers arriving with authorized travel documents, including foreign 
nationals.

New Changes

    1. MPC Expansion: CBP is now expanding the MPC program to visa-
exempt non-immigrants and non-immigrant visa-bearing travelers.
    As CBP expands Mobile Passport Control (MPC) to land ports of 
entry, new elements are being incorporated. Travelers arriving by 
personal vehicle will self-submit their vehicle's license plate number 
via the MPC application. This enables CBP to associate travelers with 
their conveyance, improving pre-arrival processing, situational 
awareness, and inspection efficiency at primary.
    To determine the correct Port of Entry (POE) for submission, MPC 
uses the device's location services to calculate proximity. A single 
latitude/longitude coordinate--determined by the device's hardware--is 
collected locally and immediately discarded after a distance 
calculation is performed on the device. CBP does not receive or retain 
specific device location data; only the closest POE is selected for 
submission.
    At primary inspection, CBP Officers use Simplified Arrival to 
process MPC travelers. Travelers group together by their MPC 
application will be linked in SA via their license plate number. When a 
license plate is read on primary, a function that SA already has, any 
MPC application associated to that plate number, within the time frame 
submitted by the traveler, will populate in SA. SA displays all 
relevant traveler data--including biographic, passport, and customs 
declaration information--alongside any enforcement flags. This 
integrated process provides a secure, efficient experience for both 
officers and travelers.
    In the commercial bus environment, both individual travelers and 
carriers will be able to submit traveler information via the MPC 
application. Carriers will create an MPC shell that will be available 
to travelers to input their information into; carriers would input 
information of travelers who did not submit into the shell themselves. 
Travelers will be linked to the arriving conveyance using the bus's 
license plate number, allowing CBP to connect submissions to group 
manifests. This enhances processing for high-volume passenger arrivals 
and ensures accurate vetting.
    For travelers arriving in the pedestrian environment, no additional 
data elements are required beyond those already collected in the air 
and sea environments. The process remains fundamentally the same, with 
MPC submissions including biometric and biographic data for Simplified 
Arrival (SA) processing. Travelers benefit from the same streamlined, 
paperless experience, and CBP benefits from continuity across all 
travel modes.

    MPC will also be integrating I94 application and payments, in 
stages. Initially MPC will provide a link and a prompt to the public 
I94 website where MPC participants can apply and pay for their I94, if 
their information provided to MPC indicates they need a I94. Once 
communication is established between MPC and the public I94 website, 
biographical information (name, DOB, passport number, ext.) already 
provided to MPC by the traveler will be prepopulated into the I94 
website for fast and more consistent applications. Eventually 
applicants will be able to both apply for and pay for their I94 without 
leaving the MPC app.
