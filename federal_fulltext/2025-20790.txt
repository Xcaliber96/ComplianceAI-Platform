SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Authority for This Rulemaking

    The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is 
found in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, Section 106, 
describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, 
Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's 
authority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described 
in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, 
the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of 
airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient 
use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that authority, 
as it would amend Class D and Class E4 airspace in Wilkes-Barre, PA.

Comments Invited

    The FAA invites interested persons to participate in this 
rulemaking by submitting written comments, data, or views. Comments are 
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, 
environmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal. The most 
helpful comments reference a specific portion of the proposal, explain 
the reason for any recommended change, and include supporting data. To 
ensure the docket does not contain duplicate comments, commenters 
should submit only one time if comments are filed electronically, or 
commenters should send only one copy of written comments if comments 
are filed in writing.
    The FAA will file in the docket all comments it receives, as well 
as a report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA 
personnel concerning this proposed rulemaking. Before acting on this 
proposal, the FAA will consider all comments it receives on or before 
the closing date for comments. The FAA will consider comments filed 
after the comment period has closed if it is possible to do so without 
incurring expense or delay. The FAA may change this proposal in light 
of the comments it receives.
    Privacy: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(c), DOT solicits comments 
from the public to better inform its rulemaking process. DOT posts 
these comments, without edits, including any personal information the 
commenter provides, to <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a>, as described in the system

Incorporation by Reference

    Class D and Class E4 airspace designations are published in 
paragraphs 5000 and 6004 of FAA Order JO 7400.11, Airspace Designations 
and Reporting Points, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 
on an annual basis. This document proposes to amend the current version 
of that order, FAA Order JO 7400.11K, dated August 4, 2025, and 
effective September 15, 2025. These updates would be published in the 
next update to FAA Order JO 7400.11. FAA Order JO 7400.11K, which lists 
Class A, B, C, D, and E airspace areas, air traffic service routes, and 
reporting points, is publicly available as listed in the ADDRESSES 
section of this document.

The Proposal

    This action proposes an amendment to 14 CFR part 71 modifying the 
Class D and Class E4 airspace for Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International 
Airport, Wilkes-Barre, PA. Controlled airspace is necessary for the 
safety and management of IFR operations in the area for existing 
instrument approach procedures.
    This action proposes to amend the Class D airspace over Wilkes-
Barre, PA, by updating the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport 
geographic coordinates and increasing the lateral boundary of the Class 
D airspace from a 4.1-mile radius of the airport to a 4.2-mile radius 
of the airport.
    This action also proposes to amend the Class E4 airspace over 
Wilkes-Barre, PA, by modifying the dimensions from the current 
configuration to that airspace extending upward from the surface within 
2 miles each side of a 033[deg] bearing from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton 
International Airport extending from the 4.2-mile radius to 9.4 miles 
northeast of the airport, and within 1 mile either side of a 214[deg] 
bearing from the airport extending from the 4.2-mile radius to 7.3 
miles southwest of the airport. This reconfiguration will properly 
contain the currently published standard instrument approach 
procedures.
    This action also proposes to remove the language in the Wilkes-
Barre, PA, Class E4 Airspace legal description that indicates a part-
time status, as the control tower is in operation 24 hours a day.

Regulatory Notices and Analyses

    The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves 
an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and 
routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. 
It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under 
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
Department of Transportation (DOT) Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation 
of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. 
Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic 
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this proposed rule, 
when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Environmental Review

    This proposal will be subject to an environmental analysis in 
accordance with FAA Order 1050.1G, ``FAA National Environmental Policy 
Act Implementing Procedures'' prior to any FAA final regulatory action.
