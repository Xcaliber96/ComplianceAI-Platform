making and distributing phonorecords of nondramatic musical works 
regarding physical phonorecords and Permanent Downloads.

DATES: 
    Effective date: December 1, 2025.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anita Brown, CRB Program Specialist, 
(202) 707-7658, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8ae9f8e8cae6e5e9a4ede5fc"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2447564664484b470a434b52">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 115 of the Copyright Act, title 17 
of the United States Code, creates a statutory license for making and 
distributing phonorecords of nondramatic musical works. On December 16, 
2022, the Copyright Royalty Judges (Judges) adopted final regulations 
governing the rates and terms of copyright royalty payments under that 
license for the license period 2024-2027 for making and distributing 
phonorecords of nondramatic musical works. See 87 FR 76942.
    Pursuant to those regulations, at least 25 days before January 1 of 
each year, the Judges shall publish in the Federal Register notice of a 
cost of living adjustment (COLA) applicable to the royalty fees for 
making and distributing physical phonorecords and Permanent Downloads. 
See 37 CFR 385.11.
    The adjustment in the royalty fee shall be based on a calculation 
of the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban 
Consumers (CPI-U) published in November 2022 (298.012) \1\ (``base 
rate'') according to the following formulas: for the per-work rate, (1 
+ (Cy-298.012 \2\)/298.012) x 12[cent], rounded to the nearest tenth of 
a cent; for the per-minute rate, (1 + (Cy-298.012)/298.012) x 
2.31[cent], rounded to the nearest hundredth of a cent; where Cy is the 
CPI-U published by the Secretary of Labor before December 1 of the 
preceding year. 37 CFR 385.11(a)(2). The CPI-U published by the 
Secretary of Labor from the most recent index published before December 
1, 2025, is 324.800.\3\ Applying the formulas in 37 CFR 385.11(a)(2) 
results in an increase in the rates for 2026.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The CPI-U published in November 2022 is available at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/cpi_11102022.htm">https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/cpi_11102022.htm</a> at Table 1.
    \2\ Base rate.
    \3\ The CPI-U announced on October 24, 2025, by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics in its Consumer Price Index News Release--Consumer 
Price Index, is available at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf">https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf</a> at Table 1 (last viewed on Nov. 25, 2015). The Copyright 
Royalty Judges note that the October 24, 2025, publication is the 
most recent CPI-U published by the Secretary of Labor before 
December 1 of the preceding year of this COLA adjustment (i.e., 
2026). The Bureau of Labor statistics has explained ``BLS could not 
collect October 2025 reference period survey data due to a lapse in 
appropriations.'' See <a href="https://www.bls.gov/bls/2025-lapse-revised-release-dates.htm">https://www.bls.gov/bls/2025-lapse-revised-release-dates.htm</a> (last viewed on Nov. 25, 2025).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The adjusted rates for 2026 are 13.1 cents for the per-work rate 
and 2.52 cents for the per-minute rate.
