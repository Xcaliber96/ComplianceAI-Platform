COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION


Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records

AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

ACTION: Notice of a modified system of records.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and in compliance 
with Executive Order 14249, Protecting America's Bank Account Against 
Fraud, Waste, and Abuse, and Office of Management and Budget Memorandum 
M-25-32, Preventing Improper Payments and Protecting Privacy Through Do 
Not Pay, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) 
is modifying four Privacy Act systems of records by adding a new 
routine use to permit the disclosure of records to the Department of 
the Treasury. In addition, in accordance with Office of Management and 
Budget Memorandum M-17-12, Preparing for and Responding to a Breach of 
Personally Identifiable Information, the CFTC is adding routine uses to 
three of those systems of records to permit the disclosure of records 
in response to a breach. These modified systems of records will be 
included in the CFTC's inventory of record systems.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 
and in compliance with Executive Order 14249, Protecting America's Bank 
Account Against Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (E.O. 14249), and Office of 
Management and Budget Memorandum M-25-32, Preventing Improper Payments 
and Protecting Privacy Through Do Not Pay (OMB M-25-32), the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) is modifying four 
Privacy Act systems of records by adding a new routine use to permit 
the disclosure of records to the Department of the Treasury to review 
payments through the Do Not Pay Working System.
    A ``routine use'' means, with respect to the disclosure of a 
Privacy Act record, the use of such record for a purpose which is 
compatible with the purpose for which it is collected.'' 5 U.S.C. 
552a(a)(7). All agency systems of records must have a system of records 
notice (SORN) published in the Federal Register and the SORN must 
describe ``each routine use of the records contained in the system, 
including the categories of users and the purposes of such use.'' 5 
U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(D).
    E.O. 14249 promotes financial integrity by enabling the Department 
of the Treasury to more easily conduct improper payment and fraud 
prevention screening prior to disbursing funds on behalf of agencies'' 
It requires agencies to review and modify, as applicable, their 
relevant system of records notices

[[Page 54641]]

under the Privacy Act of 1974 to include a ``routine use'' that allows 
for the disclosure of records to the Department of the Treasury for the 
purposes of identifying, preventing, or recouping fraud and improper 
payments, to the extent permissible by law.
    The Office of Management and Budget, in OMB M-25-32, issued 
guidance concerning the routine use provisions in E.O. 14249. OMB M-25-
32 requires agencies, in accordance with the Executive Order, to 1. 
identify which of their systems of records maintain information about 
applicants for, or recipients of, Federal funds that agencies use to 
make eligibility determinations for payments to beneficiaries, award 
and loan recipients, vendors, contractors, and other payees; 2. 
determine which of those systems of records maintain information whose 
disclosure to Treasury would be relevant and necessary for identifying, 
preventing, or recouping improper payments by reviewing payment and 
award eligibility through the Do Not Pay Working System; and 3. report 
to OMB and Congress in accordance with OMB Circular No. A-108 any 
proposal(s) to add the following routine use to the agency's SORN(s) or 
to modify an existing routine use in the agency's SORN(s) so that it 
conforms to the following routine use:

    To the U.S. Department of the Treasury when disclosure of the 
information is relevant to review payment and award eligibility 
through the Do Not Pay Working System for the purpose of 
identifying, preventing, or recouping improper payment to an 
applicant for, or recipient of, Federal funds, including funds 
disbursed by a state (meaning a state of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United 
States, or a federally recognized Indian tribe) in a state-
administered, federally funded program.

    The Commission has reviewed its SORNs and determined, in accordance 
with the mandate in E.O. 14249 and the guidance in M-25-32, to modify 
four of the CFTC SORNs to include the required routine use. These are:

<bullet> CFTC-5 Employee Personnel, Payroll, Time and Attendance
<bullet> CFTC-6 Employee Travel and Transportation Records
<bullet> CFTC-49 Whistleblower Records
<bullet> CFTC-51 Contractors and Consultants

    In addition to adding the required routine use for disclosure to 
the Department of the Treasury to the above-referenced SORNs, the 
Commission has also determined to add two additional routine uses to 
permit disclosure of records in the context of a breach to three of 
those SORNs:

<bullet> CFTC-5 Employee Personnel, Payroll, Time and Attendance
<bullet> CFTC-6 Employee Travel and Transportation Records
<bullet> CFTC-49 Whistleblower Records

    Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-17-12, Preparing for 
and Responding to a Breach of Personally Identifiable Information, (OMB 
M-17-12) sets forth the policy for Federal agencies to prepare for and 
respond to a breach of personally identifiable information (PII). It 
established two model routine uses, one permitting the disclosure of 
information related to breaches of an agency's own records, and the 
second permitting the disclosure of agency records to assist other 
agencies in their efforts to respond to a breach. To date, the 
Commission has been adding these routine uses to individual SORNs when 
they otherwise require a modification, relying until those updates are 
in place on the Commission's blanket routine use 19, which closely 
parallels the first of OMB M-17-12's model routine uses. See 76 FR 
5974. To that end, the Commission is deleting the reference to blanket 
routine use 19 in these three SORNs and including the following routine 
uses from OMB M-17-12:

    To appropriate agencies, entities, and persons when (1) the 
Commission suspects or has confirmed that there has been a breach of 
the system of records, (2) the Commission has determined that as a 
result of the suspected or confirmed breach there is a risk of harm 
to individuals, the Commission (including its information systems, 
programs, and operations), the Federal Government, or national 
security; and (3) the disclosure made to such agencies, entities, 
and persons is reasonably necessary to assist in connection with the 
Commission's efforts to respond to the suspected or confirmed breach 
or to prevent, minimize, or remedy such harm.
    To another Federal agency or Federal entity, when the Commission 
determines that information from this system of records is 
reasonably necessary to assist the recipient agency or entity in (1) 
responding to a suspected or confirmed breach or (2) preventing, 
minimizing, or remedying the risk of harm to individuals, the 
recipient agency or entity (including its information systems, 
programs, and operations), the Federal Government, or national 
security, resulting from a suspected or confirmed breach.

    Finally, the Commission is making minor administrative edits to the 
System Location and System Manager sections of all four SORNs to 
address organizational changes within the Commission since they were 
last published.
    These modified systems of records will be included in the CFTC's 
inventory of record systems and, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), 
the CFTC has provided a report of these modified systems of records to 
the Office of Management and Budget and to Congress.
