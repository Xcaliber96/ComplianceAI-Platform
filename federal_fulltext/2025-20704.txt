Notice Of Schedule for the Preparation of an Environmental 
Assessment for the TTC Connector Project

    On July 21, 2025, TTC Connector, LLC (TTC) filed an application in 
Docket No. CP25-525-000 requesting a Certificate of Public Convenience 
and Necessity pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, to 
construct and operate certain natural gas pipeline facilities in 
Colorado and Wharton counties, Texas. The proposed project is known as 
the TTC Connector Project (Project), and would provide 300,000 
dekatherms (Dth) a day of firm capacity.
    On August 4, 2025, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
(Commission or FERC) issued its Notice of Application for the Project. 
Among other things, that notice alerted agencies issuing federal 
authorizations of the requirement to complete all necessary reviews and 
to reach a final decision on a request for a federal authorization 
within 90 days of the date of issuance of the Commission staff's 
environmental document for the Project.
    This notice identifies Commission staff's intention to prepare an 
environmental assessment (EA) for the Project and the planned schedule 
for the completion of the environmental review.\1\ The EA will be 
issued for a 30-day comment period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For tracking purposes under the National Environmental 
Policy Act, the unique identification number for documents relating 
to this environmental review is EAXX-019-20-000-1759314183

Schedule for Environmental Review

Issuance of EA January 16, 2026
    90-day Federal Authorization Decision Deadline \2\ April 16, 2026
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The Commission's deadline applies to the decisions of other 
federal agencies, and state agencies acting under federally 
delegated authority, that are responsible for federal 
authorizations, permits, and other approvals necessary for proposed 
projects under the Natural Gas Act. Per 18 CFR 157.22(a), the 
Commission's deadline for other agency's decisions applies unless a 
schedule is otherwise established by federal law.

    If a schedule change becomes necessary, additional notice will be 
provided so that the relevant agencies are kept informed of the 
Project's progress.

Project Description

    TTC proposes to construct and operate approximately 25 miles of 20-
inch-diameter steel pipeline, connecting existing and proposed 
facilities. The Project would include the construction and operation of 
a proposed receipt interconnect point and proposed compressor station 
to three proposed interconnect stations. The Project would provide firm 
capacity from Enbridge Inc.'s Tres Palacios Gas Storage (Tres Palacios) 
to interconnects with Energy Transfer Partners, LP's Trunkline 
Pipeline, Gulf South Pipeline Company's Coastal Bend Header 
Interconnect Station, and at a downstream point on the Tres Palacios 
system.

Background

    On September 10, 2025, the Commission issued a Notice of Scoping 
Period Requesting Comments on Environmental Issues for the Proposed TTC 
Connector Project (Notice of Scoping). The Notice of Scoping was sent 
to affected landowners; federal, state, and local government agencies; 
elected officials; environmental and public interest groups; Native 
American tribes; other interested parties; and local libraries and 
newspapers. We received comments from the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) Region 6 and from potentially affected landowners.
    EPA's comments addressed water quality; dredge and fill impacts to 
waters of the United States; Clean Water Act section 303(d); biological 
resources, habitat and wildlife; air quality; hazardous materials, 
hazardous waste, and solid waste; coordination with Tribal governments, 
and the National Historic Preservation Act. The primary issues raised 
by landowners include potential effects on ecosystems, water resources, 
vegetation, migratory birds and waterfowl, threatened and endangered 
species, farming operations, crop growth and soil compaction, and 
alternatives. Commenters questioned whether the public necessity for 
the proposed Project has been demonstrated and further questioned the 
validity of using eminent domain for private financial gain. All 
substantive comments will be addressed in the EA.
