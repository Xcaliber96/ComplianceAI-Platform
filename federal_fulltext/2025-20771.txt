SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In compliance with 44 U.S.C. 3507, FDA has 
submitted the following proposed collection of information to OMB for 
review and clearance.

Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products

OMB Control Number 0910-0595--Extension

    This information collection helps support implementation of Agency 
policies applicable to the authorization for medical products for use 
in emergencies under sections 564, 564A, and 564B of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3, 360bbb-3a, and 
360bbb-3b). For more information regarding emergency use authorization 
(EUA), visit our website at <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization">https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization</a>. The FD&C Act permits the Commissioner of Food and Drugs 
(the Commissioner) to authorize the use of unapproved medical products 
for humans and animals, or unapproved uses of approved medical products 
for humans and animals, during an emergency declared under section 564 
of the FD&C Act. The data to support issuance of an EUA must 
demonstrate that, based on the totality of the scientific evidence 
available to the Commissioner, including data from adequate and well-
controlled clinical trials (if available), it is reasonable to believe 
that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or 
preventing a serious or life-threatening disease or condition (21 
U.S.C. 360bbb-3(c)).
    Also, under section 564 of the FD&C Act, the Commissioner may 
establish conditions on issuing an authorization that may be necessary 
or appropriate to protect the public health. These conditions can 
include: (1) requirements to disseminate or disclose information to 
healthcare providers or authorized dispensers and product recipients; 
(2) adverse event monitoring and reporting; (3) data collection and 
analysis; (4) specific recordkeeping and records access; (5) 
restrictions on product advertising, distribution, and administration; 
and (6) limitations on good manufacturing practice requirements. As 
governed by statute, some conditions are mandatory to the extent 
practicable for authorizations of unapproved products, and 
discretionary for authorizations of unapproved uses of approved 
products. Some conditions may apply to manufacturers of an EUA product, 
while other conditions may apply to any person who carries out an 
activity for which the authorization is issued. Sections 564A and 564B 
of the FD&C Act establish streamlined mechanisms intended to facilitate 
preparedness and response activities involving certain FDA approved 
products without requiring FDA to issue an EUA and set forth emergency 
dispensing order and expiration date extension authority.
    The guidance document entitled, ``Emergency Use Authorization of 
Medical Products and Related Authorities'' (January 2017), available 
for download from our website at <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/emergency-use-authorization-medical-products-and-related-authorities">https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/emergency-use-authorization-medical-products-and-related-authorities</a>, discusses FDA issuance of 
Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) under section 564 of the FD&C Act; 
implementation of the emergency use authorities set forth in section 
564A of the FD&C Act; reliance on the governmental pre-positioning 
authority set forth in section 564B of the FD&C Act; and related FDA 
regulations. As discussed in the guidance document, the specific type 
and amount of data needed to support an EUA will vary depending on the 
nature of the declared emergency and the nature of the candidate 
product. The guidance document encourages early engagement with FDA, 
explains mechanisms for communication, and makes content and format 
recommendations on submitting information to the Agency. The guidance 
document also recommends that a request for consideration for an EUA 
include scientific evidence evaluating the product's safety and 
effectiveness, including the adverse event profile for diagnosis, 
treatment, or prevention of the serious or life-threatening disease or 
condition, as well as data and other information on safety, 
effectiveness, risks and benefits, and (to the extent available) 
alternatives.
    In accordance with 5 CFR 1320.8(d), we published a 60-day notice 
soliciting public comment on information collection activities related 
to emergency use authorization for medical products in the Federal 
Register of July 14, 2025 (90 FR 31217). Under the 60-day notice, FDA 
invited comments on the following topics: (1) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
FDA's functions, including whether the information will have practical 
utility; (2) the accuracy of FDA's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways 
to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, 
including through the use of automated collection techniques, when 
appropriate, and other forms of information technology.
    One comment was received. The comment did not discuss information 
collection activities related to emergency use authorization for 
medical products, was not responsive to the four information collection 
topics solicited, and did not offer information that would enable FDA 
to consider revising the information collection and/or burden 
estimates. Instead, the comment raised policy concerns about FDA's 
implementation of section 564 of

[[Page 52963]]

the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3). Such 
comments may be offered to FDA through alternative means, such as 
directly to the FDA docket for the 2017 EUA guidance (which remains 
continually open for submissions) (FDA-2016-D-1025) or through FDA's 
citizen petition process (21 CFR 10.30). Therefore, the comment will 
not be addressed in this document.
    FDA estimates the burden of this collection of information as 
follows:

\1\ There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs associated with this collection of
  information.

    Although we have averaged burden across all respondents, we 
categorize reporting activity by the type of EUA-related submission: 
(1) those who file a request for FDA to issue an EUA and/or a 
substantive amendment to an EUA that has previously been issued; (2) 
those who submit a request for FDA to review information/data (i.e., a 
pre-EUA package) for a candidate EUA product or a substantive amendment 
to an existing pre-EUA package for preparedness purposes; (3) those who 
must report on activities related to an unapproved EUA product (e.g., 
administering product, disseminating information) who must report to 
FDA regarding such activity; (4) public health authorities (e.g., 
State, local) who must report on certain activities (e.g., 
administering product, disseminating information) related to an 
unapproved EUA, and public health authorities who submit an expiration 
date extension request for an approved product; (5) those who request 
an emergency dispensing order under section 564A; and (6) those who 
request expiry dating extensions under section 564A of the FDC&C Act. 
We attribute greater burden to those requests for FDA to review pre-EUA 
packages submitted by product sponsors than burden we attribute to 
those submitted by Federal agencies (e.g., Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, the Department of Defense), and have considered other 
factors that contribute to variability in burden for reporting, 
including the type of product and whether there is a previously 
reviewed pre-EUA package or investigational application.
    We also account for burden that may be attendant to the use of the 
following agency EUA Templates and Fact Sheet Templates:

2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (Revised) and Policy for 
Monkeypox [mpox] Tests to Address the Public Health Emergency guidance 
documents, which also include additional policies specific to these 
public health emergencies. The templates reflect the FDA's current 
thinking on the data and information that developers should submit to 
facilitate the EUA process. The templates provide information and 
recommendations, and they are updated as appropriate as we learn more 
about the COVID-19 and mpox diseases and gain experience with the EUA 
process for the various types of tests. Developers who intend to use 
alternative approaches should consider seeking the FDA's feedback or 
recommendations to help them through the EUA process.
    The CDER templates reflect the FDA's current thinking on the data

\1\ There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs associated with this collection of
  information.

    We provide a conservative estimate for respondent recordkeeping, 
recognizing that the Federal Government performs much of this activity 
in conjunction with submissions. We do not include burden for public 
health authorities who may need to submit emergency dispensing orders 
or expiration date extension requests, assuming covered entities 
already maintain these records for the products they stockpile.

    Our third-party disclosure estimate is based on the number of EUA 
holders and authorized stakeholders disseminating information, 
including fact sheets, advertising, and promotional materials.
    Our estimated burden for the information collection reflects an 
overall decrease of 7,087 hours and a corresponding decrease of 302,456 
responses.

Lowell M. Zeta,
Acting, Deputy Commissioner for Policy, Legislation, and International 
Affairs.
