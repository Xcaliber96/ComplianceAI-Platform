SUMMARY: The Copyright Royalty Judges announce a cost of living 
adjustment (COLA) of 2.9% in the royalty rates satellite carriers pay 
for a compulsory license under the Copyright Act. The COLA is based on 
the change in the Consumer Price Index from October 2024 to September 
2025.

DATES: 
    Effective date: December 1, 2025.
    Applicability dates: These rates are applicable to the period

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anita Brown, CRB Program Specialist, 
(202) 707-7658, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d7b4a5b597bbb8b4f9b0b8a1"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="90f3e2f2d0fcfff3bef7ffe6">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The satellite carrier compulsory license 
establishes a statutory copyright licensing scheme for the distant 
retransmission of television programming by satellite carriers. 17 
U.S.C. 119. Congress created the license in 1988 and reauthorized the 
license for additional five-year periods until 2019 when it made the 
license permanent.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The most recent five-year reauthorization was pursuant to 
the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014, Public Law 113-200. The 
license was made permanent by the Satellite Television Community 
Protection and Promotion Act of 2019, Public Law 116-94, div. P, 
title XI, Sec.  1102(a), (c)(1), 133 Stat. 3201, 3203.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On August 31, 2010, the Copyright Royalty Judges (Judges) adopted 
rates for the section 119 compulsory license for the 2010-2014 term. 
See 75 FR 53198. The rates were proposed by Copyright Owners and 
Satellite Carriers \2\ and were unopposed. Id. Section 119(c)(2) of the 
Copyright Act provides that, effective January 1 of each year, the 
Judges shall adjust the royalty fee payable under section 119(b)(1)(B) 
``to reflect any changes occurring in the cost of living as determined 
by the most recent Consumer Price Index (for all consumers and for all 
items) [CPI-U] published by the Secretary of Labor before December 1 of 
the preceding year.'' Section 119 also requires that ``[n]otification 
of the adjusted fees shall be published in the Federal Register at 
least 25 days before January 1.'' 17 U.S.C. 119(c)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Program Suppliers and Joint Sports Claimants comprised the 
Copyright Owners while DIRECTV, Inc., DISH Network, LLC, and 
National Programming Service, LLC, comprised the Satellite Carriers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The change in the cost of living as determined by the CPI-U during 
the period from the most recent index published before December 1, 
2024, to the most recent index published before December 1, 2025, is 
2.9%.\3\ Application of the 2.9% COLA to the current rate for the 
secondary transmission of broadcast stations by satellite carriers for 
private home viewing--36 cents per subscriber per month--results in a 
rate of 37 cents per subscriber per month (rounded to the nearest 
cent). See 37 CFR 386.2(b)(1). Application of the 2.9% COLA to the 
current rate for viewing in commercial establishments--74 cents per 
subscriber per month--results in a rate of 76 cents per subscriber per 
month (rounded to the nearest cent). See 37 CFR 386.2(b)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The CPI-U announced on October 24, 2025, by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics in its Consumer Price Index News Release--Consumer 
Price Index, is available at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf">https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf</a> at Table 1 (last viewed Nov. 25, 2025). The Copyright 
Royalty Judges note that the October 24, 2025, publication is the 
most recent CPI-U published by the Secretary of Labor before 
December 1 of the preceding year of this COLA adjustment (i.e. 
2026). The Bureau of Labor statistics has explained ``BLS could not 
collect October 2025 reference period survey data due to a lapse in 
appropriations.'' See <a href="https://www.bls.gov/bls/2025-lapse-revised-release-dates.htm">https://www.bls.gov/bls/2025-lapse-revised-release-dates.htm</a>. The change in the cost of living during the 
period from the most recent index published prior to the previous 
notice to the most recent index published prior to December 1 of 
this year i.e. the change from October 2024 to September 2025 is 
2.9% ((324.800-315.664)/315.664).
