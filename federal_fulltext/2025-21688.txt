Overview of This Information Collection

    1. Abstract: The Gun Control Act and other statutes prohibit 
persons from importing firearms, ammunition, and defense articles into 
the US unless the articles meet certain criteria, the importer is not a 
prohibited person, and the Attorney General (delegated to Director, 
ATF) approves that person to import those items. ATF uses this form to 
collect the information necessary to determine the above facts and 
approve a person to import the articles; the form then serves as their 
permit to do so.
    2. Type of information collection: revision of a previously 
approved collection.
    3. Title of the form/collection: Application/Permit to Import 
Firearms, Ammunition, and Defense Articles.
    4. Agency form number, if any, and the applicable component of the 
Department sponsoring the collection:
    Form number: ATF Form 5330.3A (``Form 6, part I'').
    Component: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; 
U.S. Department of Justice.
    5. Affected public who will be asked or required to respond, as 
well as the obligation to respond:
    Affected public: individuals or households, state, local and tribal 
governments, private sector-for-profit institutions, and federal 
government.
    Obligation to respond: required to obtain or retain a benefit.
    6. Estimate of the total number of respondents and the amount of 
time estimated for an average respondent to respond: An estimated 
13,777 respondents will respond to this information collection once 
annually, and it will take each respondent an average of 17 minutes 
(0.281 hours) to complete their responses (approximately 30 minutes for 
persons submitting a paper form, or 15 minutes for persons submitting 
electronically).
    7. Estimate of the total annual burden (in hours) associated with 
the collection: The estimated annual public burden associated with this 
collection is 3,869 total hours, which is equal to 13,777 (total 
respondents) * 1 (# of responses per respondent) * 0.281 (17 minutes).
    8. Estimate of the total annual other cost burden associated with 
the collection, if applicable: $1,241.

Revisions to This Information Collection

    ATF is revising this information collection, OMB 1140-0005, to 
reflect an increase in the number of persons who submit requests to 
import, from 10,000 three years ago to 13,777 in 2025, an increase of 
3,777 requests annually. In addition, the collection has been revised 
to reflect a change in the amount of time it takes to complete and 
submit the information, due to technological developments. More than 90 
percent of respondents now respond via ATF's online eForms system, 
cutting out the time involved in completing and mailing paper forms. As 
a result of these combined changes, the information collection has been 
revised to reflect a decrease in the total annual hourly burden, from 
5,000 hours three years ago to 3,869 in 2025, a decrease of 1,131 
hours. In addition, ATF is including monetized value of this time due 
to recent OMB changes and has also made small revisions to the title to 
make it easier to read.
