    k. Description of Project: The proposed project would consist of:

impulse-type turbine with a rated generating capacity of 220 kilowatts

year for domestic water supply to the City of Chignik.

interstate or foreign commerce. The Commission also determines whether 
or not the project: (1) would be located on a navigable waterway; (2) 
would occupy public lands or reservations of the United States; (3) 
would utilize surplus water or water power from a government dam; or 
(4) would be located on a non-navigable stream over which Congress has 
Commerce Clause jurisdiction and would be constructed or enlarged after 
1935.
