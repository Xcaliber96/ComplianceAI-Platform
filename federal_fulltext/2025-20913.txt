[Docket No. RM01-5-000]


Electronic Tariff Filings; Corrections to Etariff Tables

    Take notice that the .CSV files for the eTariff Validation Error 
Codes, Attachment Reference Code, and Attachment Content Type Code have 
been reposted on <a href="http://ferc.gov">ferc.gov</a> (<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/ferc-online/etariff">https://www.ferc.gov/ferc-online/etariff</a>) to 
correct posting errors.
    <bullet> The eTariff Validation Error Codes table is revised to 
include error code 190 that had been inadvertently omitted. On March 
27, 2025, a notice was posted advising filing parties that Validation 
Error code 190 was being deployed on April 28, 2025, notifying filers 
that their filing has been rejected because tariff records contain 
track change markings in documents submitted as Microsoft Word 
files.\1\ That revision inadvertently was not incorporated into the 
Validation Error Codes table. The table has now been updated to include 
code 190. To avoid triggering a rejection for including track changes, 
make sure to click on the ``Accept All Changes and Stop Tracking'' 
option to ensure track changes have been removed before submission.
