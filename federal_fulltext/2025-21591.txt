    The meetings will be closed to the public in accordance with the 
provisions set forth in sections 552b(c)(4) and 552b(c)(6), Title 5 
U.S.C., as amended. The grant applications and the discussions could 
disclose confidential trade secrets or commercial property such as 
patentable material, and personal information concerning individuals 
associated with the grant applications, the disclosure of which would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

    This notice is being published less than 15 days from the 
meeting date due to exceptional circumstances. As a result of the 
43-day government shutdown, due to lapsed appropriations, the above 
meeting was canceled. This meeting was to assess the scientific and 
technical merit of NIH grant applications, required by statute to 
disburse NIH funds. The meeting must take place urgently so that 
evaluations of biomedical research applications addressing multiple 
major public health priorities can be submitted to the national 
advisory councils for timely funding recommendations.
