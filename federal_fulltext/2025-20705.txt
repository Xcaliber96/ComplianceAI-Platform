for public comment on the notice. Interested persons are invited to 
send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this 
collection of information, including the necessity and utility of the 
proposed information collection for the proper performance of the 
agency's functions, the accuracy of the estimated burden, ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be 
collected, and the use of automated collection techniques or other 
forms of information technology to minimize the information collection 
burden.

DATES: Comments on the collection(s) of information must be received by 
the OMB desk officer by December 24, 2025.

ADDRESSES: Written comments and recommendations for the proposed

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), federal agencies must obtain approval from 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for each collection of 
information they conduct or sponsor. The term ``collection of 
information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and 
includes agency requests or requirements that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a third party. 
Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)) requires 
federal agencies to publish a 30-day notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed collection of information, including each 
proposed extension or reinstatement of an existing collection

of information, before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. 
To comply with this requirement, CMS is publishing this notice that 
summarizes the following proposed collection(s) of information for 
public comment.
    1. Type of Information Collection Request: Reinstatement without 
change of a previously approved collection; Title of Information 
Collection: FOIA/Privacy Act Requests for Medicare Claims Data via CMS 
FOIA Public Portal; Use: This collection of information is dedicated to 
Medicare beneficiaries and third-party requesters (law firms or others) 
acting on behalf of beneficiaries that are making requests for CMS to 
produce Medicare beneficiary records through 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (See also 
42 CFR 401.136). The online portal allows for ease and efficiency in 
uploading requests and required authorizations. Additionally, with the 
portal, requesters can securely submit requests electronically that 
contain PHI or PII. They are advised that <a href="http://MyMedicare.gov/Blue">MyMedicare.gov/Blue</a> Button3 
is an online service available for beneficiaries to set up an account 
to access their own records and give authorization to share with third 
parties. This secure public online portal is integrated with CMS's 
current FOIA/Privacy Act case management system to enter, track, and 
process incoming FOIA requests (See 45 CFR 5.22 and 5.24). Unless 
permitted or required by law, the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule (45 CFR 164.508) prohibits 
Medicare (a HIPAA-covered entity) from disclosing an individual's 
protected health information without valid authorization. Form Number: 
CMS-10781 (OMB control number: 0938-1419); Frequency: Reporting--
