SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Executive Summary

A. Does this action apply to me?

    This action provides information that is directed to the public in 
general.

B. What is the Agency's authority for taking this action?

    EPA is publishing this document in the Federal Register as required 
by sections 5 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. 
2601 et seq., and corresponding EPA regulations.
    Under TSCA, a chemical substance may be either an ``existing'' 
chemical substance or a ``new'' chemical substance, see <a href="https://www.epa.gov/chemicals-under-tsca">https://www.epa.gov/chemicals-under-tsca</a>. Any chemical substance that is not on 
EPA's TSCA Inventory of Chemical Substances (TSCA Inventory) is 
classified as a ``new chemical substance,'' while a chemical substance 
that is listed on the TSCA Inventory is classified as an ``existing 
chemical substance.'' See TSCA section 3(2) and (11). For more 
information about the TSCA Inventory, see <a href="https://www.epa.gov/inventory">https://www.epa.gov/inventory</a>.
    Any person who intends to manufacture (including import) a new 
chemical substance for a non-exempt commercial purpose, or to 
manufacture or process a chemical substance in a non-exempt manner for 
a use that EPA

[[Page 55109]]

has determined is a significant new use, is required by TSCA section 5 
to provide EPA with a PMN, MCAN, or SNUN, as appropriate, before 
initiating the activity. EPA will review the notice, make a risk 
determination on the new chemical substance or significant new use, and 
take appropriate action as described in TSCA section 5(a)(3).
    TSCA section 5(h)(1) authorizes EPA to allow persons, upon 
application and under appropriate restrictions, to manufacture a new 
chemical substance, or manufacture or process a chemical substance 
subject to a significant new use rule (SNUR) issued under TSCA section 
5(a)(2), for ``test marketing'' purposes, upon a showing that the 
manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of 
the chemical substances will not present an unreasonable risk of injury 
to health or the environment. This is referred to as a test marketing 
exemption, or TME.
    Premanufacture notification procedures for review of certain new 
microbial products of biotechnology are established in 40 CFR part 725. 
These pertain to MCANs and biotechnology exemptions, including TSCA 
experimental release applications (TERAs), TMEs for microorganisms, and 
Tier I and Tier II exemptions.

C. What action is the Agency taking?

    This document provides notice of receipt and status reports for the 
covered period and certain submissions under TSCA section 5 and 
provides an opportunity to comment on this information. The Agency is 
providing information about the receipt of PMNs, SNUNs, MCANs, and 
amendments to a previously submitted notice; test information; 
biotechnology exemption applications under 40 CFR part 725; TME 
applications; NOCs for new chemical substances; and a periodic status 
report on chemical substances that are currently under EPA review or 
have recently concluded review.

D. What should I consider as I prepare my comments for EPA?

    1. Submitting CBI. Do not submit CBI to EPA through <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> or email. If you wish to include CBI in your 
comment, please follow the instructions at <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets#rules">https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets#rules</a> and clearly mark the information that you 
claim to be CBI. In addition to one complete version of the comment 
that includes CBI, a copy of the comment without CBI must be submitted 
for inclusion in the public docket. Information marked as CBI will not 
be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR 
parts 2 and 703.
    2. Tips for preparing your comments. When preparing and submitting 
your comments, see the commenting tips at <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets">https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets</a>.
