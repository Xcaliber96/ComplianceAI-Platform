2025. Submissions received after the deadline for receiving comments 
may not be considered.

ADDRESSES: Written comments and recommendations for the proposed 
information collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of 
this notice to <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a>. Find this particular 
information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day Review--
Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function.
    The Office of Management and Budget is particularly interested in 
comments which:
    1. Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, 
including whether the information will have practical utility;
    2. Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    3. Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and
    4. Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those 
who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, 
electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic 
submissions of responses.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In 2006, Congress passed Public Law 109-295, 
which included SEC. 671. EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS also known as the 
``21st Century Emergency Communications Act of 2006'. The legislation 
established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of 
Emergency Communications, which was re-designated in 2018 as the 
Emergency Communications Division (ECD) within the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), to lead the development and 
implementation of a comprehensive approach to advancing national 
interoperable communications capabilities. The following 
responsibilities were established: 6 U.S.C. 571(c) which requires the 
DHS Secretary through the ECD Assistant Director to: (4) Conduct 
extensive, nationwide outreach to support and promote the ability of 
emergency response providers and relevant government officials to 
continue to communicate in the event of natural disasters, acts of 
terrorism, and other man-made disasters; (13) develop and update 
periodically, as appropriate, a National Emergency Communications Plan 
(NECP) under section 572 of this title; (14) perform such other duties 
of the Department necessary to support and promote the ability of 
emergency response providers and relevant government officials to 
continue to communicate in the event of natural disasters, acts of 
terrorism, and other man-made disasters; and (15) perform other duties 
of the Department necessary to achieve the goal of and maintain and 
enhance interoperable emergency communications capabilities. 6 U.S.C. 
572(a) requires the Secretary in cooperation with State, local, and 
tribal governments, Federal departments and agencies, emergency 
response providers, and the private sector, to develop not later than 
180 days after the completion of the baseline assessment under section 
573 of this title, and periodically update the NECP.
    Lastly, 6 U.S.C. 573 requires the DHS Secretary to conduct an 
assessment of Federal, State, local, and tribal governments that 
defines the range of capabilities needed by emergency response 
providers and relevant government officials, assesses the current 
available capabilities to meet such communications needs; identify the 
gaps between such current capabilities and defined requirements; at 
least every five years. These authorities, in addition to DHS 
responsibilities through Executive Order 13618 in the area of national 
security/emergency providers' communications, require periodic 
reexamination of nationwide emergency communications capabilities.
    To perform these statutory obligations, CISA seeks renewal of its 
PRA Generic Clearance to maintain flexibility in implementing surveys 
that are relevant to the current emergency communications environment. 
To meet the statutory requirements of 6 U.S.C. 573, ECD conducts the 
SAFECOM Nationwide Survey (SNS) to assess evolving capability needs and 
gaps and track progress against policy initiatives, status of strategic 
plans, and major industry or market shifts affecting the emergency 
communications capability.
    The purpose of the SNS is to gather information to assess available 
emergency communications capabilities and identify gaps and needs for 
emergency response providers to effectively communicate during all 
types of natural or man-made hazards. CISA ECD uses this information to 
complete its statutorily mandated assessment and share the data with 
all stakeholders that have a role in emergency communications. In order 
to ascertain this information, the SNS is comprised of a battery of 
instruments designed and distributed to emergency response disciplines 
at the federal, state/territorial, tribal, and local (county and 
municipal) levels of government, as well as the private sector. Methods 
of administration (questionnaire or interview) and distribution (online 
web form distributed via email or print forms

[[Page 54733]]

distributed by mail) are used as appropriate to meet the needs and 
preferences of various segments of the target population. The SNS 
solicits responses regarding issues affecting the emergency 
communications to determine a jurisdiction's level of communications 
operability, interoperability, continuity, and security. CISA ECD 
analyzes the data collected from this general survey to identify major 
gaps and themes affecting emergency communications across levels of 
government. This analysis informs the development of supplemental 
surveys and information collections tailored to specific needs across 
the emergency response community, as well as future iterations of the 
Nationwide Baseline Communications Assessment (NCBA), Biennial Progress 
Report (BPR), National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP), and other 
products and initiatives that enable ECD to carry out its statutory 
responsibilities at 6 U.S.C. 571(c).
    Findings from the SNS provide invaluable insights that CISA ECD 
shares with emergency communications partners at all levels of 
government which assists with: (1) Statewide Communications 
Interoperability Plan (SCIP) development, (2) Threat and Hazard 
Identification Risk Analysis (THIRA) development, (3) state-level grant 
programs and guidance, and (4) funding and resource sharing strategy 
development.
    CISA ECD also conducts supplemental surveys to complete statutorily 
mandated activities (6 U.S.C. 571(c), 572(a), and 573) and will share 
the data with relevant emergency communications partners. The SAFECOM 
supplemental surveys deploy topic-specific or targeted surveys to 
various emergency response disciplines at the federal, state, 
territorial, tribal, and local levels of government, as appropriate, as 
well as the private sector. The instruments solicit responses regarding 
targeted issues affecting specific segments of the emergency response 
community. CISA ECD analyzes the data collected from these supplemental 
surveys to identify changing requirements, mitigate risks, and help 
further inform the data collected from the SNS.
