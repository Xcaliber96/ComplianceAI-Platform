SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In compliance with 44 U.S.C. 3507, FDA has 
submitted the following proposed collection of information to OMB for 
review and clearance.

Administrative Procedures for Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments of 1988 Categorization

OMB Control Number 0910-0607--Extension

    This information collection helps support implementation of 
statutory provisions applicable to laboratories that conduct testing on 
human specimens under CLIA. These requirements are codified in 42 
U.S.C. 263a and implementing regulations are found in 42 CFR 493. 
Regulations in 42 CFR 493.17 set forth certain notice requirements and 
establish test categorization criteria for laboratory tests and are 
implemented by FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The 
guidance document entitled ``Administrative Procedures for CLIA 
Categorization'' (October 2017) (available at <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/administrative-procedures-clia-categorization">https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/administrative-procedures-clia-categorization</a>) describes procedures FDA uses to assign 
the complexity category to a device. Typically, FDA assigns complexity 
categorizations to devices at the time of clearance or approval of the 
device. In some cases, however, a manufacturer may request CLIA 
categorization even if FDA is not simultaneously reviewing a 510(k) or 
premarket approval application. One example is when a manufacturer 
requests that FDA assign CLIA categorization to a previously cleared 
device that has changed names since the original CLIA categorization. 
Another example is when a device is exempt from premarket review. In 
such cases, the guidance recommends that manufacturers provide FDA with 
a copy of the package insert for the device and a cover letter 
indicating why the manufacturer is requesting a categorization (e.g., 
name change, exempt from 510(k) review). The guidance recommends that 
in the correspondence to FDA the manufacturer should identify the 
product code and classification as well as reference to the original 
510(k) when this is available.
    In addition, this information collection includes provisions 
associated with certificates of waiver. The guidance document entitled 
``Recommendations for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 
1988 (CLIA) Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of In Vitro 
Diagnostic Devices--Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'' (February 
2020) (available at <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recommendations-clinical-laboratory-improvement-amendments-1988-clia-waiver-applications">https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recommendations-clinical-laboratory-improvement-amendments-1988-clia-waiver-applications</a>) describes recommendations for 
device manufacturers submitting to FDA an application for determination 
that a cleared or approved device meets this CLIA standard (CLIA waiver 
application). The guidance recommends that CLIA waiver applications 
include a description of the features of the device that make it 
``simple''; a report describing a hazard analysis that identifies 
potential sources of error, including a summary of the design and 
results of flex studies and conclusions drawn from the flex studies; a 
description of fail-safe and failure alert mechanisms and a description 
of the studies validating these mechanisms; a description of clinical 
tests that demonstrate the accuracy of the test in the hands of 
intended operators; and statistical analyses of clinical study results.
    In the Federal Register of July 3, 2025 (90 FR 29568), FDA 
published a 60-day notice requesting public comment on the proposed 
collection of information. No comments were received.
    FDA estimates the burden of this collection of information as 
follows:

    FDA estimates an increase of 30 responses for requests for CLIA 
categorization and 7 responses for waiver application submission based 
on recent FDA receipt data to more accurately reflect recent receipts 
of requests for CLIA categorization and CLIA waiver application 
submissions. Our total burden for this collection will be 80,430 hours 
(24,430 reporting + 56,000 recordkeeping). Our estimated burden for the 
information collection reflects an overall increase of 28,030 hours and 
a corresponding increase of $190,150 total operating and maintenance 
costs.
