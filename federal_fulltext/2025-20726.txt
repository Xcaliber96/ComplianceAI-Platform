II. Background Information and Regulatory History

    The Coast Guard is issuing this final rule under the authority in 5 
U.S.C. 553(b). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule 
without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for 
good cause finds that those procedures are ``impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' Under 5 U.S.C. 
553(b), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing 
a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule 
because it is impracticable and unnecessary. This bridge is non-
operational and will remain non-operational until rehabilitation work 
can be completed.
    On September 27, 2025, the Coast Guard issued a General Deviation 
which allowed the bridge owner, the Massachusetts Department of 
Transportation, to deviate from the current operating schedule in 33 
CFR 117.588 to construct a temporary bridge immediately adjacent to the 
existing bridge, which was assessed as structurally deficient. Due to 
the time required to construct the temporary fixed bridge and demolish 
the existing bridge, the project will run past the end date of April 
27, 2026, of the General Deviation. The existing bridge cannot be 
brought back to operating condition as it has been assessed as 
structurally unsound and is scheduled for demolition. In addition, the 
temporary bridge placement makes it impossible to fully open the swing 
drawbridge. Because the drawbridge must remain closed indefinity 
through its demolition, it is impossible to comply with the existing 
drawbridge operating schedule and soliciting comments on the operating 
schedule change is unnecessary. It is also impracticable to solicit 
comments prior to the drawbridge operating schedule change because it 
is already permanently closed due to the drawbridge being structurally 
unsound.
    Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause 
exists for making it effective in less than 30 days after publication 
in the Federal Register. For reasons presented above, delaying the 
effective date of this rule would be impracticable and contrary to the 
public interest due to the fact that the bridge is currently inoperable 
and cannot go back into operation until the rehabilitation work can be 
completed.

III. Legal Authority and Need for Rule

    The Coast Guard is issuing this rule under authority in 33 U.S.C. 
499.
    The Hall Whitaker Bridge across the Bass River at mile 0.6 in 
Beverly, Massachusetts, is a movable swing bridge with a closed 
vertical clearance of 4.62 feet and an open vertical clearance of 43.6 
feet. The bridge's operating regulations are contained in 33 CFR 
117.558.
    The Hall Whitaker Bridge was closed to vehicular traffic in June 
2022 in response to a substandard load rating. The bridge's structural 
deficiencies are beyond repair, and the bridge must be fully replaced. 
In preparation for the bridge replacement, a temporary bridge will be 
constructed immediately adjacent to the existing bridge, and the 
existing bridge will be demolished. During the construction of the 
temporary bridge, the existing bridge will be unable to open for marine 
traffic.
    There is only one waterfront facility, a yacht club, upstream of 
the Hall Whitaker Bridge. Bridge openings average 20 per year and are 
highly seasonal, concentrated in the Spring and Fall months when larger 
vessels move to and from the yacht club for winter storage. As part of 
the planning in advance of construction of the temporary bridge, 
Massachusetts Department of Transportation has made alternate 
arrangements for impacted vessels to reach their winter storage 
facility upstream of the Hall Whitaker Bridge.

IV. Discussion of the Final Rule

    This rule changes the operating schedule of the Hall Whitaker 
Bridge in 117.588(c) to allow the movable span to remain in the closed 
position. Previously, this paragraph required the drawbridge to open on 
signal if at least

[[Page 52883]]

24 hours' notice was given. Vessels able to pass underneath the bridge 
in the closed position will be able to transit. Upon completion of 
design and construction of the new bridge, the Coast Guard may propose 
a new drawbridge operating schedule, as needed.

V. Regulatory Analyses

    We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and 
Executive Orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses 
based on a number of these statutes and Executive Orders.

A. Impact on Small Entities

    The regulatory flexibility analysis provisions of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, do not apply to rules that 
are not subject to notice and comment. Because the Coast Guard has, for 
good cause, waived the notice and comment requirement that would 
otherwise apply to this rulemaking, the Regulatory Flexibility Act's 
flexibility analysis provisions do not apply here.
    Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), if this rule will affect your 
small business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have 
questions, contact the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION 
CONTACT section.
    Small businesses may send comments to the Small Business and 
Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small 
Business Regulatory Fairness Boards by calling 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-
734-3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities 
that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of 
the Coast Guard.

B. Collection of Information

    This rule calls for no new collection of information under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).

C. Federalism and Indian Tribal Government

    A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, 
Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have 
determined that it is consistent with the fundamental federalism 
principles and preemption requirements described in Executive Order 
13132.
    Also, this rule does not have tribal implications under Executive 
Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on 
one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal 
Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.

D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) 
requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary 
regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may 
result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in 
the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for 
inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in 
such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere 
in this preamble.

E. Environment

    We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security 
Management Directive 023-01, Rev.1, associated implementing 
instructions, and Environmental Planning Policy COMDTINST 5090.1 
(series) which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f). The 
Coast Guard has determined that this action is one of a category of 
actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant 
effect on the human environment. This rule promulgates the operating 
regulations or procedures for drawbridges and is categorically excluded 
from further review, under paragraph L49, of Appendix A, Table 1 of DHS 
Instruction Manual 023-01-001-01, Rev. 1.
    Neither a Record of Environmental Consideration nor a Memorandum 
for the Record are required for this rule.

List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117

provisions of Sec.  118.160 of this chapter.
    (c) The drawspan for the Hall Whitaker Drawbridge will remain in 
the closed to navigation position.
