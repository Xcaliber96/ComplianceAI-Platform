comments as CBI. Please mark each page of your submission that 
constitutes CBI as ``PROPIN'' to indicate it contains proprietary 
information. FMCSA will treat such marked submissions as confidential

II. Legal Basis

    FMCSA has authority under 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b) to grant 
exemptions from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. FMCSA 
must publish a notice of each exemption request in the Federal Register 
(49 CFR 381.315(a)). The Agency must provide the public an opportunity 
to inspect the information relevant to the application,

[[Page 53049]]

including the applicant's safety analysis. The Agency must provide an 
opportunity for public comment on the request.
    The Agency reviews the application, safety analyses, and public 
comments submitted and determines whether granting the exemption would 
likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the 
level that would be achieved absent such exemption, pursuant to the 
standard set forth in 49 U.S.C. 31315(b)(1). The Agency must publish 
its decision in the Federal Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, 
the notice will identify the regulatory provision(s) from which the 
applicant will be exempt, the effective period, and all terms and 
conditions of the exemption (49 CFR 381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption is 
denied, the notice will explain the reason for the denial (49 CFR 
381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may be renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)).

III. Applicant's Request

Current Regulatory Requirements

    Under 49 CFR 383.23, no person shall operate a commercial motor 
vehicle (CMV) without having taken and passed both knowledge and 
driving skills tests for a commercial learner's permit or CDL for the 
CMV that person operates or expects to operate that meet the Federal 
standards contained in subparts F, G, and H of Part 383. Under 49 CFR 
395.8(a)(1)(i), drivers required to prepare records of duty status must 
do so using ELDs. Under 49 CFR 395.8(a)(1)(ii)(A)(1), a motor carrier 
may allow its drivers to record their duty status manually, rather than 
use an ELD, if the driver is operating a CMV ``[i]n a manner requiring 
completion of a record of duty status on not more than 8 days within 
any 30-day period.''

Applicant's Request

    Project Gap is a food pantry and emergency supply program operated 
by Diamond Excursions Ladies Edition a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt 
organization. Project Gap delivers and picks up donated goods--
including food, water, hygiene items, and essential supplies--for 
underserved communities and areas affected by natural disasters. 
Unpaid, volunteer drivers conduct all transportation. According to 
Project Gap, the vehicle use is limited to donation collection, 
community distribution events, and disaster relief missions, some in 
interstate commerce. Project Gap states that these trips are infrequent 
and mission specific. Project Gap confirmed to FMCSA that its trips 
exceed 8 days in a 30-day period, so it is not eligible for the 
exception in 49 CFR 395.8(a)(1)(ii)(A)(1). Project Gap states that 
compliance with the CDL requirements in 49 CFR part 383 and the ELD 
requirements in 49 CFR part 395 pose significant burdens on Project 
Gap's ability to serve affected communities, particularly during 
emergencies and natural disasters.

Applicant's Equivalent Level of Safety

    Project Gap states that it is committed to operating safely and 
responsibly. It says that all drivers are trained and insured and 
comply with medical and safety screenings. These drivers, however, do 
not have CDLs. Project Gap states that it maintains detailed records of 
vehicle use, routes, and trip purposes.
    A copy of the applicant's application for exemptions is available 
for review in the docket for this notice.

IV. Request for Comments

    In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31315(b), FMCSA requests public 
comment from all interested persons on Project Gap's application for 
exemptions from the CDL requirements in 49 CFR 383.23 and the ELD 
requirements in 49 CFR 395.8(a)(1)(i). All comments received before the 
close of business on the comment closing date will be considered and 
will be available for examination in the docket at the location listed 
under the ADDRESSES section of this notice. Comments received after the 
comment closing date will be filed in the public docket and will be 
considered to the extent practicable. In addition to late comments, 
FMCSA will also continue to file, in the public docket, relevant 
information that becomes available after the comment closing date. 
Interested persons should continue to examine the public docket for new 
material.

Associate Administrator of Policy.
