SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We encourage written comments and 
suggestions from the public and affected agencies concerning the 
proposed information collection. Your comments should address one or 
more of the following four points:

--Evaluate whether the proposed information collection is necessary to 
properly perform ATF's functions, including whether the information 
will have practical utility;
--Evaluate the agency's estimate of the proposed information 
collection's burden for accuracy, including validity of the methodology 
and assumptions used;
--Evaluate whether, and if so, how, the quality, utility, and clarity 
of the collected information can be enhanced; and
--Minimize the information collection's burden on those who are to 
respond, including using appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, 
or other technological collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology, e.g., permitting people to submit electronic 
responses.

    Abstract: To protect the public from misuse of explosives, 
implementing regulations at 27 CFR 555.109 require licensees/permittees 
to mark certain explosives they manufacture or import, as well as mark 
immediate containers and outside packaging. The markings must include 
certain information and be clear and permanent, though they can be done 
via sticky label, marker, etc. Some types of explosives are too small 
or too fluid to be marked, or in a form that cannot be marked, and are 
therefore excepted from the marking requirements.

Revisions to This Information Collection

    This information collection, OMB control number 1140-0055, 
previously covered only manufacturer markings, and another information 
collection, 1140-0062, covered importer markings. However, to 
streamline the two information collections and eliminate redundancies 
that have evolved, ATF has decided to combine the two ICRs and has 
slightly revised the title to no longer limit it to manufacturers. ICR 
1140-0055 is now the resulting combined ICR. In addition, the number of 
licensees/permittees in both groups has decreased a small amount since 
the last renewal for each ICR, for a combined decrease in licensees/
permittees from 2,066 to 2,054, or a decrease of 12. In addition, ATF 
has updated the ICR to account for only the portion of these licensees/
permittees that actually manufacture or import and distribute the kinds 
of explosives they are required to mark, which is five percent of the 
total licensees/permittees registered to manufacture or import, 
resulting in a further decrease in respondents affected by this 
information collection to 103 total. Consequently, the total responses 
and burden hours have also decreased due to the reduced number of 
respondents, from 895 hours to 45, or a reduction of 850 hours. In 
addition, due to a new request by OMB, the agency is including in the 
ICR a monetized value for the time, which it had not included in 
previous ICRs.
    If additional information is required, contact: Darwin Arceo, 
Department Clearance Officer; United States Department of Justice; 
Justice Management Division, Enterprise Portfolio Management; Two 
Constitution Square, 145 N Street NE, 4W-218; Washington, DC.

    Dated: November 25, 2025.

Department Clearance Officer for PRA, U.S. Department of Justice.
