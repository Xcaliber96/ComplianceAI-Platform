SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Contents

    This notice sets out a summary of the use and burden associated 
with the following information collections. More detailed information 
can be found in each collection's supporting statement and associated 
materials (see ADDRESSES).
    Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), federal agencies must obtain 
approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for each 
collection of information they conduct or sponsor. The term 
``collection of information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 
1320.3(c) and includes agency requests or requirements that members of 
the public submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a 
third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA requires federal agencies 
to publish a 60-day notice in the Federal Register concerning each 
proposed collection of information, including each proposed extension 
or reinstatement of an existing collection of information, before 
submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To comply with this 
requirement, CMS is publishing this notice.

Information Collections

    1. Type of Information Collection Request: Reinstatement without 
change of a previously approved collection; Title of Information 
Collection: Conditions of Participation for Psychiatric Residential 
Treatment Facilities' (PRTFs) Use of Restraint & Seclusion; Use: We are 
requesting reinstatement of the previously approved information 
collection. This collection supports CMS's oversight of the use of 
involuntary ``restraint'' and ``seclusion''--interventions used to 
manage patients who pose a danger to themselves or others, in 
psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs) that serve 
individuals under age 21. As authorized under the Social Security Act, 
the Medicaid program allows federal funding available for state 
expenditures under an approved State Medicaid plan for inpatient 
psychiatric services in both hospital and non-hospital settings. Non-
hospital settings, defined as PRTFs, serve individuals under age 21 
with psychiatric conditions that require physician-directed inpatient 
care in a residential setting.
    The requirements under 42 CFR Sec.  483.350 et seq. are used by CMS 
to monitor compliance in Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities 
(PRTFs). Compliance is assessed by state surveyors through on-site 
surveys and is used to determine a facility's eligibility for Medicare 
certification and re-certification. PRTFs are typically surveyed at 
least once every six years. Form Number: CMS-R-306 (OMB control number: 
0938-0833); Frequency: Occasionally; Affected Public: Private sector 
(Business or other for-profits); Number of Respondents: 366; Total 
Annual Responses: 1,376,621; Total Annual Hours: 439,623. (For policy 
questions regarding this collection contact Claudia Molinar at 410-786-
8445.)
