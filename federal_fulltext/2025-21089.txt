POSTAL SERVICE

39 CFR Part 20


International Registered Mail

AGENCY: Postal Service.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Postal Service is revising Mailing Standards of the United 
States Postal Service, International Mail Manual (IMM[supreg]), and 
Notice 123, Price List, to reflect changes to international Registered 
Mail as established by the Governors of the United States Postal 
Service.

DATES: Effective: January 1, 2026.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dale Kennedy at 202-268-6592 or 
Michelle Lassiter 202-268-2914.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: During the October 2023 Universal Postal 
Union (UPU) Extraordinary Congress, the decision was made to revise the 
Universal Postal Convention to limit the availability of international 
Registered Mail to letter-post items containing documents only, 
effective January 1, 2026.
    On October 14, 2025, the Postal Service filed a notice in Postal 
Regulatory Commission (PRC) Docket No. MC2026-21, which the PRC 
favorably reviewed on November 5, 2025, in Order No. 9333, regarding 
the termination of international Registered Mail as an extra service 
for First-Class Package International Service[supreg], effective 
January 1, 2026. International Registered Mail service will continue to 
be available for First-Class Mail International[supreg] letters when 
Registered Mail is purchased as an extra service. This order is 
available on the PRC website at <a href="https://www.prc.gov">https://www.prc.gov</a>.
    These IMM revisions implement changes associated with the 
termination of outbound international Registered Mail as an extra 
service for the following:
    [ssquf] First-Class Package International Service.
    [ssquf] Free Matter for the Blind First-Class Package International 
Service.
    The Postal Service hereby adopts the following changes to Mailing 
Standards of the United States Postal Service,
