SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[OMB Control No. 3235-0738]


Agency Information Collection Activities; Proposed Collection; 
Comment Request; Extension: Rules 13n-4(b)(9), (b)(10) and (d)

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. Sec.  3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC or ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
proposed collection of information.
    Rules 13n-4(b)(9), (b)(10) and (d) implement Exchange Act sections 
13(n)(5)(G) and (H), which conditionally require a security-based swap 
data repository (``SBSDR'') registered with the Commission to make 
available security-based swap data obtained by the SBSDR (``SBS Data'') 
to certain U.S. government entities and any other person that the 
Commission determines to be appropriate. The rules, in part, condition 
such sharing of SBS Data on there being an arrangement between the 
Commission and the relevant entity (in the form of a memorandum of 
understanding or otherwise) to address the confidentiality of the SBS 
Data. The rules further require SBSDRs to create and maintain records 
regarding such data access. Pursuant to the Commission's authority, 
regulators or other authorities that are not otherwise designated by 
statute or rule may request from the Commission that they be deemed 
eligible to access SBS Data.
    Implementation of the statutory and regulatory SBS Data access 
provisions--including the confidentiality condition and the 
Commission's authority to designate entities to access SBS Data--
facilitates regulatory oversight of the security-based swap market and 
its participants, including oversight of systemic and other risks 
associated with the market. Implementation also promotes compliance 
with applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to 
compliance with the antifraud provisions of the federal securities 
laws.
    Commission staff estimates that the total annual burden associated 
with Rules 13n-4(b)(9), (b)(10) and (d) is 11,405 hours and $120,000, 
calculated as follows:
    Commission staff estimates a total of 50 regulators or other 
authorities will enter into confidentiality arrangements with the 
Commission to obtain access to SBS Data pursuant to these provisions. 
On average, each of those recipients of data is expected to expend 500 
hours in connection with negotiating these MOUs or other arrangements, 
for a one-time aggregate burden of 25,000 hours, with no associated 
ongoing burdens. This equates to 8,333 hours per year when annualized 
over three years.
    Commission staff estimates that a total of 41 regulators or other 
authorities (that otherwise are not identified by statute or the rules 
as being eligible for access to SBS Data) may request that the 
Commission determine they are eligible to access SBS Data. On average, 
each of those entities is expected to expend 40 hours in connection 
with such requests, for a one-time aggregate burden of 1,640 hours, 
with no associated ongoing burdens. This equates to 547 hours per year 
when annualized over three years.
    Commission staff also estimates that a total of three SBSDRs may be 
expected to incur systems-related costs associated with setting up 
access to SBS Data for regulators and other authorities. On average, 
each SBSDR is expected to expend 1,300 hours in connection with 
providing such connectivity (based on each SBSDR incurring 26 hours per 
recipient, for 50 total recipients), for a one-time aggregate burden of 
3,900 hours, with no associated ongoing burdens. This equates to 1,300 
hours when annualized over three years.
    In addition, Commission staff estimates that a total of three 
SBSDRs may incur costs associated with the requirement to notify the 
Commission when an SBSDR receives the first request for SBS Data from a 
particular entity. On average, each SBSDR is expected to expend 25 
hours in connection with this notice requirement (based on each SBSDR 
providing 50 notices, at half-hour per notice), for a one-time 
aggregate burden of 75 hours, with no associated ongoing burdens. This 
equates to 25 hours per year when annualized over three years.
    Commission staff estimates that a total of three SBSDRs may incur 
costs associated with the requirement that an SBSDR maintain records of 
all information related to initial and subsequent requests for SBS Data 
access. On average, compliance with this provision is expected to 
require 360 hours initially and 280 hours annually per SBSDR, for a 
total burden of 1,080 hours initially and 840 hours annually across 
three SBSDRs. This equates to 1,200 hours per year when annualized over 
three years. Commission staff further estimates that each of the three 
SBSDRs will require $40,000 annually in connection with that 
requirement, for a total cost of $120,000 annually across three SBSDRs.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB Control Number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the SEC, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the SEC's estimate of the burden 
imposed by the proposed collection of information, including the 
validity of the methodology and the assumptions used; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated, 
electronic collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology.

Notice to Austin Gerig, Director/Chief Data Officer, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, c/o Tanya Ruttenberg via email to
