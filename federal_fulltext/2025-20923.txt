[Project No. 15380-000]


Robertson Power Company, LLC; Notice Extending Comment Period

    On October 31, 2024, Robertson Power Company, LLC, filed an 
application for a preliminary permit, pursuant to section 4(f) of the 
Federal Power Act (FPA), proposing to study the feasibility of the 
Somersworth Mill Hydroelectric Project No. 15380-000 (project), to be 
located at the Somersworth Mill dam on the Salmon Falls River near the 
Town of Somersworth in Strafford County, New Hampshire, and Berwick, 
York County, Maine.
    On October 15, 2025, the Commission issued public notice of the 
application and established December 15, 2025, as the deadline for 
filing comments, interventions, and competing applications. However, 
the Commission's October 15, 2025 notice was inadvertently not 
distributed to all parties required to be notified pursuant to the 
Commission's regulations [18 CFR 4.32(a)(2)]. Therefore, we are 
extending the deadline for filing comments, interventions, and 
competing applications until on or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 
January 5, 2026.
    More information about this project, including a copy of the 
application and a copy of the Commission's October 25, 2025 notice, can
