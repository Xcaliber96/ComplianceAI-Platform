II. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility 
Operating Licenses and Combined Licenses and Proposed No Significant 
Hazards Consideration Determination

    For the facility-specific amendment requests shown in this notice, 
the Commission finds that the licensees' analyses provided, consistent 
with section 50.91 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR) ``Notice for public comment; State consultation,'' are sufficient 
to support the proposed determinations that these amendment requests 
involve NSHC. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, 
operation of the facilities in accordance with the proposed amendments 
would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the 
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident 
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety.
    The Commission is seeking public comments on these proposed 
determinations. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determinations.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue any of these license amendments before expiration 
of the 60-day period provided that its final determination is that the 
amendment involves NSHC. In addition, the Commission may issue any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of the 30-day comment period 
if circumstances change during the 30-day comment period such that 
failure to act in a timely way would result, for example in derating or 
shutdown of the facility. If the Commission takes action on any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of either the comment period 
or the notice period, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice 
of issuance. If the Commission makes a final NSHC determination for any 
of these amendments, any hearing will take place after issuance. The 
Commission expects that the need to take action on any amendment before 
60 days have elapsed will occur very infrequently.

A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be

[[Page 53398]]

affected by any of these actions may file a request for a hearing and 
petition for leave to intervene (petition) with respect to that action. 
Petitions shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Agency 
Rules of Practice and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons 
should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, 
the Commission or a presiding officer will rule on the petition and, if 
appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested, and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (<a href="https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053">https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053</a>) and on the NRC's public website 
at <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate">https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate</a>.

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056), and on the NRC's public website 
(<a href="https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html">https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html</a>).
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#38705d594a51565f167c575b535d4c78564a5b165f574e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9fd7fafeedf6f1f8b1dbf0fcf4faebdff1edfcb1f8f0e9">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to: (1) request a digital identification 
(ID) certificate which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html">https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html</a>. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket is created, the participant must submit 
adjudicatory documents in the Portable Document Format. Guidance on 
submissions is available on the NRC's public website at <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html">https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html</a>. A filing is 
considered complete at the time the document is submitted through the 
NRC's E-Filing system. To be timely, an electronic filing must be 
submitted to the E-Filing system no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due 
date. Upon receipt of a transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps 
the document and sends the submitter an email confirming receipt of the 
document. The E-Filing system also distributes an email that provides 
access to the document to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and 
any others who have advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish 
to participate in the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the 
document on those participants separately. Therefore, applicants and 
other participants (or their counsel or representative) must apply for 
and receive a digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are 
filed in order to obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing 
system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html">https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html</a>, by 
email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d69b859e92f884b3a5b9a3a4b5b396b8a4b5f8b1b9a0"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2d607e6569037f485e42585f4e486d435f4e034a425b">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at <a href="https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd">https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd</a>, unless otherwise excluded pursuant to an order of 
the presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal

[[Page 53399]]

privacy information such as social security numbers, home addresses, or 
personal phone numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or 
other law requires submission of such information. With respect to 
copyrighted works, except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose 
of the adjudicatory filings and would constitute a Fair Use 
application, participants should not include copyrighted materials in 
their submission.

III. Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses 
and Combined Licenses

    During the period since publication of the last monthly notice, the 
Commission has issued the following amendments. The Commission has 
determined for each of these amendments that the application complies 
with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The 
Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the 
Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set 
forth in the license amendment.
    A notice of consideration of issuance of amendment to facility 
operating license or combined license, as applicable, proposed NSHC 
determination, and opportunity for a hearing in connection with these 
actions, was published in the Federal Register as indicated in the 
safety evaluation for each amendment.
    Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that 
these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in 
accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), 
no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an 
environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 
10 CFR 51.22(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, 
it is so indicated in the safety evaluation for the amendment.
    For further details with respect to each action, see the amendment 
and associated documents such as the Commission's letter and safety 
evaluation, which may be obtained using the ADAMS accession numbers 
indicated in the following table. The safety evaluation will provide 
the ADAMS accession numbers for the application for amendment and the 
Federal Register citation for any environmental assessment. All of 
these items can be accessed as described in the ``Obtaining Information 
and Submitting Comments'' section of this document.
