DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

Federal Aviation Administration

[Docket No. FAA-2025-0780]


Agency Information Collection Activities: Requests for Comments; 
Clearance of a Renewed Approval of Information Collection: Service 
Availability Prediction Tool (SAPT)

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Notice and request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA 
invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information 
collection. The collection involves planned routes of flight and 
aircraft avionics equipment. The information to be collected will be 
used to predict whether an aircraft flying the proposed route of flight 
will have sufficient position accuracy and integrity for the following: 
Navigation, via the Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) 
SAPT; Surveillance, via the Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast 
(ADS-B) SAPT. In addition, the website will allow operators to request 
authorization to operate in ADS-B-Out rule airspace with aircraft that 
do not fully meet the ADS-B Out requirements via: ADS-B Deviation 
Authorization Pre-flight Tool (ADAPT).

DATES: Written comments should be submitted by January 27, 2026.

ADDRESSES: Please send written comments:

[[Page 54840]]

information is necessary for FAA's performance; (b) the accuracy of the 
estimated burden; (c) ways for FAA to enhance the quality, utility and 
clarity of the information collection; and (d) ways that the burden 
could be minimized without reducing the quality of the collected 
information. The agency will summarize and/or include your comments in 
the request for OMB's clearance of this information collection.
    OMB Control Number: 2120-0780.
    Title: Service Availability Prediction Tool (SAPT).
    Form Numbers: eXtensible markup language (XML) format, ADS-B SAPT 
flight information entry form, and ADS-B authorization request at 
<a href="https://sapt.faa.gov">https://sapt.faa.gov</a>.
    Type of Review: Renewal of an information collection.
    Background:
    Under 14 CFR 91.103, pilots must use all available information in 
planning their flight. SAPT is a web-based tool to assist aircraft 
operators in achieving compliance with the requirements of 14 CFR 
91.103, 91.225. and 91.227, and/or AC 90-100A Change 2, Paragraph 10a. 
(5). To ensure that they will meet the performance requirements for the 
duration of the flight, pilots may use the FAA-provided pre-flight 
Service Availability Prediction Tool (SAPT) to determine predicted 
navigation or surveillance availability before a flight. The SAPT has 
three main components: the Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring 
(RAIM) SAPT, the ADS-B SAPT, and the ADS-B Deviation Authorization Pre-
Flight Tool (ADAPT). The SAPT models the GPS constellation in order to 
assess the predicted accuracy and integrity of GPS position information 
used in navigation and surveillance for a few GPS receiver Technical 
Standard Orders (TSOs).
    The RAIM SAPT is intended mainly for pilots, dispatchers, and 
commercial operators using TSO-C129 equipment to check their predicted 
navigation horizontal protection level (HPL). It incorporates TSO-C129 
GPS RAIM predictions to check the availability of GPS RAIM satisfying 
the RNAV requirements of AC 90-100A Change 2, Paragraph 10(5)).
    The ADS-B SAPT is provided to help operators comply with 14 CFR 
91.225 and 91.227 by predicting whether operators will meet regulatory 
requirements.
    Information collected via ADS-B SAPT is comparable to that provided 
by pilots when they file flight plans, with some additional information 
about aircraft position source TSO and related capabilities. The ADS-B 
SAPT prediction is based on the ability of the aircraft's position 
source (i.e., GPS receiver) to meet performance requirements specified 
in FAA TSOs C129, C129a, C145c/C146c, and C196, as well as the 
predicted status of the GPS constellation.
    The ADS-B SAPT predicts whether GPS position information will be 
sufficient throughout the flight to meet the performance requirements 
of 14 CFR 91.227(c)(1)(i) and (iii). If a waypoint is in rule airspace 
and the aircraft's position source is not predicted to meet the 
performance requirements of 14 CFR 91.227, the ADS-B SAPT checks for 
the availability of back-up surveillance at that waypoint.
    Operators of aircraft equipped with TSO-C129 (SA-On) GPS receivers 
must run a pre-flight prediction. The operator may use their own 
prediction tool.
    ADAPT is mandatory for operators desiring to apply for an ATC 
authorization, per 14 CFR 91.225(g), to fly in ADS-B Out rule airspace 
using aircraft with avionics that do not meet the ADS-B equipage 
requirements. ADAPT allows operators to create an air traffic 
authorization request to operate in ADS-B Out rule airspace when (1) 
the aircraft is without ADS-B equipment; (2) that equipment is 
inoperative; or (3) their avionics are not expected to meet the ADS-B 
performance requirements as identified in 14 CFR 91.227(c)(1)(i) and 
(iii). Operators who wish to submit an ADAPT request must complete the 
ADS-B SAPT analysis using information entered into the flight 
information entry form before filing the ADAPT request.

Information Collected

    Information collected by SAPT is comparable to that provided in FAA 
flight plans, with some additional information about the position 
source. The ADS-B SAPT flight information entry form requires the 
aircraft call sign but does not collect other personal identification 
information about the operator. ADAPT does collect personal information 
to include name, telephone number, email address. The information is 
necessary to enable the FAA ATC Authorization Authority (AAA) to reply 
with either an approval, rejection, or pending decision. It also 
collects additional information about the flight, including US Civil 
Aircraft Registry Number or ICAO Address.

Respondents

    These prediction tools are primarily intended for pilots and 
dispatchers; and for anyone who is planning a flight which passes 
through U.S. sovereign airspace, using an aircraft whose GPS 
receiver(s) is/are not guaranteed to meet certain performance 
requirements or whose aircraft is not equipped to meet the requirements 
of 14 CFR 91.225. Since SAPT does not collect personal information from 
either ADS-B SAPT or RAIM users, we do not have transactions assigned 
to individual respondents.

Frequency

    As part of the flight planning process, as required by FAA policy. 
Predictions are made in evaluating a route of flight, which may be more 
than one route per flight. We estimate that the total 2026 levels will 
be:
    Automated transactions, requiring insignificant effort per 
transaction:

<bullet> RAIM SAPT--3,792,901
<bullet> ADS-B SAPT--9,667,021

    Manual web transactions:

<bullet> ADS-B SAPT Web Form--18,102 transactions, approximately 885 
hours.
<bullet> ADAPT--4,823 transactions, including DoD/military, which takes 
approximately 344 hours.

Estimated Average Burden per Response

    RAIM SAPT and ADS-B SAPT can be automated as part of the dispatch 
process by operators or flight service providers, thus eliminating 
manual data-entry.
    RAIM SAPT--Insignificant, as all transactions are automated in 
flight planning systems.
    ADS-B SAPT--5 minutes or less for transactions entered in the 
flight plan form.
    ADAPT--7 minutes or less (includes up to 2 minutes to check FAA 
email response).

Estimated Total Annual Burden

    Cumulative total burden for 2026:
    RAIM SAPT--Insignificant additional burden.
    ADS-B SAPT--Approximately 1,207 hours (for reporting) and 302 hours 
(for record-keeping).
    ADAPT--Approximately 402 hours (for reporting) and 80 hours (for 
record-keeping).
