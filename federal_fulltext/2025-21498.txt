    OMB Control Number: 1810-0693.
    Type of Review: Extension without change to a currently approved

    Abstract: Section 8521(a) of the Elementary and Secondary Education 
Act of 1965, as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESEA) 
provides that a local educational agency (LEA) may receive funds under 
Title I, Part A and other ESEA ``covered programs'' for any fiscal year 
only if the State educational agency (SEA) finds that either the 
combined fiscal effort per student or the aggregate expenditures of the 
LEA and the State with respect to the provision of free public 
education by the LEA for the preceding fiscal year was not less than 90 
percent of the combined fiscal effort or aggregate expenditures for the 
second preceding fiscal year. This provision is the maintenance of 
effort (MOE) requirements for LEAs under the ESEA. If an LEA fails to 
meet the MOE requirement, under section 8521(b) of the ESEA, the SEA 
must reduce the amount of funds allocated under the programs covered by 
the MOE requirement in any fiscal year in the exact proportion by which 
the LEA fails to maintain effort by falling below 90 percent of either 
the combined fiscal effort per student or aggregate expenditures, if 
the LEA has also failed to maintain effort for 1 or more of the 5 
immediately preceding fiscal years. In reducing an LEA's allocation 
because it failed to meet the MOE requirement, the SEA uses the measure 
most favorable to the LEA. Section 8521(c) gives the U.S. Department of 
Education (ED) the authority to waive the ESEA's MOE requirement for an 
LEA if it would be equitable to grant the waiver due to an exceptional 
or uncontrollable circumstance such as a natural disaster or a change 
in the organizational structure of the LEA or a precipitous decline in 
the LEA's financial resources. If an MOE waiver is granted, the 
reduction required by section 8521(b) does not occur for that year. A 
request for a waiver of the MOE requirement is discretionary. Only an 
LEA that has failed to maintain effort and that believes its failure 
justifies a waiver would request one. To review an MOE waiver request, 
ED relies primarily on expenditure, revenue, and other data relevant to 
an LEA's request provided by the SEA. To assist an SEA with submitting 
this information, ED developed an MOE waiver form as part of the 2009 
Title I, Part A Waiver Guidance, which covered a range of waivers that 
ED invited at that time. The purpose of this request is to renew 
approval for the MOE waiver form. This collection includes burden at 
the SEA level.
