SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the extended collection of 
information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of 
the agency, including whether the information shall have practical 
utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; (c) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways 
to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, 
including through the use of automated collection techniques or other 
forms of information technology.
    This information collection request contains:
    (1) OMB No.: 1910-5137;
    (2) Information Collection Request Title: Application for Loans 
under the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program;
    (3) Type of Review: Extension without change of a currently 
approved collection;
    (4) Purpose: The ATVM Program is implemented pursuant to Section 
136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, as amended. 42 
U.S.C. 17013. The ATVM Program provides loans to eligible applicants 
for projects that reequip, expand, or establish manufacturing 
facilities in the United States to produce qualified advanced 
technology vehicles, qualified components, or ultra efficient vehicles; 
and for associated engineering integration costs. DOE set forth 
regulations at 10 CFR part 611 to implement the ATVM Program, and 
established application requirements. This information collection 
request covers the information necessary to evaluate those 
applications. The collected information will be used to analyze whether 
an applicant and its project is eligible for a loan under the ATVM 
Program. The collection of this information is critical to ensure that 
the government has sufficient information to determine whether 
applicants meet the eligibility requirements to qualify for an ATVM 
loan and to provide DOE with sufficient information to evaluate an 
applicant's project using the criteria specified in 10 CFR part 611;
    (5) Annual Estimated Number of Respondents: 20;
    (6) Annual Estimated Number of Total Responses: 20;

$33,711.

Security Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-140), as amended (and codified at 42 
U.S.C. 17013(d)(2)).
