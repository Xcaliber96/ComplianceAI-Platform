SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. What information is EPA particularly interested in?

    Pursuant to PRA section 3506(c)(2)(A) (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)), 
EPA specifically solicits comments and information to enable it to:
    1. Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Agency, 
including whether the information will have practical utility.
    2. Evaluate the accuracy of the Agency's estimates of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used.
    3. Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected.
    4. Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those 
who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated 
electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic 
submission of responses. In particular, EPA is requesting comments from 
very small businesses (those that employ less than 25) on examples of 
specific additional efforts that EPA could make to reduce the paperwork 
burden for very small businesses affected by this collection.

II. What information collection activity or ICR does this action apply 
to?

    Title: Consolidated Pesticide Registration Submission Portal.
    EPA ICR No.: 2624.02.
    OMB Control No.: 2070-0226.
    ICR Status: This ICR is currently approved through July 31, 2026. 
Under the PRA, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is 
not required to respond to, a collection of information, unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control numbers 
for EPA's regulations in title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR), after appearing in the Federal Register when approved, are 
displayed either by publication in the Federal Register or by other 
appropriate means, such as on the related collection instrument or 
form, if applicable. The display of OMB control numbers for certain EPA 
regulations is consolidated in 40 CFR part 9.
    Abstract: This ICR covers pesticide registration collection 
activities supporting the statutorily mandated pesticide registration 
program under the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act 
(FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) as amended 
by the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). Such activities include 
pesticide registration, pesticide use, pesticide sale and distribution, 
pesticide permitting activities, determinations regarding whether a 
product must be regulated under FIFRA or Pesticide Tolerances all which 
are submitted electronically through the Agency's Central Data Exchange 
(CDX) system.
    The ICR, which is available in the docket along with other related 
materials, provides a detailed explanation of the collection activities 
and the burden estimate that is only briefly summarized here:
    Form number(s): 8570-1, 8570-4, 8570-5, 8570-17, 8570-25, 8570-27, 
8570-34, 8570-35, 8570-36 and 8570-37.
    Respondents/affected entities: Entities potentially affected by 
this ICR include Pesticide and other agricultural chemical 
manufacturing, research, and development in the physical, engineering, 
and life sciences, biological products (except diagnostic) 
manufacturing, colleges, universities, and professional schools, farm 
supplies

wholesalers, flower, nursery stock, and florist's supplies wholesalers, 
state government, other chemical and allied product merchant 
wholesalers, exterminating and pest control service, management, 
scientific, and technical consulting services. North American 
Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes identified in question 
12 of the ICR.
    Respondent's obligation to respond: Mandatory. FIFRA and FFDCA.
    Estimated number of potential respondents: 15,023.
    Frequency of response: On occasion.
    Total estimated average number of responses for each respondent: 
Between 1 to 74.
    Total estimated burden: 2,234,433 hours (per year). Burden is 
defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b).
    Total estimated costs: $172,873,497 (per year), includes $0 
annualized capital investment or maintenance and operational costs.

III. Are there changes in the estimates from the last approval?

    There is an increase of 59,385 hours in the total estimated 
respondent burden compared with that identified in the ICR currently 
approved by OMB. This increase reflects EPA's updating of burden 
estimates for this collection based upon historical information on the 
number of responses anticipated for some ICs and the inclusion of an 
additional prior ICR titled, ``Exemptions of Certain Plant Incorporated 
Protectants (PIPs) Derived from Newer Technologies'' (OMB Control No. 
2070-0214; Rulemaking RIN-2070-AK54). Based upon revised estimates and 
the inclusion of an additional IC, the total number of responses 
anticipated across categories has increased by 32,627 with a 
corresponding increase in the associated burden hours. While burden 
hours increased, the annual total costs to respondents have decreased 
due to a program change to reflect updated guidance on the calculation 
of overhead in fully loaded wages. This change is the result of a 
program change.

IV. What is the next step in the process for this ICR?

    EPA will consider the comments received and amend the ICR as 
appropriate. The final ICR package will then be submitted to OMB for 
review and approval pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.12. EPA will issue another 
Federal Register document pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.5(a)(1)(iv) to 
announce the submission of the ICR to OMB and the opportunity to submit 
additional comments to OMB. If you have any questions about this ICR or 
the approval process, please contact the person listed under FOR 
FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.
    Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

Pollution Prevention.
