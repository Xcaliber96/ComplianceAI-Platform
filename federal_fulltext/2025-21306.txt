ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

40 CFR Part 62

[EPA-R04-OAR-2024-0171, FRL-11883-02-R4]


Delegation of Authority to North Carolina and Forsyth County of 
the Federal Plan for Existing Landfills

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing 
notification that it has approved requests from the state of North 
Carolina, submitted through the North Carolina Department of 
Environmental Quality (NCDEQ), and the Forsyth County Office of 
Environmental Assistance and Protection (FCOEAP or District) for the 
delegation of authority to implement and enforce the Federal Plan 
Requirements for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) landfills that commenced 
construction on or before July 17, 2014, and have not been modified or 
reconstructed since July 17, 2014 (Federal Plan). The memorandum of 
agreement (MOA) between NCDEQ and EPA took effect on September 30, 
2024, upon the signature of the EPA Region 4 Acting Regional 
Administrator. Similarly, the MOA between FCOEAP and EPA became 
effective on July 19, 2024, upon the same signature. The Federal Plan 
addresses the implementation and enforcement of the emission guidelines 
(EG) applicable to existing MSW landfills located in areas not covered 
by an approved and currently effective state plan. The Federal Plan 
imposes emission limits and other control requirements which will 
reduce designated pollutants for existing affected MSW landfills. The 
purpose of these delegations is to transfer primary implementation and 
enforcement responsibilities from EPA to NCDEQ and FCOEAP for existing 
affected MSW landfills. This document informs the public of the MOAs 
and amends regulatory text at 40 CFR subpart 62 to reflect these 
delegations.

DATES: This final rule is effective on December 26, 2025.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    On May 21, 2021, EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register 
at 86 FR 27756 to promulgate the Federal Plan Requirements for MSW 
landfills that commenced construction on or before July 17, 2014, and 
have not been modified or reconstructed since July 17, 2014. This 
Federal Plan is codified at 40 CFR part 62, subpart OOO. The Federal 
Plan in subpart OOO implements EG and Compliance Times for Municipal 
MSW Landfills (2016 MSW Landfills EG). EPA finalized the 2016 MSW 
Landfills EG on August 29, 2016. 81 FR 59276. The 2016 MSW Landfills EG 
is codified at 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cf. The Federal Plan 
applicability criteria in subpart OOO, at 40 CFR 62.16711, reflect 
those established by the 2016 MSW Landfills EG at 40 CFR 60.31f. See 86 
FR 27756, 27762. The 2016 MSW Landfills EG and the Federal Plan apply 
to MSW landfills that have accepted waste at any time since November 8, 
1987, and commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or 
before July 17, 2014.
    The Clean Air Act (CAA or Act), 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq., requires 
states with existing MSW landfills subject to the 2016 MSW Landfills EG 
to submit state plans to EPA in order to implement and enforce the EG. 
For states without an approved plan, CAA section 111 and 40 CFR 
60.27(c) and (d) direct EPA to develop, implement, and enforce a 
Federal Plan for existing MSW landfills. The Federal Plan applies in 
areas without an approved state plan by requiring existing MSW 
landfills that reach a landfill gas emission threshold of 34 megagrams 
(Mg) of nonmethane organic compounds (NMOC) or more per year to install 
a system to collect and control landfill gas. Other requirements 
include but are not limited to, presumptive emission limits, compliance 
schedules, testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping.
    The final rule promulgating the Federal Plan established how a 
state can request delegation of the Federal Plan for implementation and 
enforcement authority on behalf of EPA. See at 86 FR 27756, 27766.

II. Submittal and EPA Approval of Requests for Delegation of the 
Federal Plan

    EPA evaluates requests for delegation of the MSW Federal Plan 
pursuant to the provisions of the MSW Federal Plan and the EPA's 
Delegations Manual. Pursuant to the MSW Federal Plan, a state may meet 
its CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations by submitting an acceptable 
written request for delegation of the Federal Plan that includes the 
following elements: (1) a demonstration of adequate resources and legal 
authority to administer and enforce the Federal Plan; (2) an inventory 
of affected MSW units, an inventory of emissions from affected MSW 
units, and provisions for state progress reports; (3) certification 
that the state held a hearing on the state delegation request; and (4) 
a commitment to enter into a MOA with

[[Page 54239]]

the Regional Administrator that sets forth the terms, conditions, and 
effective date of the delegation and that serves as the mechanism for 
the transfer of authority. See at 78 FR 28052. Both NCDEQ and FCOEAP 
documented that they met delegation requirements (1) through (3) in 
letters to EPA dated November 28, 2023, and April 2, 2024, 
respectively, which are included in the docket for this action, as well 
as requirement (4), which is addressed in the following paragraphs of 
this preamble.
    Pursuant to EPA's Delegations Manual, item 7-139, Implementation 
and Enforcement of 111(d)(2) and 111(d)(2)/129(b)(3) Federal plans, a 
copy of which is included in the docket for this action, the Regional 
Administrator is authorized to delegate authority to implement and 
enforce section 111(d)/129 Federal plans to states. The requirements 
and limitations of a delegation agreement are set forth in item 7-139 
of the Delegations Manual. Consistent with those requirements, both 
NCDEQ and FCOEAP entered into separate MOAs with EPA which set forth 
the terms, conditions, and effective date of the delegation and that 
serve as the mechanism for the transfer of authority. For the state of 
North Carolina, the MOA was signed by the NCDEQ Secretary on August 2, 
2024, and became effective upon signature of EPA Region 4 Acting 
Regional Administrator on September 30, 2024. FCOEAP's MOA was signed 
by FCOEAP's Director on June 26, 2024, and became effective upon 
signature of EPA Region 4 Acting Regional Administrator on July 19, 
2024. Thus, both entities agree to the terms and conditions of the MOA 
and accept responsibility for implementation and enforcement of the 
policies and procedures of the Federal Plan, except for certain 
authorities that are retained by EPA (authority to approve major 
alternatives to test methods or monitoring, authority to approve 
alternative methods to determine the site-specific NMOC concentration 
or a site-specific methane generation rate constant, etc.). EPA 
continues to retain concurrent enforcement authority. Both MOAs are 
included in the docket for this action.
    EPA evaluates requests for delegation of the MSW Federal Plan for 
consistency with the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA policy. The State of 
North Carolina and FCOEAP met all the requirements for the delegation 
of authority to implement and enforce the Federal Plan for existing MSW 
Landfills. Accordingly, EPA is codifying approval of both North 
Carolina's request dated November 28, 2023, and FCOEAP's request dated 
April 2, 2024, for the delegation of authority of the Federal Plan.

III. EPA Action

    In this action, EPA is amending the regulatory text at 40 CFR part 
62, subpart II--North Carolina, to reflect the approved delegations of 
authority for implementing and enforcing the Federal Plan through MOAs 
with the NCDEQ and the FCOEAP, respectively.

IV. Good Cause Finding

    Section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires 
publication of notice of proposed rulemaking and specifies what the 
notice shall include. See 5 U.S.C. 553(b). However, the APA provides an 
exception from this requirement ``when the agency for good cause finds 
(and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor 
in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure thereon are 
impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' See 5 
U.S.C. 553(b)(B).
    EPA finds good cause for making this action final without prior 
proposal and opportunity for comment because this action merely amends 
40 CFR part 62 to reflect that EPA previously signed MOAs delegating 
authority to NCDEQ and FCOEAP. The MOAs delegating authority to 
implement and enforce the Federal Plan became effective on the dates 
they were signed by the EPA Region 4 Acting Regional Administrator--on 
September 30, 2024, for NCDEQ and July 19, 2024, for FCOEAP. This 
action does not alter the universe of sources regulated under the 
Federal Plan, nor does it change the regulatory requirements applicable 
to those sources nor EPA's authority to enforce such requirements. In 
these circumstances, notice and comment procedures are ``unnecessary'' 
under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).

V. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

    Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a 111(d)/
129 plan submission that complies with the provisions of the CAA and 
applicable Federal regulations. CAA sections 111(d) and 129(b); 40 CFR 
part 60, subparts B and Cf; and 40 CFR part 62, subpart A; and 40 CFR 
62.04. In reviewing 111(d)/129 Federal Plan delegation requests, EPA's 
role is to approve state choices, provided that they meet the criteria 
of the CAA and of EPA's implementing regulations. Accordingly, this 
action merely codifies in the Code of Federal Regulations EPA's 
delegation of authority to implement the Federal Plan and does not 
impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by the already-
applicable Federal Plan. For that reason, this proposed action:
    <bullet> Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' subject to 
review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 
12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993).
    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, 
February 6, 2025) because approvals of NSPS delegations are exempt from 
review under Executive Order 12866;
    <bullet> Does not impose an information collection burden under the 
provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.);
    <bullet> Is certified as not having a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.);
    <bullet> Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);
    <bullet> Does not have Federalism implications as specified in 
Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);
    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, 
April 23, 1997) because it approves a state program;
    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to 
Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and
    <bullet> Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the 
National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 
note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent 
with the CAA.
    In addition, this proposed rulemaking action, pertaining to NCDEQ's 
and FCOEAP's submissions, is not approved to apply on any Indian 
reservation land or in any other area where EPA or an Indian tribe has 
demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian 
country, the rule does not have Tribal implications and will not impose 
any substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal 
law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 
2000).
