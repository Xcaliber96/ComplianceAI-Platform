[Document Identifier: CMS-10398 #43]


Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Generic 
Information Collection Activities: Proposed Collection; Comment Request

AGENCY: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Health and Human 
Services (HHS).

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: On May 28, 2010, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
issued Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) guidance related to the 
``generic'' clearance process. Generally, this is an expedited process 
by which agencies may obtain OMB's approval of collection of 
information requests that are ``usually voluntary, low-burden, and 
uncontroversial collections,'' do not raise any substantive or policy 
issues, and do not require policy or methodological review. The process 
requires the submission of an overarching plan that defines the scope 
of the individual collections that would fall under its umbrella. On 
October 23, 2011, OMB approved our initial request to use the generic 
clearance process under control number 0938-1148 (CMS-10398). It was 
last approved on April 26, 2021, via the standard PRA process which 
included the publication of 60- and 30-day Federal Register notices. 
The scope of the April 2021 umbrella accounts for Medicaid and CHIP 
State plan amendments, waivers, demonstrations, and reporting. This 
Federal Register notice seeks public comment on one or more of our 
collection of information requests that we believe are generic and fall 
within the scope of the umbrella. Interested persons are invited to 
submit comments regarding our burden estimates or any other aspect of 
this collection of information, including: the necessity and utility of 
the proposed information collection for the proper performance of the 
agency's functions, the accuracy of the estimated burden, ways to 
enhance the quality, utility and clarity of the information to be 
collected, and the use of automated collection techniques or other 
forms of information technology to minimize the information collection 
burden.

DATES: Comments must be received by December 10, 2025.

ADDRESSES: When commenting, please reference the applicable form number 
(CMS-10398 #43) and the OMB control number (0938-1148). To be assured

Generic Information Collections

    1. Title of Information Collection: Certified Community Behavioral 
Health Clinic (CCBHC) Cost Report; Type of Information Collection 
Request: Revision of an active collection of information request; Use: 
The CCBHC cost report allows clinics in the demonstration to calculate 
PPS rates using clinic-specific cost and visit data associated with 
delivery of the 9 statutory services as outlined under the authorizing 
PAMA at section 223(D) Scope of Services. CCBHCs used the cost report 
to calculate rates based on the existing CC PPS-1 daily, or CC PPS-2 
monthly rate that did not include separate crisis rate options. 
Calculation of the new daily and monthly special crisis services PPS 
rates required CMS to revise the existing CCBHC cost report to include 
the addition of worksheets to address the new crisis rate offerings 
that were finalized in the February 2024 CCBHC Technical Guidance. 
Special crisis services (SCS) rates were made effective January 1, 
2024, for any existing states that are interested in implementing 
either CC PPS-3 or CC PPS-4. New states entering the program beginning 
in July 2024 have the option to choose from among the four PPS rate 
options made available under the 2024 Technical Guidance and CCBHC cost 
report.
    CCBHCs in states that choose the CC PPS-2 rate methodology will 
require additional time to gather data for special populations and 
account for outlier thresholds. States and clinics selecting either the 
CC PPS-3 or CC PPS-4 crisis rate methodology will require additional 
time to separate costs and visit data for up to three special crisis 
services rates.
    Because use of the cost report involves participation in the CCBHC 
demonstration program, the information is expected to be collected 
annually, assuming rates are trended forward for the second year of the 
program using the Medicare Economic Index (MEI), rebased in the third 
year of the demonstration and trended forward for the fourth year of 
the demonstration using the MEI. However, if the state requires CCBHCs 
to rebase rates for other years of the demonstration using CCBHC cost 
report data, the provider would be required to complete the cost report 
each time the state rebases the rate. CMS does also require CCBHC 
demonstration states to submit cost reports in trended years although 
rates may only reflect changes based on MEI adjustment for inflationary 
changes. The state should indicate if the current cost report is used 
to rebase for the rate period or the rate that will be paid during the 
rate period if the rate changes solely by an MEI adjustment.
