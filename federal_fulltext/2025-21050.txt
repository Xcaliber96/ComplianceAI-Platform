South Sutter Water District; Notice of Revised Procedural 
Schedule for Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Project 
Relicense

    On December 28, 2023, the South Sutter Water District (SSWD) filed 
an application for a new license to continue to operate and maintain 
the 6.8-megawatt Camp Far West Hydroelectric Project No. 2997 (Camp Far 
West Project). On November 25, 2024, Commission staff issued a notice 
of intent to prepare an environmental assessment (EA) to evaluate the 
effects of relicensing the Camp Far West Project. The notice included 
an anticipated schedule for issuing the EA in November 2025.
    Staff are still evaluating the effects of relicensing the Camp Far 
West Project. In order for staff to fully consider all the information 
filed by SSWD, the procedural schedule for completing the EA is being 
revised as follows. Further revisions to the schedule may be made as 
appropriate.
