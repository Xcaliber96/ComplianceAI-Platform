Proposed Information Collection Request; Comment Request; NESHAP 
for Radionuclides (40 CFR Part 61, Subparts B, K, R and W) (Renewal)

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to 
submit an information collection request (ICR), ``NESHAP for 
Radionuclides (Renewal)'' (EPA ICR No. 1100.16, OMB Control No.

[[Page 52953]]

2060-0191) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and 
approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. Before doing 
so, the EPA is soliciting public comments on specific aspects of the 
proposed information collection as described below. An Agency may not 
conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number.

DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before January 23, 2026.

ADDRESSES: Submit your comments, referencing Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-
2003-0085, online using <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a> (our preferred method), by 
email to [<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#66074b0708024b144b2209050d03122603160748010910"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1c7d317d7278316e3158737f7779685c796c7d327b736a">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>], or by mail to: EPA Docket Center,

public docket without change, including any personal information 
provided, unless the comment includes profanity, threats, information 
claimed to be Confidential Business Information (CBI) or other 
information whose disclosure is restricted by statute.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supporting documents which explain in detail 
the information that the EPA will be collecting are available in the 
public docket for this ICR. The docket can be viewed online at 
<a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a> or in person at the EPA Docket Center, WJC West, 
Room 3334, 1301 Constitution Ave. NW, Washington, DC. The telephone 
number for the Docket Center is 202-566-1744. For additional

    Pursuant to section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 
EPA is soliciting comments and information to enable it to: (i) 
evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary 
for the proper performance of the functions of the Agency, including 
whether the information will have practical utility; (ii) evaluate the 
accuracy of the Agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed 
collection of information, including the validity of the methodology 
and assumptions used; (iii) enhance the quality, utility, and clarity 
of the information to be collected; and (iv) minimize the burden of the 
collection of information on those who are to respond, including 
through the use of appropriate automated electronic, mechanical, or 
other technological collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology, e.g., permitting electronic submission of responses. EPA 
will consider the comments received and amend the ICR as appropriate. 
The final ICR package will then be submitted to OMB for review and 
approval. At that time, EPA will issue another Federal Register notice 
to announce the submission of the ICR to OMB and the opportunity to 
submit additional comments to OMB.
    Abstract: On December 15, 1989, pursuant to Section 112 of the 
Clean Air Act as amended in 1977 (42 U.S.C. 1857), the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated National Emission Standards for 
Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) regulations to control radionuclide 
emissions from several source categories. The regulations are codified 
at 40 CFR part 61. Of the eight subparts (B, H, I, K, Q, R, T and W) 
included in the 1989 rule, as currently amended, four apply to 
privately-operated facilities. In addition to requiring operational 
practices that limit emissions, subparts B, K, R, and W impose 
radionuclide dose and/or emission limits, respectively, to underground 
uranium mines, elemental phosphorous plants, phosphogypsum stacks, and 
uranium mill tailings impoundments. Facilities must inspect 
impoundments, measure radionuclide emissions, perform analyses or 
calculations per EPA procedures, and report the results to the EPA.
    Information collected is used by the EPA to ensure that public 
health and the environment continue to be protected from the hazards of 
airborne radionuclides by compliance with these standards. Compliance 
is demonstrated through emissions testing and dose calculation when 
appropriate.
    Form Numbers: None.
    Respondents/affected entities: The North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS) codes of facilities associated with the 
activity of the respondents are: (1) Elemental Phosphorous 325180, (2) 
Phosphogypsum Stacks 212390, (3) Underground Uranium Mines 212290, and 
(4) Uranium Mill Tailings 212290.
    Respondent's obligation to respond: mandatory (CAA, Sec, 112; 40 
CFR part 61).
    Estimated number of respondents: 52 (total).
    Frequency of response: Monthly, annual, or one-time depending on 
the source category and respondent activity.
    Total estimated burden: 11,301 hours (per year). Burden is defined 
at 5 CFR 1320.03(b).
    Total estimated cost: $1,412,827 (per year), which includes 
$408,300 annualized capital or operation and maintenance costs.
    Changes in Estimates: Total estimated respondent hours increased 
from 4,146 hours in the previous approved version of this ICR to 
11,301, primarily as a result of additional subpart B and subpart W 
facilities potentially coming online by 2029. Two subpart B facilities 
were reporting at the time of the last renewal in 2023, however, the 
Agency identified 12 respondents that are likely to submit annual 
reports by 2029, and 12 responses were added to the ICR, adding 2,760 
hours of labor and $63,600 of non-labor cost to the burden that was 
approved in 2023. The Agency also identified a potential for an 
additional 15 non-conventional impoundments under subpart W to begin 
operation by 2029, adding an additional 4,215 hours of labor and $4,500 
of non-labor costs. For subparts K and R, there were no changes to the 
number of respondents, the annual time burden, or the annual non-labor 
cost compared to the most recent renewals of this ICR.\1\
