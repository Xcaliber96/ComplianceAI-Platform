Proposed Project: Programs To Reduce Underage Drinking--(OMB No. 0930-
0316)--Revision

    The Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act (STOP Act) was 
passed by Congress in 2006, reauthorized in December 2016 as part of 
the 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114-255) and the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2023 (Pub. L. 117-328), and codified into law in 42 
U.S.C. 290bb-25b: Programs to reduce underage drinking. The STOP Act 
contains four primary elements:
    1. The award of community-based coalition enhancement grants for 
underage drinking prevention activities to eligible entities currently 
receiving funds under the Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997.
    2. A national adult-oriented media public service campaign to 
prevent underage drinking, ``Talk. They Hear You.'', and an annual 
report to Congress evaluating the campaign.
    3. An annual report to Congress summarizing federal prevention 
activities and the extent of progress in

[[Page 52983]]

reducing underage drinking nationally, including data from national 
surveys conducted by federal agencies.
    4. An annual report to Congress ``on each State's performance in 
enacting, enforcing, and creating laws, regulations, and programs to 
prevent or reduce underage drinking.'' The survey that is the subject 
of this request gathers data used to develop the state-by-state report 
on prevention and enforcement activities related to underage drinking.
    Driven by the legislation and coordinated by the Interagency 
Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking (ICCPUD), 
each of these activities work together to prevent and reduce underage 
drinking. ICCPUD provides national leadership in federal policy and 
programming to support state and community activities that prevent and 
reduce underage drinking. The data collection activities described in 
this package serve to assess the outputs and outcomes of public health 
messaging and interventions. The data collection activities outlined in 
this package are:
    1. Survey of State Underage Drinking Prevention Policies, Programs, 
and Practices: An annual survey mandated by the STOP Act legislation 
sent to an individual designated by the governor of all 50 states and 
the mayor of the District of Columbia;
    2. Policy Academy Evaluations: An assessment of participant 
capacity and workforce development through ICCPUD's Alcohol Policy 
Academy and SAMHSA's State and Community Policy Academy;
    3. ``Parents' Night Out'' Evaluation: Tools for distribution of 
materials and evaluation of presenters and participants, including a 
solicitation of feedback from presenters and an assessment of changes 
in knowledge, skills, and confidence of parents and caregivers after 
receiving the training and materials for ``Parents' Night Out'' and 
``Talk. They Hear You.'' products;
    4. ``Talk. They Hear You.'' Mobile App Surveys: A parent and 
caregiver survey and an app satisfaction survey. The parent survey will 
allow parents to provide their insight on campaign materials, general 
demographic information, and details on their conversations with youth 
regarding underage drinking and substance use. The satisfaction survey 
will assess perceptions of the app function and content to inform 
future ``Talk. They Hear You.'' campaign refinement.
    5. ``Talk. They Hear You.'' Community Partner Surveys: A newsletter 
survey, a license survey, and a feedback survey. Each tool will be used 
to engage partners, disseminate materials, provide technical 
assistance, and receive feedback.
    6. Screen4Success: A pre-screener, screener, and consent/assent 
survey on the Screen4Success website. The tool is designed to screen 
for health, wellness, and well-being concerns and connect participants 
to resources in their area.

Survey of State Underage Drinking Prevention Policies, Programs, and 
Practices

    The STOP Act states that the ``Secretary [of Health and Human 
Services] shall . . . annually issue a report on each state's 
performance in enacting, enforcing, and creating laws, regulations, and 
programs to prevent or reduce underage drinking.'' The Secretary has 
delegated responsibility for this report to SAMHSA. Therefore, SAMHSA 
has developed a Survey of State Underage Drinking Prevention Policies, 
Programs, and Practices (the State Survey) to provide input for the 
state-by-state report on prevention and enforcement activities related 
to the underage drinking component of the annual Report to Congress on 
the Prevention and Reduction of Underage Drinking.
    Congress' purpose in mandating the collection of data on state 
policies, programs, and practices through the State Survey is to 
provide policymakers and the public with otherwise unavailable but much 
needed information regarding state underage drinking prevention 
policies and programs. SAMHSA and other federal agencies that have 
underage drinking prevention as part of their mandate use the results 
of the State Survey to inform federal programmatic priorities, as do 
other stakeholders, including community organizations. The information 
gathered by the State Survey has established a resource for state 
agencies and the public for assessing policies and programs in their 
own state and for becoming familiar with the policies, programs, 
practices, and funding priorities of other states.
    SAMHSA has determined that data on Categories #2 and #3 mandated in 
the STOP Act (as listed on page 2; enforcement and educational programs 
and programs targeting youth, parents, and caregivers) as well as 
states' collaborations with tribal governments, use of social marketing 
or counter-advertising campaigns, state-level interagency 
collaborations, and prevention workforce development activities are not 
available from secondary sources and therefore must be collected from 
the states themselves. The State Survey is therefore necessary to 
fulfill the Congressional mandate found in the STOP Act. Furthermore, 
the uniform collection of these data from the states over the last 15 
years has created a valuable longitudinal dataset, and the State 
Survey's renewal is vital to maintaining this resource.
    The State Survey is a single document that is divided into three 
sections: (1) enforcement of underage drinking laws; (2A) underage 
drinking prevention programs targeted to youth, families, parents, and 
caregivers, including data on the approximate number of persons served 
by these programs; (2B) state collaborations and best practices; (2C) 
interagency collaborations and state participation in social marketing 
media campaigns intended to reduce underage drinking; and (3) workforce 
development activities, including strategies and funds expended on 
recruiting and retaining a behavioral health workforce.
    SAMHSA collects the required data using an online survey data 
collection platform. Links to the survey are distributed to states via 
email. The State Survey is sent to each state governor's office and the 
Office of the Mayor of the District of Columbia. SAMHSA provides both 
telephone and electronic technical support to state agency staff and 
emphasizes that the states are expected to provide data from existing 
state databases and other data sources available to them. The burden 
estimate below considers these assumptions.
    The estimated annual response burden to collect this information is 
as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alcohol Policy Academy Evaluation

    ICCPUD's Alcohol Policy Academy strives to reduce and prevent 
underage and excessive drinking by increasing the capacity of community 
coalitions to modify the community context through the policy process. 
The Alcohol Policy Academy includes 14 coalitions from across the U.S., 
with two individuals from each coalition serving as Academy 
participants. The Alcohol Policy Academy evaluation is designed to 
measure the effectiveness of increasing coalition capacity through the 
training and coaching of the policy process. Additionally, the 
evaluation will measure the increase in the policy training workforce 
through a mentee-to-coach development pipeline. The scope of the 
evaluation is limited to measuring the impact of the Alcohol Policy 
Academy curriculum on participants and coaches.
    The evaluation comprises seven surveys and one focus group. Surveys 
are conducted after each monthly training and coaching call. The 
participant surveys seek feedback on changes in knowledge, skills, and 
confidence after each training and coaching call as well as feedback on 
the training content and training/coaching provider. The coach surveys 
track the progress of the coalitions. These surveys take the 
participants and coaches approximately 5-10 minutes each to complete. 
The participants also complete a baseline survey, a 12-month follow-up 
survey, and an 18-month follow-up survey. These surveys assess whether 
participants reach their own goals during the Alcohol Policy Academy, 
how they share their knowledge and skills gained, and how they continue 
to progress in the policy process. All surveys will be fielded using a 
web-based survey tool. The focus group within the cohort will collect 
qualitative data from the participants on their experience.
    The table below indicates the estimated total annual burden on the 
participants and coaches of the Alcohol Policy Academy. The survey 
estimates include reading the instructions and questions and responding 
to each question. The focus group is scheduled for one hour and 
includes introductions, instructions, posing of questions, and open 
discussion.
    The estimated annual response burden to collect this information is 
as follows:

``Talk. They Hear You''

    The ``Talk They Hear You'' campaign comprises a variety of tools 
and resources designed to decrease underage drinking by encouraging 
families, parents and caregivers, educators, and community members/
organizations to proactively engage youth in conversations about 
alcohol and other substances. Research has demonstrated that active and 
engaged adults can reduce underage drinking.\1\

``Parents' Night Out'' Evaluation

    The ``Parents' Night Out'' Evaluation will assess changes in 
knowledge, skills, and confidence of parents and caregivers after 
receiving the training and materials from ``Parents' Night Out'' and 
``Talk. They Hear You.'' products. This evaluation will be delivered in 
collaboration with community partners, who will be exposed to varying 
combinations of ``Parents' Night Out'' and materials to determine 
change before and after exposure. The information gleaned in surveys of 
participants and presenters of the sessions will allow the evaluation 
team to assess whether ``Parents' Night Out'' is being implemented as 
intended and which products are most useful in increasing parents' and 
caregivers' capacity and intentions. The results will be shared with 
the implementation team for ``Parents' Night Out'' curriculum 
modifications and for updating ``Talk. They Hear You.'' materials. 
Similarly, information collected regarding technical assistance from 
the Presenter Survey will be used to continuously improve the materials 
to best serve the needs of the users.

Mobile App Parent Survey

    The ``Talk. They Hear You.'' mobile app provides families, parents, 
and caregivers access to resources, conversation practice sessions, and 
Screen4Success. The mobile app's Parent Survey will be linked within 
the ``Talk. They Hear You.'' mobile app for parents and caregivers of 
youth ages 12-20 to complete. Parents and caregivers will be able to 
provide their insight on campaign materials, general demographic 
information, and details on their conversations with youth regarding 
underage drinking and substance use. This feedback will help the 
campaign team better serve parents and caregivers by tailoring 
resources to meet the age range of youth and parental areas of 
interest.

Mobile App Satisfaction Survey

    The campaign team is interested in continuing deployment of the 
User Satisfaction Survey. The overall objective of the survey is to 
determine users' satisfaction with the app and if the user would like 
to see any changes made to the app. The survey will inform SAMHSA on 
how the mobile app resonates with the intended users and determine 
whether the mobile app is effective at conveying the importance of 
talking with kids early and often about underage drinking and other 
substances use through guided conversations. This survey will be 
available at the bottom of each page of the mobile app and promoted 
through in-app pop-up notifications.
    The table below indicates the estimated total annual burden on the 
respondents of the survey. The survey estimates include reading and 
responding to each question, and totals 3 minutes. The wage rate was 
determined based on the highest state minimum wage, as respondent 
locations are not collected.

consent/assent from parents and participants; navigate to local and 
national resources; and track referrals to services. Information 
collected at the consent of the participant will be shared with 
researchers to better inform prevention efforts and support services of 
the ``Talk. They Hear You.'' campaign. Additionally, organizations who 
use Screen4Success can utilize their aggregated, de-identified 
participant result data to inform local interventions, shape policy, 
and supplement applications to secure funding.
    The estimated annual response burden to collect this information is 
as follows:
