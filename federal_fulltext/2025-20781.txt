DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

[Docket No. CP26-14-000]


Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC; Notice of Scoping Period 
Requesting Comments on Environmental Issues for the Proposed MVP Boost 
Project

    The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or 
Commission) will prepare an environmental document that will discuss 
the environmental impacts of the MVP Boost Project (Project) involving 
construction and operation of facilities by Mountain Valley Pipeline, 
LLC (Mountain Valley) in Wetzel, Braxton, and Fayette Counties, West 
Virginia and Montgomery County, Virginia. The Commission will use this 
environmental document in its decision-making process to determine 
whether the project is in the public convenience and necessity.
    This notice announces the opening of the scoping process the 
Commission will use to gather input from the public and interested 
agencies regarding the project. As part of the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA) review process, the Commission takes into account 
concerns the public may have about proposals and the environmental 
impacts that could result from its action whenever it considers the 
issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. This 
gathering of public input is referred to as ``scoping.'' The main goal 
of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the environmental 
document on the important environmental issues. Additional information 
about the Commission's NEPA process is described below in the NEPA 
Process and Environmental Document section of this notice.
    By this notice, the Commission requests public comments on the 
scope of issues to address in the environmental document. To ensure 
that your comments are timely and properly recorded, please submit your 
comments so that the Commission receives them in Washington, DC on or 
before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 19, 2025. Comments may be 
submitted in written form. Further details on how to submit comments 
are provided in the Public Participation section of this notice.
    Your comments should focus on the potential environmental effects, 
reasonable alternatives, and measures to avoid or lessen environmental 
impacts. Your input will help the Commission staff determine what 
issues they need to evaluate in the environmental document. Commission 
staff will consider all written comments during the preparation of the 
environmental document.
    If you submitted comments on this project to the Commission before 
the opening of this docket on October 23, 2025, you will need to file 
those comments in Docket No. CP26-14-000 to ensure they are considered 
as part of this proceeding.
    This notice is being sent to the Commission's current environmental 
mailing list for this project. State and local government 
representatives should notify their constituents of this proposed 
project and encourage them to comment on their areas of concern.
    If you are a landowner receiving this notice, a pipeline company 
representative may contact you about the acquisition of an easement to 
construct, operate, and maintain the

[[Page 52933]]

proposed facilities. The company would seek to negotiate a mutually 
acceptable easement agreement. You are not required to enter into an 
agreement. However, if the Commission approves the project, the Natural 
Gas Act conveys the right of eminent domain to the company. Therefore, 
if you and the company do not reach an easement agreement, the pipeline 
company could initiate condemnation proceedings in court. In such 
instances, compensation would be determined by a judge in accordance 
with state law. The Commission does not subsequently grant, exercise, 
or oversee the exercise of that eminent domain authority. The courts 
have exclusive authority to handle eminent domain cases; the Commission 
has no jurisdiction over these matters.
    Mountain Valley provided landowners with a fact sheet prepared by 
the FERC entitled ``An Interstate Natural Gas Facility On My Land? What 
Do I Need To Know?'' which addresses typically asked questions, 
including the use of eminent domain and how to participate in the 
Commission's proceedings. This fact sheet along with other landowner 
topics of interest are available for viewing on the FERC website 
(<a href="http://www.ferc.gov">www.ferc.gov</a>) under the Natural Gas, Landowner Topics link.

Summary of the Proposed Project

    Mountain Valley proposes to make modifications to the existing 
Bradshaw, Harris, and Stallworth Compressor Stations (CS) and construct 
and operate the Swann CS. The MVP Boost Project would provide about 
600,000 dekatherms of natural gas per day from interconnection points 
with Equitrans, L.P. and EQM Gathering Opco, LLC to delivery points on 
the Mountain Valley Pipeline Mainline system and Mountain Valley 
Pipeline Southgate system. According to Mountain Valley, its project 
would expand existing Mountain Valley Pipeline infrastructure to 
increase system capacity and delivery capabilities, and transport 
additional volumes of natural gas from interconnection points.
    The MVP Boost Project would consist of the following facilities:
    <bullet> installation of one additional natural gas turbine and 
auxiliary facilities to add an additional 23,470 horsepower (hp) to the 
Bradshaw CS;
    <bullet> relocation of existing blowdown silencers and installation 
of one additional natural gas turbine and auxiliary facilities to add 
an additional 52,500 hp to the Harris CS;
    <bullet> relocation of existing blowdown silencers and installation 
of two additional natural gas turbines and auxiliary facilities and 
upgrades to two existing natural gas turbines to add an additional 
52,880 hp to the Stallworth CS;
    <bullet> installation of a new compressor station with three 
natural gas turbines, for a total of 136,900 hp at the Swann CS; and
    <bullet> installation of a new pig launcher and receiver,\1\ 
mainline valve, and auxiliary facilities at the Swann CS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ A ``pig'' is a tool that the pipeline company inserts into 
and pushes through the pipeline for cleaning the pipeline, 
conducting internal inspections, or other purposes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The general location of the project facilities is shown in appendix 
1.\2\

free, (886) 208-3676 or TTY (202) 502-8659.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Land Requirements for Construction

    Construction of the proposed facilities would disturb about 43.3 
acres of land within Mountain Valley's existing right-of-way. Following 
construction, Mountain Valley would maintain about 21.3 acres for 
permanent operation of the project's facilities; the remaining acreage 
would be restored.

NEPA Process and the Environmental Document

    Any environmental document issued by the Commission will discuss 
impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation 
of the proposed project under the relevant general resource areas:
    <bullet> geology and soils;
    <bullet> water resources and wetlands;
    <bullet> vegetation and wildlife;
    <bullet> threatened and endangered species;
    <bullet> cultural resources;
    <bullet> socioeconomics;
    <bullet> land use;
    <bullet> air quality and noise; and
    <bullet> reliability and safety.
    Commission staff will also evaluate reasonable alternatives to the 
proposed project or portions of the project and make recommendations on 
how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. Your 
comments will help Commission staff identify and focus on the issues 
that might have an effect on the human environment and potentially 
eliminate others from further study and discussion in the environmental 
document.
    Following this scoping period, Commission staff will determine 
whether to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) or an Environmental 
Impact Statement (EIS). The EA or the EIS will present Commission 
staff's

[[Page 52934]]

independent analysis of the issues. If Commission staff prepares an EA, 
a Notice of Schedule for the Preparation of an Environmental Assessment 
will be issued. The EA may be issued for an allotted public comment 
period. The Commission would consider timely comments on the EA before 
making its decision regarding the proposed project. If Commission staff 
prepares an EIS, a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS/Notice of 
Schedule will be issued, which will open up an additional comment 
period. Staff will then prepare a draft EIS which will be issued for 
public comment. Commission staff will consider all timely comments 
received during the comment period on the draft EIS and revise the 
document, as necessary, before issuing a final EIS. Any EA or draft and 
final EIS will be available in electronic format in the public record 
through eLibrary \3\ and the Commission's natural gas environmental 
documents web page (<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/industries-data/natural-gas/environment/environmental-documents">https://www.ferc.gov/industries-data/natural-gas/environment/environmental-documents</a>). If eSubscribed, you will receive 
instant email notification when the environmental document is issued.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ For instructions on connecting to eLibrary, refer to the 
last page of this notice.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With this notice, the Commission is asking agencies with 
jurisdiction by law and/or special expertise with respect to the 
environmental issues of this project to formally cooperate in the 
preparation of the environmental document.\4\ Agencies that would like 
to request cooperating agency status should follow the instructions for 
filing comments provided under the Public Participation section of this 
notice.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consultation Under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation 
Act

    In accordance with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's 
implementing regulations for section 106 of the National Historic 
Preservation Act, the Commission is using this notice to initiate 
consultation with the applicable State Historic Preservation Office(s), 
and to solicit their views and those of other government agencies, 
interested Indian tribes, and the public on the project's potential 
effects on historic properties.\5\ The environmental document for this 
project will document findings on the impacts on historic properties 
and summarize the status of consultations under section 106.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's regulations 
are at Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 800. Those 
regulations define historic properties as any prehistoric or 
historic district, site, building, structure, or object included in 
or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic 
Places.
