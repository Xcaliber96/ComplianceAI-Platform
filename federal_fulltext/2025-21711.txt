DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

[Docket No. CP25-209-000]


Great Basin Gas Transmission Company; Notice of Availability of 
the Environmental Assessment for the Proposed 2026 Great Basin 
Expansion Project

    The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or 
Commission) has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for the 2026 
Great Basin Expansion Project (Project), proposed by Great Basin Gas 
Transmission Company (Great Basin) in the above-referenced docket.\1\ 
Great Basin requests authorization to construct, operate, and abandon 
certain natural gas pipeline facilities. The expansion would provide 
8,129 dekatherms per day of incremental firm transportation service for 
two existing firm transportation shippers and would require 
construction of approximately 4.7 miles of upsized or looped pipeline 
in two segments across Lyon and Washoe Counties, Nevada.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For tracking purposes under the National Environmental 
Policy Act, the unique identification number for documents relating 
to this environmental review is EAXX-019-20-000-1752151875.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Any person wishing to comment on the EA may do so. To ensure 
consideration of your comments on the proposal prior to making a 
decision on the project, it is important that the Commission receive 
your comments on or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 26, 2025. 
Instructions for filing comments are provided on page 3.
    FERC is the lead federal agency for authorizing interstate natural 
gas transmission facilities under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and 
the lead federal agency for preparation of the EA. The EA assesses the 
potential environmental effects of the Project in accordance with the 
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) \2\ and 
the Commission's implementing regulations.\3\ The principal purposes of 
the EA are to: identify and assess the potential effects on the natural 
and human environment; describe and evaluate reasonable alternatives; 
identify and recommend mitigation measures; and facilitate public 
involvement in the

[[Page 55099]]

environmental review process. The EA concludes that approval of the 
proposed project would not constitute a major federal action 
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended 
(Public Law [Pub. L.] 91-190. 42 U.S.C. 4321-4347, as amended by 
Pub. L. 94-52, July 3, 1975; Pub. L. 94-83, August 9, 1975; Pub. L. 
97-258, 4(b), September 13, 1982; Pub. L. 118-5, June 3, 2023; Pub. 
L. 119-21, July 4, 2025).
    \3\ 18 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 380.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) participated as a cooperating 
agency in the preparation of the EA. Cooperating agencies have 
jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to resources 
potentially affected by the proposal and participate in the NEPA 
analysis. Project workspace would cross approximately 0.3 mile of 
public land and 1,538 feet of an existing permanent access road managed 
by the BLM. The BLM will adopt and use the EA to consider the issuance 
of a right-of-way grant for the portion of the project on federal 
lands.
    The proposed Project includes the following facilities:
    <bullet> installing approximately 2.3 miles of new 20-inch-diameter 
steel pipeline loop \4\ parallel to Great Basin's existing Carson 
Lateral (Wadsworth segment) in Washoe County, Nevada;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ A pipeline loop is a segment of pipe constructed parallel to 
an existing pipeline to increase capacity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> abandoning by removal and same-ditch replacement of 
approximately 2.4 miles of existing 10-inch-diameter steel pipeline 
with new 20-inch-diameter steel pipeline (Highway segment) in Lyon 
County, Nevada; and
    <bullet> installing and abandoning associated auxiliary or 
appurtenant facilities.
    The Commission mailed a copy of the Notice of Availability of the 
Environmental Assessment for the Proposed 2026 Great Basin Expansion 
Project of the EA to federal, state, and local government 
representatives and agencies; elected officials; environmental and 
public interest groups; Native American tribes; potentially affected 
landowners and other interested individuals and groups; and newspapers 
and libraries in the Project area. The EA is only available in 
electronic format. It may be viewed and downloaded from the FERC's 
website (<a href="http://www.ferc.gov">www.ferc.gov</a>), on the natural gas environmental documents page 
(<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/industries-data/natural-gas/environment/environmental-documents">https://www.ferc.gov/industries-data/natural-gas/environment/environmental-documents</a>). In addition, the EA may be accessed by using 
the eLibrary link on the FERC's website. Click on the eLibrary link 
(<a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/search">https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/search</a>), select ``General Search'' 
and enter the docket number in the ``Docket Number'' field, excluding 
the last three digits (i.e., CP25-209). Be sure you have selected an 
appropriate date range. For assistance, please contact FERC Online

    The EA is not a decision document. It presents Commission staff's 
independent analysis of the environmental issues for the Commission to 
consider when addressing the merits of all issues in this proceeding. 
Under section 7(c) of the NGA, the Commission determines whether 
interstate natural gas transportation facilities are in the public 
convenience and necessity and, if so, grants a Certificate of Public 
Convenience and Necessity to construct and operate them. Section 7(b) 
of the NGA specifies that no natural gas company shall abandon any 
portion of its facilities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction 
without the Commission first finding that the abandonment will not 
negatively affect the present or future public convenience and 
necessity. The Commission bases its decisions on both economic issues, 
including need, and environmental effects.
    Your comments should focus on the EA's disclosure and discussion of 
potential environmental effects, reasonable alternatives, and measures 
to avoid or lessen environmental effects. The more specific your 
comments, the more useful they will be. For your convenience, there are 
three methods you can use to file your comments to the Commission. The 
Commission encourages electronic filing of comments and has staff 
available to assist you at (866) 208-3676 or 
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bafcdfc8d9f5d4d6d3d4dfe9cfcacad5c8cefadcdfc8d994ddd5cc"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="32745740517d5c5e5b5c57614742425d404672545740511c555d44">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Please carefully follow these instructions 
so that your comments are properly recorded.
    (1) You can file your comments electronically using the eComment 
feature on the Commission's website (<a href="http://www.ferc.gov">www.ferc.gov</a>) under the link to

    Filing environmental comments will not give you intervenor status, 
but you do not need intervenor status to have your comments considered. 
Only intervenors have the right to seek rehearing or judicial review of 
the Commission's decision. At this point in this proceeding, the 
timeframe for filing timely intervention requests has expired. Any 
person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion 
to intervene out-of-time pursuant to Rule 214(b)(3) and (d) of the 
Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures (18 CFR 385.214(b)(3) and 
(d)) and show good cause why the time limitation should be waived. 
Motions to intervene are more fully described at <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/how-intervene">https://www.ferc.gov/how-intervene</a>.

such as orders, notices, and rulemakings.
    In addition, the Commission offers a free service called 
eSubscription which allows you to keep track of all formal issuances 
and submittals in specific dockets. This can reduce the amount of time
