this action, the Agency is withdrawing the direct final rule 
``Environmental Protection Agency Acquisition Regulation (EPAAR); 
Special Contracting Methods; Options; Contracts,'' published on 
September 22, 2025. We stated in that direct final rule that if we 
received adverse comment by October 31, 2025, the direct final rule 
would not take effect and we would publish a timely withdrawal in the 
Federal Register. Because the EPA subsequently received adverse comment 
on that direct final rule, we are withdrawing the direct final rule.
