Revisions to This Information Collection

    ATF is revising this information collection, OMB control number 
1140-0010, to make the form electronically fillable and allow it to be 
submitted by email. In addition, ATF will have made the form part of 
its online eForms platform by the time this ICR completes the renewal 
process, both of which result in full electronic submission. In the 
process of these changes, ATF has also made the second copy 
automatically auto-fill, when it was previously completed by the 
respondent in addition to the primary form. ATF also made some 
additional small edits to the form to make it easier to read and made a 
slight revision to the title to clarify the type of transportation 
covered.
    The changes to the form due to updated technology have decreased 
the time necessary to complete the form, which was previously 20 
minutes (ten minutes were attributed to addressing and mailing) and has 
now decreased to ten minutes. In addition, respondents no longer incur 
mailing time and costs. There has also been a decrease in the number of 
respondents per year, from 20,000 respondents during the last renewal 
to 12,878 during this renewal, a decrease of 7,122 respondents. These 
combined changes have resulted in a decrease in total annual burden 
hours from 6,667 hours to 2,151, a decrease of 4,516 hours, and a 
corresponding decrease in the monetized time value for this ICR.
