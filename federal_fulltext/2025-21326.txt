SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  The FCC may not conduct or sponsor a

with a collection of information subject to the PRA that does not 
display a valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number.
    OMB Control Number: 3060-1081.
    Title: Sections 1.2002, 54.201, 54.202, 54.205, Telecommunications 
Carriers Eligible for Universal Service Support.
    Form Number: N/A.
    Type of Review: Revision of a currently approved collection.
    Respondents: Business or other for-profit.
    Number of Respondents and Responses: 24 respondents; 28 responses.
    Estimated Time per Response: 1-40 hours.
    Obligation to Respond: Required to obtain or retain benefits. 
Statutory authority is contained in sections 201(b), 214(e)(6), and 
303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 201(b), 
214(e)(6), 303(r).
    Frequency of Response: One-time reporting requirement.
    Total Annual Burden: 808 hours.
    Total Annual Cost: No cost.
    Needs and Uses: Section 254(e) of the Communications Act of 1934, 
as amended (Act) provides that ``only an ETC designated under section 
214(e) shall be eligible to receive specific Federal universal service 
support.''
    Section 214(e)(2) of the Act gives state commissions the primary 
responsibility for performing ETC designations.
    Section 214(e)(6) vests the Commission with authority to designate 
as an ETC ``a common carrier providing telephone exchange service and 
exchange access that is not subject to the jurisdiction of a State 
commission.''
    Section 214(e)(4) provides that state commissions, in a case of a 
common carrier designated under paragraph (2) of this section, or the 
Commission, in a case of a common carrier designated under paragraph 
(6) of this section, ``shall permit'' an ETC to relinquish its 
designation ``in any area served by more than one'' ETC so long as 
``the remaining [ETCs] ensure that all customers served by the 
relinquishing carrier will continue to be served,'' and the 
relinquishing carrier provides ``sufficient notice to permit the 
purchase or construction of adequate facilities by any remaining 
eligible telecommunications carrier.'' The ETC must provide advance 
notice to the state commission or the Commission.
    The Commission's rules for ETC designation require the collection 
of information specified below, except where the Commission has waived 
information collection requirements when enforcing them would not serve 
the public interest.
    On October 20, 2023, the Commission adopted the Connect America 
Fund et al., WC Docket No. 10-90 et al. WT Docket No. 10-208, Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking and Report and Order, FCC 23-87 (Oct. 20, 2023) 
(Administrative Order). In the Administrative Order, the Commission 
modified, in relevant part, section 205 of the Commission's rules, to 
require an ETC that intends to relinquish its ETC designation to 
provide: (1) advance notice to the state commission and to the 
Commission of such intention to relinquish, and (2) notice to the 
Commission of the state authority's decision to permit or deny such 
relinquishment, within 10 days of its decision. These filings must be 
submitted regardless of whether the ETC is currently receiving federal 
support. The Commission identified its statutory authority to impose 
these requirements through section 254 of the Act and as reasonably 
ancillary thereto.
    The Commission notes that information collections associated with 
the Lifeline-only ETC designations and relinquishments are reflected in 
OMB Control No. 3060-0819.
    This information collection addresses the burdens associated with 
these requirements.

Federal Communications Commission.

Secretary, Office of the Secretary.
