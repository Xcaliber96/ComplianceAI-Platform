SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Description: The SCIP provides federal funding to state courts to 
assess their child welfare and judicial practices and develop and 
implement improvement plans. States use funds in a variety of ways, 
including improving legal representation and hearing quality, enhancing 
the engagement of families in court proceedings, and supporting child 
welfare and court partnerships. The proposed collection is a 
continuation of the current collection and comprised of two 
instruments: A strategic plan and self-assessment. The self-assessment 
reflects what the state has done in the prior year focusing on its 
progress and status within the change management cycle. The strategic 
plan looks forward to those interventions and actions the state plans 
to undertake to address needs or buttress strengths they have 
discovered in their assessment activities. These two instruments serve 
as an application for annual SCIP funding as well as a source for data 
which are shared back with SCIP grantees to support their community 
learning and peer connections, to inform technical assistance, and 
support any reporting to Congress and others. Regarding updates to the 
self-assessment and strategic plan, a minor change was made early in 
2025 to the self-assessment in response to Executive Orders, amounting 
to one optional topical box and a few drop-down categories being 
removed. Additionally, the following minor changes are proposed to the 
currently approved version of the self-assessment. These do not impact 
estimated time to respond.
    <bullet> Brief questions were added on IV-E funding, self-
assessment point of contact or publishing information, and additional 
collaborative partners.
    <bullet> Dropdown categories have been added to reduce burden and 
improve data where `other' was too often selected.
    <bullet> Some questions about technical assistance states 
participated in were removed because alternative data sources were 
found that reduced burden.
    No changes are proposed to the strategic plan.
    The next application will be due June 30, 2026.
    Respondents: We anticipate the highest state court of every state, 
the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to 
respond. All 53 jurisdictions currently participate in the program. One 
response from each jurisdiction is anticipated.
