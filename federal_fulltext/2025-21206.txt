    DOJ seeks PRA authorization for this information collection for 
three (3) years. OMB authorization for an ICR cannot be for more than 
three (3) years without renewal. The DOJ notes that information 
collection requirements submitted to the OMB for existing ICRs receive 
a month-to-month extension while they undergo review.

Overview of This Information Collection

    1. Type of Information Collection: New Collection.
    2. Title of the Form/Collection: Optional Flexible Financial 
Assistance Survey.
    3. Agency form number, if any, and the applicable component of the 
Department of Justice sponsoring the collection: Form Number: 1122-
XXXX. U.S. Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women.
    4. Affected public who will be asked or required to respond, as 
well as a brief abstract: The affected public includes grantees under 
OVW's Financial Assistance Program and recipients of flexible financial 
assistance distributed by those grantees. The survey will ask limited 
questions about how and when survivors of domestic violence, sexual 
assault, dating violence and stalking received flexible financial 
assistance, as well as information about the impact of financial 
assistance in pursuing safety and security for themselves and their 
families. This data will inform future programming and provide 
information about the effectiveness of OVW-funded financial assistance 
for victims to Congress and other stakeholders. The survey is optional.
    5. An estimate of the total number of respondents and the amount of 
time estimated for an average respondent to respond/reply: It is 
estimated that it will take approximately 2,600 respondents 
approximately 10 minutes to complete the optional survey.
    6. An estimate of the total public burden (in hours) associated 
with the collection: The total annual hour burden to complete the data 
collection forms is 433 hours. OVW anticipates that 13 grantees will 
administer this survey to an annual average of 200 people who receive 
flexible financial assistance. Two hundred participants each at 13 
sites totals 2,600 people completing the survey each year. If it takes 
10 minutes to complete the survey, then that is 26,000 minutes 
annually, which is approximately 433 hours.
    7. An estimate of the total annual cost burden associated with the 
collection, if applicable: The annualized cost to the Federal 
Government resulting from the OVW staff review of the survey is 
estimated to be $24,556.
    8. Total Burden Hours:
