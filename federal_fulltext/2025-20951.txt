Amendment 39-23197; AD 2025-24-02]
RIN 2120-AA64


Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Final rule; request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for 
certain The Boeing Company Model 737-700, -800, -900, and -900ER series 
airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a runway excursion 
caused by loss of braking. An inspection found that the right main 
landing gear (MLG) hydraulic hoses for the brakes were incorrectly 
installed at the flow limiters, and the left MLG wheel speed transducer 
wires were also interchanged. This AD requires a general visual 
inspection (GVI) of the left and right MLG brake hydraulic hoses for 
any crossed installation, antiskid valve and transducer operational 
tests, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD 
to address the unsafe condition on these products.

DATES: This AD is effective December 10, 2025.
    The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by 
reference of a certain publication listed in this AD as of December 10, 
2025.

not specifically designated as CBI will be placed in the public docket 
for this rulemaking.

Background

    The FAA has received a report of a runway excursion caused by loss 
of braking. An inspection found that the right MLG hydraulic hoses for 
the brakes were incorrectly installed (crossed) at the flow limiters, 
and the left MLG wheel speed transducer wires were interchanged. This 
condition could result in incorrect antiskid system operation, which 
could result in loss of braking and potential for a runway excursion 
with serious or fatal injuries. The FAA is issuing this AD to address 
the unsafe condition on these products.

FAA's Determination

    The FAA is issuing this AD because the agency has determined the 
unsafe condition described previously is likely to exist or develop in 
other products of the same type design.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed Boeing Alert Requirements Bulletin 737-32A1599 RB, 
dated October 14, 2025. This material specifies procedures for a GVI of 
the left and right MLG brake hydraulic hoses for any incorrect 
(crossed) installation, antiskid valve and transducer operational 
tests, and applicable on-condition actions.
    On-condition actions include installing the brake hydraulic hoses 
to the correct flow limiter or union, and doing applicable corrective 
actions until the operational tests are passed. This material is 
reasonably available because the interested parties have access to it 
through their normal course of business or by the means identified in 
the ADDRESSES section.

AD Requirements

    This AD requires accomplishing the actions identified in Boeing 
Alert Requirements Bulletin 737-32A1599 RB, dated October 14, 2025, 
already described, except as discussed under ``Differences Between this 
AD and the Referenced Material.''

Differences Between This AD and the Referenced Material

    Although Boeing Alert Requirements Bulletin 737-32A1599 RB, dated 
October 14, 2025, does not specify reporting inspection and test 
results, reporting is included in Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737-
32A1599, dated October 14, 2025. The FAA has determined that reporting 
is necessary. The number of findings in such reports, and the number of 
flight cycles since accomplishing any service bulletin identified in 
Appendix A of Boeing Alert Requirements Bulletin 737-32A1599 RB, dated 
October 14, 2025, will help inform the FAA as to whether additional 
rulemaking may be necessary.

Justification for Immediate Adoption and Determination of the Effective 
Date

    Section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 
551 et seq.) authorizes agencies to forego notice and comment 
procedures for rules when the agency, for ``good cause,'' finds that 
those procedures are ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
public interest.'' Under this section, an agency, upon finding good 
cause, may issue a final rule without providing notice and seeking 
comment prior to issuance. Further, section 553(d) of the APA 
authorizes agencies to make rules effective in less than thirty days, 
upon a finding of good cause.
    An unsafe condition exists that requires the immediate adoption of 
this AD without providing an opportunity for public comments prior to 
adoption. The FAA has found that the risk to the flying public 
justifies forgoing notice and comment prior to adoption of this rule, 
because incorrectly installed (crossed) brake hydraulic hoses for the 
MLG and interchanged left MLG wheel speed transducer wires could cause 
incorrect antiskid system operation and result in loss of braking and a 
runway excursion with serious or fatal injuries. Further, the effects 
of crossed brake hoses may not be noticed until there is a skidding 
condition. Additionally, the compliance time in this AD is shorter than 
the time necessary for the public to comment and for publication of the 
final rule. Accordingly, notice and opportunity for prior public 
comment are impracticable.
    In addition, the FAA finds that good cause exists pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 553(d) for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days, 
for the same reasons the FAA found good cause to forgo notice and 
comment.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) do not 
apply when an agency finds good cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 to adopt 
a rule without prior notice and comment. Because the FAA has determined 
that it has good cause to adopt this rule without notice and comment, 
RFA analysis is not required.

Costs of Compliance

    While 6,816 airplanes are included in the Effectivity of Boeing 
Alert Requirements Bulletin 737-32A1599, dated October 14, 2025, and 
thus the applicability of this AD, the FAA expects that only 
approximately 100 airplanes of U.S. registry are currently in a 
configuration that necessitates immediate action and therefore will 
incur the following estimated costs.

                                                 Estimated Costs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                    Cost per       Cost on U.S.
               Action                        Labor cost           Parts cost        product         operators

Inspection and tests................  7 work-hours x $85 per               $0             $595          $59,500
                                       hour = $595.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[Page 53217]]

    The FAA estimates the following costs to do any necessary 
installations and reporting that would be required based on the results 
of the inspection. The FAA has no way of determining the number of 
aircraft that might need reporting:

                                                On-Condition Cost
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                 $170.
Reporting.....................................  1 work-hour x $85 per hour = $85               0              85
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FAA has received no definitive data on which to base the cost 
estimates for on-condition corrective actions to address failed 
operational tests specified in this AD.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    A federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to, nor shall a person be subject to a penalty for 
failure to comply with a collection of information subject to the 
requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act unless that collection of 
information displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. The OMB 
Control Number for this information collection is 2120-0056. Public 
reporting for this collection of information is estimated to take 
approximately 1 hour per response, including the time for reviewing 
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and 
maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the 
collection of information. All responses to this collection of 
information are mandatory. Send comments regarding this burden estimate 
or any other aspect of this collection of information, including 
suggestions for reducing this burden, to: Information Collection 
Clearance Officer, Federal Aviation Administration, 10101 Hillwood 
Parkway, Fort Worth, TX 76177-1524.

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, 
on the relationship between the national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various 
levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866, and
    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska.
