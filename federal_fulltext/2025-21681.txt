SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FHWA published a Federal Register Notice 
with a 60-day public comment period on this information collection on 
December 3, 2024, at 89 FR 95895. The notice received one comment. This 
comment called for a clear grant application process in order ``to 
improve trust between local and federal governments.'' FHWA has 
considered this comment and will assess options to streamline the 
application process during the next round of funding. The burden 
summary provided below covers the entire 3-year PRA period and has been 
updated since the publication of the 60-Day Federal Register Notice to 
reflect a more accurate estimate of total number of applications and 
evaluation activities.
    Title: Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, 
Efficient, and Cost-Saving Transportation (PROTECT) Competitive Grant 
Program and Voluntary Resilience Improvement Plans.
    Background: The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) 
established the Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, 
Efficient, and Cost-Saving Transportation (PROTECT) Competitive Grant 
Program to plan for and strengthen surface transportation to be more 
resilient to current and future weather events, natural disasters, and 
changing conditions, such as severe storms, flooding, drought, levee 
and dam failures, wildfire, rockslides, mudslides, sea level rise, 
extreme weather, including extreme temperature, and earthquakes. The 
program includes four grant categories: Planning, Resilience 
Improvement, Community Resilience and Evacuation Routes, and At-Risk 
Coastal Infrastructure.

Summary of Information Collection Activities

    For this competitive grant program, the FHWA issues Notices of 
Funding Opportunity (NOFO) that describe the requirements of the 
PROTECT Competitive Grant Program, including the criteria that will be 
used to evaluate applications. The NOFOs provide a description of the 
application requirements. Eligible applicants request PROTECT funds in 
the form of an electronic grant application. Additional information 
submissions are required for applicants who are selected for a grant 
(i.e., the grantees) during the grant agreement, grant implementation 
and evaluation phases.
    Additionally, State DOTs and MPOs may develop Resilience 
Improvement Plans under the PROTECT Program. A Resilience Improvement 
Plan is a voluntary, risk-based assessment of vulnerable transportation 
assets in immediate and long-term transportation planning that 
demonstrates a systemic approach to surface transportation system 
resilience (23 U.S.C. 176(e)). A Resilience Improvement Plan can reduce 
Non-Federal match by up to 10% for both PROTECT Formula and 
Discretionary Grant projects (23 U.S.C. 176(e)(1)(B)). FHWA's Office of 
Natural Environment will continue to support ad-hoc resilience and 
planning technical assistance for State DOTs and MPOs on a variety of 
topics during the PRA covered time frame. These activities may include 
voluntary virtual or in-person peer exchanges. Participants choosing to 
enroll in a peer exchange are asked to submit a pre-event 
questionnaire.
    Lastly, FHWA is required by 23 U.S.C. 176(f)(1) to establish 
effectiveness metrics and evaluation procedures for the PROTECT 
Discretionary Grant Program and select a representative sample of 
projects to evaluate with these metrics. FHWA will select a 
representative sample of up to 50 funded projects to evaluate their 
impact and effectiveness to fulfil this statutory requirement. Projects 
selected as part of this representative sample will have additional 
reporting requirements.
    Burden estimates for each of these PROTECT program components are 
described below:

Grant Application, Agreement, Implementation and Evaluation Phase 
Activities

Grant Application Phase

    Eligible entities that may apply for PROTECT Discretionary grants 
vary depending on the type of the competitive grant. Planning Grants, 
Resilience Improvement Grants, and Community Resilience and Evacuation 
Route Grants have the same statutory rules for eligible applicants. The 
At-Risk Coastal Infrastructure Grant category has different statutory 
rules for eligible applicants. During the application process 
applicants will provide a project narrative and budget information, 
Standard Form 424, and Disclosure of Lobbying Activities form (SF-LLL).

--Respondents: PROTECT Grant applicants.
--Frequency: One time per grant application.
--Estimated Average Burden per Response: 166 hours for a Planning Grant 
application activities, 217 hours for a Resilience Improvement Grant 
application, 217 hours for a Community Resilience and Evacuation Routes 
Grant application, and 117 hours for an At-Risk Coastal Infrastructure 
Grant application.
--Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: It is expected that 600 
respondents will complete approximately one application during the 3-
year PRA period for an estimated total of 107,926 annual burden hours.

Grant Agreement Phase

    All grant recipients must work with FHWA to develop and execute a 
grant agreement detailing terms and conditions for use of funds.
    Respondents: All Grant Recipients.
    Frequency: One time, unless a grant agreement amendment is 
necessary.
    Estimated Burden: Approximately 30 hours per respondent. Some 
capital projects may need to process amendments to the grant agreement 
which is expected to take an additional 10-15 hours per amendment.

Grant Implementation Phase

    During the grant implementation phase, the grantee completes semi-
annual progress and recertification reports to ensure the project 
budget and schedule are maintained to the maximum extent possible, that 
compliance with Federal regulations are met, and the project is 
completed to the highest degree of quality. Post-award reporting 
responsibilities include Semi-Annual Performance Progress Reports 
(FHWA-PPR), and a financial status

[[Page 55235]]

report called the SF-425 (also known as the Federal Financial Report or 
SF-FFR). Semi-Annual Project Progress Reports are submitted as an 
attachment to the SF-425 form. Additionally, grant recipients 
requesting advance or reimbursement need to provide an SF 270 and an SF 
271 form, respectively. After project close and no later than 120 days 
after the end of the period of performance, grant recipients submit a 
Final Project Progress Report and Recertification, including a final 
Federal Financial Report (SF-425).
    Respondents: All Grant recipients:

--Frequency: Semi-Annually During the period of performance; one Final 
Progress Report after project close.
--Estimated Burden Hours: Grantees provide a FHWA Project Progress 
Report (FHWA-PPR) as an attachment to their Federal Financial Report 
(SF 425). Approximately 1 hour for each form.
--Approximately 1 additional hour each time an SF 270 and an SF 271 are 
used for an advance or reimbursement.

Grant Evaluation Phase

    During the evaluation phase, reporting is necessary to comply with 
2 CFR 200.301, to assess program effectiveness for the Federal 
Government, and to provide information regarding how the project is 
achieving the outcomes that grantees have targeted. Grantees collect 
both baseline and project performance measure data unique to their 
project as outlined in their grant agreement, and report on their 
chosen performance measure(s) via an Annual Performance Report (see 
Grant Agreement Schedule G--Performance Measurement). Annual 
Performance Reports are submitted electronically to FHWA for three 
years post project completion for all project types, followed by a 
final performance report.

    Respondents: All Grant Recipients:

--Frequency: Annually during a 3-year period of performance
--Estimated Burden: Approximately 2 hours per year.

    Total burden hours for PROTECT Competitive Grant agreement, 
implementation, and evaluation phases (all recipients):

--Over the three-year PRA period, FHWA estimates that it will take 
approximately 42 hours to complete all the post-award activities 
outlined above for a Planning Grant, 96 hours to for a Resilience 
Improvement Grant, 96 hours for a Community Resilience and Evacuation 
Route Grant, and 96 hours for an At-Risk Coastal Infrastructure Grant. 
FHWA estimates that 200 award recipients will perform these reporting 
activities during the 3-year PRA period, which will result in 16,500 
total burden hours.

Resilience Improvement Plans and Related Technical Assistance

    Resilience Improvement Plans, resilience planning peer exchanges, 
and FHWA on-demand planning and resilience technical assistance are all 
voluntary activities completed by State DOTs and MPOs that occur on an 
ad-hoc frequency. Resilience Improvement Plans are estimated to require 
250 hours to complete. Resilience Planning Peer Exchange pre-event 
questionnaires require approximately 1 hour. Information collections to 
support related FHWA resilience technical assistance activities will 
vary widely. Generally, these activities may include electronic or in-
person submission of project plans and designs, draft technical 
materials, and PowerPoint materials from a State DOT or MPO to FHWA and 
a peer group. FHWA may conduct informal interviews, focus groups or 
additional short electronic questionnaires to support these technical 
assistance activities and gauge interest in future trainings and 
assistance offerings.
    Respondents: State Departments of Transportation and Metropolitan 
Planning Organizations.
    Frequency: One time.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: It is estimated that 25 State 
DOTs and 25 MPOs will complete Resilience Improvement Plans during the 
3-year PRA period for an estimated total of 12,500 annual burden hours. 
FHWA estimates that approximately 350 participants will complete a peer 
exchange pre-event questionnaire for an FHWA peer exchange event, 
resulting in an estimated total of 350 burden hours.

PROTECT Metrics and Program Evaluation Activities

    A smaller number of grantees selected for further monitoring to 
support an FHWA Evidence Act Program Evaluation and fulfill FHWA's 
obligations under 23 U.S.C. 176(f)(1)(B) will need to coordinate with 
FHWA to provide baseline data in the pre-construction phase. These 
grantees will also assist FHWA in gathering annual post-construction 
project performance data for 3-5 years. Participants may be asked to 
attend interviews and focus groups to verify desktop, primary source, 
or field measurement data collected by FHWA. This selected sample of 50 
projects will also be administered a survey via electronic form 
submittal. The survey is estimated to take 0.5 hours to complete. Since 
FHWA may allow additional projects to voluntarily participate in the 
survey, we are estimating a high end of survey participants with up to 
all 200 grantees electing to participate in the survey.

--Respondents: A representative sample of up to 50 selected grantees 
are expected to participate in the PROTECT Discretionary Resilience 
Metrics and Program Evaluation data collection.
--Frequency: One-time baseline data collection followed by annual data 
project monitoring with FHWA for three to five years after project 
completion.
--Estimated Average Burden per Response: FHWA estimates 25 hours of 
burden annually per selected project for data collection and 
coordination with FHWA for construction projects, and 6 hours of 
coordination needed annually for planning grants. An additional 15 
hours of burden in the first year for notification, initial 
coordination with FHWA and baseline data collection. The evaluation 
team will hold quarterly update calls for each project that will take 1 
hour. The one-time survey of up to 200 grantees is estimated to take 
0.5 hours to complete. Projects selected for metrics monitoring will 
also be asked to participate in up to 2 in-depth interviews or focus 
groups.
--Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: These activities are expected to 
have an estimated total of 2,792 annual burden hours during the PRA 
period.
