SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As part of its continuing effort to reduce 
paperwork burdens, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 
1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), the FCC invited the general public and 
other Federal Agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the 
following information collection. Comments are requested concerning: 
(a) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the 
proper performance of the functions of the Commission, including 
whether the information shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy

utility, and clarity of the information collected; and (d) ways to 
minimize the burden of the collection of information on the

Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198, see 44 U.S.C. 
3506(c)(4), the FCC seeks specific comment on how it might further 
reduce the information collection burden for small business concerns 
with fewer than 25 employees.
    OMB Control Number: 3060-0853.
    Title: Certification by Administrative Authority to Billed Entity 
Compliance with the Children's internet Protection Act Form, FCC Form

    Estimated Time per Response: 1 hour for FCC Form 479, 1 hour for

Statutory authority for this information collection is contained in 47 
U.S.C. 151, 154(i), 155, 201, 205, 214, 219, 220, 254, 303(r), 403, and 
1302.
    Total Annual Burden: 78,319 hours.
    Total Annual Cost: No cost.
    Needs and Uses: The Commission will submit this information 
collection to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is an 
extension of a currently approved collection, to obtain a full three-
year clearance from OMB. The requirements contained herein are 
necessary to implement the Congressional mandate for universal service. 
It provides the Commission and USAC with the necessary information to 
administer the E-Rate program, determine the amount of support entities 
seeking funding are eligible to receive, to determine if entities are 
complying with the Commission's rules, and to prevent waste, fraud, and 
abuse. The information will also allow the Commission to evaluate the 
extent to which the E-Rate program is meeting the statutory objectives 
specified in section 254 of the 1996 Act, the Commission's performance 
goals established in the 2014 First and Second E-Rate Orders, and to 
evaluate the need and feasibility for any future revisions to program 
rules.
    FCC Form 486 was revised. On July 29, 2024 the Commission released 
a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (WC Docket 
No. 21-31, FCC 24-76) (2024 Wi-Fi Hotspots Order); finding that the 
off-premises use of wireless internet services and the Wi-Fi hotspot 
devices needed to deliver the services; serves an educational purpose 
and are eligible for E-Rate support. The 2024 Wi-Fi Hotspots Order, 89 
FR 67303, August 20, 2024, would have added the following 
certifications to the FCC Form 486: applicants that receive support for 
Wi-Fi hotspots and service for off-premises use uses the FCC Form 486 
to certify that they have updated and publicly posted their 
``acceptable use policy (AUP)'' consistent with the requirements in 47 
CFR 54.516(f); the Wi-Fi hotspots and/or services the school, library, 
or consortium purchased using E-Rate support for off-premises use have 
been activated and made available to students, school staff, and/or 
library patrons; public notice of their availability has been provided; 
and the authorized person is not requesting reimbursement for Wi-Fi 
hotspots and/or services that have not been made available for 
distribution. On September 30, 2025, the Commission adopted the 
Hotspots Order on Reconsideration (WC Docket No. 21-31, FCC 25-62) 
(Hotspots Order on Reconsideration), that rescinds the 2024 Wi-Fi 
Hotspots Order, and removes the eligibility of E-Rate support for off-
premises use of wireless mobile internet services and the Wi-Fi hotspot 
devices needed to deliver the services. The Wi-Fi hotspots and service-
related rules, including the certifications, are no longer applicable 
and are removed from this information collection.
    The hourly burden will increase by 10,044 hours for FCC Forms 479, 
486, and 500. The public burden for the collection contained herein 
will increase to 78,319 burden hours.
    FCC Form 486 ``Receipt of Service Confirmation and Certification of 
Compliance with the Children's internet Protection Act.'' After the 
Administrator reviews the funding request and commits to fund the 
eligible equipment and/or services requested, applicants use the FCC 
Form 486 to notify USAC of their service start dates for their funding 
requests. Universal service support will not be paid on an approved 
funding commitment prior to receipt of the FCC Form 486.
    Billed entities also use the FCC Form 486 to certify compliance 
with the Children's internet Protection Act (CIPA), see 47 U.S.C. 254 
(h)-(l), or qualification for a CIPA exemption when they seek discounts 
for category one services (i.e., internet access) and category two 
services (i.e., internal connections, managed internal broadband 
services, or basic maintenance of internal connections). When the 
billed entities are members of a larger consortia, they individually 
certify CIPA compliance by submitting the FCC Form 479 ``Certification 
by Administrative Authority to Billed

[[Page 54686]]

Entity of Compliance with Children's internet Protection Act'' to the 
consortium leader. The consortium leader can then file the FCC Form 486 
certifying CIPA compliance on behalf of the consortia. CIPA requires 
schools and libraries that have computers with internet access to 
certify that they have in place certain internet safety policies and 
technology protection measures to be eligible to receive program 
services under section 254(h) of the Act. See also 47 CFR 54.520. The 
FCC Form 486 is also a necessary prerequisite for invoicing and 
payment.
    FCC Form 500 ``Funding Commitment Adjustment Request.'' The FCC 
Form 500 is used by E-Rate participants to make adjustments to 
previously filed forms, such as changing the contract expiration date 
noted on the FCC Form 471, changing the funding year service start date 
listed on the FCC Form 486, cancelling or reducing the amount of a 
funding request, and extending the service delivery deadline for non-
recurring services.
    All of the requirements contained in this information collection 
are necessary to implement the Congressional mandate for the E-Rate 
program and reimbursement process.
