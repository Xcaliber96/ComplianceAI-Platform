[Docket No. FAA-2025-0470; Project Identifier MCAI-2024-00579-T; 
Amendment 39-23165; AD 2025-20-12]
RIN 2120-AA64


Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-02-
18, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 
airplanes. AD 2023-02-18 required revising the existing maintenance or 
inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more 
restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-02-
18, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness 
limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require certain actions 
in AD 2023-02-18, and requires revising the existing maintenance or 
inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more 
restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to 
address the unsafe condition on these products.

DATES: This AD is effective December 30, 2025.
    The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by 
reference of a certain publication listed in this AD as of December 30, 
2025.
    The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by 
reference of a certain other publication listed in this AD as of March 
23, 2023 (88 FR 10020, February 16, 2023).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 
CFR part 39 to supersede AD 2023-02-18, Amendment 39-22325 (88 FR 
10020, February 16, 2023) (AD 2023-02-18). AD 2023-02-18 applied to 
certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2023-02-18 
required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as 
applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness 
limitations. The FAA issued AD 2023-02-18 to address the potential 
failure of certain life-limited parts, which could result in reduced 
structural integrity of the airplane.
    The NPRM was published in the Federal Register on March 21, 2025 
(90 FR 13311). The NPRM was prompted by AD 2024-0189, dated October 1, 
2024, issued by EASA, which is the Technical Agent for the Member 
States of the European Union (EASA AD 2024-0189) (also referred to as 
the MCAI). The MCAI states that new or more restrictive airworthiness 
limitations have been developed.
    In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to continue to require certain 
actions in AD 2023-02-18 and to require revising the existing 
maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or 
more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in EASA AD 
2024-0189. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition 
on these products.
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2025-0470.

Discussion of Final Airworthiness Directive

Comments

    The FAA received a comment from the Air Line Pilots Association, 
International (ALPA), who supported the NPRM without change.
    The FAA also received a comment from ProTech Aero Services Limited. 
The following presents the comments received on the NPRM and the FAA's 
response to each comment.

Request To Confirm Intent To Allow Later Approved Revisions

    ProTech Aero Services requested confirmation that the FAA intended 
to allow the use of later approved revisions of service information to 
comply with the proposed AD. The commenter noted that EASA AD 2024-0189 
states that it allows use of later approved revisions in the Ref. 
Publications section.
    The FAA confirms that it intends to allow the use of applicable 
later Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) revisions to comply with 
the requirements of this AD. This AD refers to EASA AD 2024-0189 as the 
appropriate source of service information for accomplishing the

[[Page 53207]]

required actions. EASA AD 2024-0189 includes the Ref. Publications 
section which accepts the use of later approved variations or revisions 
of the referenced ALS document for compliance. Therefore, applicable 
later approved ALS revisions are acceptable.

Conclusion

    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority 
of another country and are approved for operation in the United States. 
Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design 
Authority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant 
data, considered any comments received, and determined that air safety 
requires adopting this AD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing 
this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Except for 
minor editorial changes, this AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. 
None of the changes will increase the economic burden on any operator.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2024-0189, which specifies new or more 
restrictive airworthiness limitations for airplane structures and safe 
life limits.
    This AD also requires EASA AD 2022-0124, dated June 28, 2022, which 
the Director of the Federal Register approved for incorporation by 
reference as of March 23, 2023 (88 FR 10020, February 16, 2023).
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 34 airplanes of U.S. 
registry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:
    The FAA estimates the total cost per operator for the retained 
actions from AD 2023-02-18 to be $7,650 (90 work-hours x $85 per work-
hour).
    The FAA has determined that revising the existing maintenance or 
inspection program takes an average of 90 work-hours per operator, 
although the agency recognizes that this number may vary from operator 
to operator. Since operators incorporate maintenance or inspection 
program changes for their affected fleet(s), the FAA has determined 
that a per-operator estimate is more accurate than a per-airplane 
estimate.
    The FAA estimates the total cost per operator for the new actions 
to be $7,650 (90 work-hours x $85 per work-hour).

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, 
on the relationship between the national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various 
levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
