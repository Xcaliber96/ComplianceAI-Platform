Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-14-
03, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -
115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -231, 
-232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -
213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2016-14-03 required reinforcing the 
forward pressure bulkhead at a certain stringer on both the left-hand 
and right-hand sides and doing related investigative and corrective 
actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2016-14-03, new crack 
findings have prompted the need for repetitive inspections of the area. 
This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2016-14-03, adds 
repetitive inspections of structure at a certain frame and applicable 
corrective actions, provides a terminating action for the repetitive 
inspections, and revises the applicability by removing airplanes and 
adding certain airplane models. The FAA is issuing this AD to address 
the unsafe condition on these products.

DATES: This AD is effective January 2, 2026.
    The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by 
reference of a certain publication listed in this AD as of January 2, 
2026.

ADDRESSES: 
    AD Docket: You may examine the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 
CFR part 39 to supersede AD 2016-14-03, Amendment 39-18584 (81 FR 
44496, July 8, 2016) (AD 2016-14-03). AD 2016-14-03 applied to all 
Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 
airplanes;

[[Page 54560]]

Model A320-211, -212, -214, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model 
A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 
2016-14-03 required reinforcing the forward pressure bulkhead at a 
certain stringer on both the left-hand and right-hand sides and doing 
related investigative and corrective actions if necessary. The FAA 
issued AD 2016-14-03 to prevent fatigue cracking of the forward 
pressure bulkhead, which could result in reduced structural integrity 
of the airplane.
    The NPRM was published in the Federal Register on March 27, 2025 
(90 FR 13848). The NPRM was prompted by AD 2024-0147R1, dated August 7, 
2024 (EASA AD 2024-0147R1) (also referred to as ``the MCAI''), issued 
by EASA, which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the 
European Union. The MCAI states that after EASA AD 2014-0209 was 
issued, several findings of cracks were reported in service during 
application of Airworthiness Limitation Item (ALI) tasks 532166 and 
533186. As a result of these findings, Airbus has developed different 
thresholds and inspection requirements compared to those specified in 
ALI tasks 532166 and 533186 and requires those inspections until a 
modification is done.
    In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to continue to require the actions in 
AD 2016-14-03. The FAA also proposed to add repetitive inspections of 
structure at a certain frame and applicable corrective actions, provide 
a terminating action for the repetitive inspections, and revise the 
applicability by removing airplanes and adding certain airplane models, 
as specified in EASA AD 2024-0147R1. The FAA is issuing this AD to 
address the unsafe condition on these airplane products.
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2025-0479.

Discussion of Final Airworthiness Directive

Comments

    The FAA received a comment from United Airlines who supported the 
NPRM without change.
    The FAA received additional comments from American Airlines 
(American), Delta Air Lines (Delta), and ProTech Aero Services Limited 
(ProTech). The following presents the comments received on the NPRM and 
the FAA's response to each comment.

Request To Confirm Use of Later Revisions Is Allowed

    ProTech requested the FAA confirm that the proposed AD would allow 
the use of later-approved revisions of the material specified in EASA 
AD 2024-0147R1, as acceptable for compliance with the AD requirements.
    This AD does allow the use of later-approved revisions of the 
material referenced in EASA AD 2024-0147R1 as acceptable for compliance 
with the required actions. This AD adopts the ``Ref. Publications'' 
section of EASA AD 2024-0147R1, which includes the current version of 
the referenced material as well as later approved revisions.

Request To Provide Credit for Actions Accomplished per a Certain 
Service Bulletin

    Delta requested the FAA confirm that accomplishment of Airbus 
Service Bulletin A320-53-1372, dated May 15, 2018, instead of Airbus 
Service Bulletin A320-53-1268, Revision 03, dated May 7, 2015, suffices 
for taking credit for paragraph (4) of EASA AD 2024-0147R1. If the FAA 
agrees, then Delta requested the FAA add a new exception to paragraph 
(h) of the proposed AD to specify, where paragraph (4) of EASA AD 2024-
0147R1 states ``in accordance with the instructions of Airbus Service 
Bulletin A320-53-1268,'' this AD considers Airbus Service Bulletin 
A320-53-1372 as acceptable for compliance. Delta requested the new 
exception because paragraph (4) of the EASA AD 2024-0147R1 does not 
mention Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1372, and the FAA's NPRM does 
not address Delta's concern. Delta stated it received an acceptable 
method of compliance (AMOC) to FAA AD 2016-14-03 (via AMOC Letter No. 
AIR-676-18-307, dated July 20, 2018) that allowed use of Airbus Service 
Bulletin A320-53-1372 instead of Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1268 
and would like to take credit for previous compliance actions for its 
applicable airplanes.
    The FAA partially agrees. The FAA agrees that, for certain airplane 
serial numbers, the modification specified in paragraph (3) of EASA AD 
2024-0147R1 may be accomplished using the original issue of Airbus 
Service Bulletin A320-53-1372, dated May 15, 2018, or later approved 
revisions, but disagrees that an exception is needed to provide credit 
for accomplishing the modification using the original issue of that 
service bulletin before the effective date of this AD. EASA AD 2024-
0147R1 defines ``the applicable modification SB'' as Airbus Service 
Bulletin A320-53-1268, Revision 01, or Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-
1372, as applicable to the manufacturer serial number. Since no 
revision number is cited for Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1372 in 
the definition, this means operators may use any revision of the 
service bulletin specified in the ``Ref. Publications'' paragraph of 
the EASA AD, as applicable, to accomplish the modification. However, 
paragraph (4) of EASA AD 2024-0147R1 is necessary to provide credit for 
any modification done before the effective date of this AD using the 
original issue of Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1268, dated January 
8, 2013, because the definition only cites Revision 01 of that service 
bulletin. The FAA has not changed the AD in this regard.
    The FAA clarifies that AMOCs approved previously for AD 2016-14-03 
are approved as AMOCs for the corresponding provisions of EASA AD 2024-
0147R1 that are required by paragraph (g) of this AD. The FAA has 
revised paragraph (i) of this AD accordingly.

Request To Correct Part Numbers

    American requested the FAA revise the proposed AD to allow use of 
the correct part numbers as an AMOC to certain part numbers specified 
in Figure A-GBAAG--Sheet 02 of Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1383, 
dated March 5, 2019. American stated that, while incorporating changes 
found in Airbus Service Bulletin Information Transmission (SBIT) 19-
0038, Revision 03, dated February 10, 2025, it found an error in the 
figure, and Airbus confirmed that certain part numbers in the tables 
and instructions for COMPD07 of subtasks 531383-420-202-001 and 531383-
420-204-001 should be corrected.
    The FAA agrees there is an error in Airbus Service Bulletin A320-
53-1383, dated March 5, 2019, but no change to this AD is necessary. 
The FAA reviewed the service bulletin and determined that Figure A-
GBAAG Sheet 02 is not required for compliance. Subtasks 531383-420-202-
001 and 531383-420-204-001 provide procedures to wet install fasteners 
in accordance with Structural Repair Manual (SRM) 51-42-00, but they 
only reference the figure and an airplane maintenance manual (AMM) task 
for additional information. Since the service bulletin does not specify 
that the fastener installation must be done in accordance with the 
figure, operators are not required to use the part numbers identified 
in the figure. Operators may instead use the correct part numbers 
identified in Airbus Message 81581889/005, Discrepancy in Figure A-
GBAAG Sheet 02, dated April 24, 2025, to comply with the requirements 
of this AD. Further, Airbus's response to American

[[Page 54561]]

indicated the part numbers would be corrected in a later revision of 
the service bulletin, which may be used for compliance according to the 
``Ref. Publications'' section of EASA AD 2024-0147R1. The FAA has not 
changed the AD in this regard.

Request To Correct a Typographical Error

    Delta requested the FAA revise the exception in paragraph (h)(4) of 
the proposed AD by changing ``herein'' to ``therein.'' Delta stated 
paragraph (6) of EASA AD 2024-0147R1 uses ``herein'' to specify the 
compliance times for repair instructions provided by Airbus based on 
inspection findings after accomplishing ALI tasks 532166 and 533186. 
Delta believes ``herein'' is a typographical error because the EASA AD 
does not mention any compliance times for the ALI tasks inspection 
findings. Delta stated that repair instructions and compliance times as 
a result of the ALI inspection findings should be specified in the 
appropriate Airbus Repair Design Approval Forms (RDAFs).
    The FAA does not agree that usage of ``herein'' in EASA AD 2024-
0147R1 and paragraph (h)(4) of this AD is a typographical error. 
Paragraph (6) of the EASA AD applies to airplanes that have been 
inspected per ALI task 532166 and/or 533186 and repaired using Airbus 
approved instructions. The FAA clarifies that, for these airplanes, 
paragraph (6) of the EASA AD specifies accomplishing the repetitive 
inspections of each repaired hole in accordance with the applicable 
Airbus approved instructions within the compliance time ``herein,'' 
where herein refers to table 1 of the EASA AD for the applicable 
inspection compliance times. The FAA has not revised the AD in this 
regard.

Request To Calculate Compliance Time Based on Accomplishment of a 
Certain Task

    Delta requested the FAA add an exception to paragraph (h) of the 
proposed AD to allow the compliance time in table 1 of EASA AD 2024-
0147R1 to be calculated based on accomplishment of ALI task 532166-01-1 
instead of ALI task 532166-02-1. Delta noted that ALI task 532166-02-1 
states the task is an alternative to ALI task 532166-01-1, and that it 
accomplishes ALI task 532166-01-1 instead of ALI task 532166-02-1. 
Since Airbus has stipulated that the task is alternative, Delta 
therefore concluded that the compliance time may also be calculated 
using ALI task 532166-01-1 instead of ALI task 532166-02-1.
    The FAA does not agree with the request. EASA AD 2024-0147R1 does 
not list ALI task 532166-01-1 as an alternate inspection task in Table 
1--Initial Inspection. Further, ALI task 532166-02-1 is a special 
detailed inspection (rototest), while ALI task 532166-01-1 is a visual 
inspection. The FAA has not changed this AD in this regard.

Conclusion

    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority 
of another country and are approved for operation in the United States. 
Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design 
Authority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant 
data, considered any comments received, and determined that air safety 
requires adopting this AD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing 
this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Except for 
minor editorial changes, and any other changes described previously, 
this AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. None of the changes will 
increase the economic burden on any operator.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2024-0147R1, which specifies procedures 
for repetitive inspections for cracking of the airplane structure at 
frame (FR) 35 and stringer (STGR) 30 on the left-hand and right-hand 
sides for Airbus SAS Model A318, Model A319, and Model A320 airplanes; 
and at FR 35.8 and STGR 30 on the left-hand and right-hand sides for 
Airbus SAS Model A321 airplanes. EASA AD 2024-0147R1 also specifies 
obtaining and following instructions for crack repair. EASA AD 2024-
0147R1 specifies that accomplishment of that inspection on an airplane 
terminates ALI tasks 532166 and task 533186 requirements.
    EASA AD 2024-0147R1 also specifies procedures for modifying the 
forward pressure bulkhead at the frame coupling on the left-hand and 
right-hand sides of FR 35 and STGR 30, including applicable related 
investigative and corrective actions, for Airbus SAS Model A318, Model 
A319, and Model A320 airplanes; and at FR 35.8 and STGR 30 for Airbus 
SAS Model A321 airplanes. EASA AD 2024-0147R1 specifies that this 
modification constitutes terminating action for the repetitive 
inspections for that airplane.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 1,922 airplanes of U.S. 
registry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:
    The FAA estimates that it would take up to 21 work-hours per 
product to comply with the retained actions from AD 2016-14-03. The 
average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. Based on these figures, FAA 
estimates the cost for U.S. operators is up to $3,430,770, or up to 
$1,785 per product.
    The FAA estimates that it would take up to 11 work-hours per 
product to comply with the new proposed actions. The average labor rate 
is $85 per work-hour. Based on these figures, FAA estimates the cost 
for U.S. operators is up to $1,797,070, or up to $935 per product.
    The FAA has received no definitive data on which to base the cost 
estimates for the on-condition actions specified in this AD.
    According to the manufacturer, some or all of the costs of this AD 
may be covered under warranty, thereby reducing the cost impact on 
affected individuals. The FAA does not control warranty coverage for 
affected individuals. As a result, the FAA has included all known costs 
in the cost estimate.

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, 
on the relationship between the national

[[Page 54562]]

government and the States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

(e) Unsafe Condition

    This AD was prompted by the need to complete certain mandated 
programs intended to support the airplane reaching its limit of 
validity (LOV) of the engineering data that support the established 
structural maintenance program. This AD was also prompted by reports 
that during inspections accomplished as specified in certain 
Airworthiness Limitation Items (ALIs), cracks were detected on the 
fastener holes at frame (FR) 35 or FR 35.8 between stringers (STGRs) 
28 and 31. The FAA is issuing this AD to prevent fatigue cracking on 
the forward pressure bulkhead. The unsafe condition, if not 
addressed, could result in reduced structural integrity of the 
fuselage.

(f) Compliance

    Comply with this AD within the compliance times specified, 
unless already done.

(g) Requirements

    Except as specified in paragraph (h) of this AD: Comply with all 
required actions and compliance times specified in, and in 
accordance with, EASA AD 2024-0147R1.

(h) Exceptions to EASA AD 2024-0147R1

    (1) Where EASA AD 2024-0147R1 refers to its effective date, this 
AD requires using the effective date of this AD.
    (2) Where paragraph (2) of EASA AD 2024-0147R1 specifies ``If, 
during any inspection as required by paragraph (1) of this AD, 
discrepancies are detected, before next flight, contact Airbus to 
obtain approved instructions for corrective action and accomplish 
those instructions accordingly'', this AD requires replacing that 
text with the following: ``If, during any inspection as required by 
paragraph (1) of this AD, any cracking is detected, the cracking 
must be repaired before further flight using a method approved by 
the Manager, AIR-520, Continued Operational Safety Branch, FAA; or 
EASA; or Airbus SAS's EASA Design Organization Approval (DOA). If 
approved by the DOA, the approval must include the DOA-authorized 
signature.''
    (3) Where EASA AD 2024-0147R1 refers to ``03 October 2014 [the 
effective date of EASA AD 2014-0209],'' this AD requires using 
August 12, 2016 (the effective date of AD 2016-14-03).
    (4) Where paragraph (6) of EASA AD 2024-0147R1 specifies 
``repaired using Airbus approved instructions, accomplish the 
(repetitive) inspection for each repaired hole in accordance with 
the applicable Airbus approved instructions within the compliance 
time herein specified'', this AD requires replacing that text with 
the following: ``repaired using a method approved by the Manager, 
AIR-520, Continued Operational Safety Branch, FAA; or EASA; or 
Airbus SAS's EASA DOA, provided the DOA approval includes the DOA-
authorized signature: accomplish the (repetitive) inspection for 
each repaired hole in accordance with the applicable approved 
instructions within the compliance time herein specified.''
    (5) This AD does not adopt the ``Remarks'' section of EASA AD 
2024-0147R1.

(i) Additional AD Provisions

    The following provisions also apply to this AD:
    (1) Alternative Methods of Compliance (AMOCs): The Manager, AIR-
520, Continued Operational Safety Branch, FAA, has the authority to 
approve AMOCs for this AD, if requested using the procedures found 
in 14 CFR 39.19. In accordance with 14 CFR 39.19, send your request 
to your principal inspector or responsible Flight Standards Office, 
as appropriate. If sending information directly to the manager of 
the Continued Operational Safety Branch, send it to the attention of 
the person identified in paragraph (j) of this AD and email to: 
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#094844464a496f6868276e667f"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fabbb7b5b9ba9c9b9bd49d958c">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
    (i) Before using any approved AMOC, notify your appropriate 
principal inspector, or lacking a principal inspector, the manager 
of the responsible Flight Standards Office.
    (ii) AMOCs approved previously for AD 2016-14-03 are approved as 
AMOCs for the corresponding provisions of EASA AD 2024-0147R1 that 
are required by paragraph (g) of this AD.
    (2) Contacting the Manufacturer: For any requirement in this AD 
to obtain instructions from a manufacturer, the instructions must be 
accomplished using a method approved by the Manager, AIR-520, 
Continued Operational Safety Branch, FAA; or EASA; or Airbus SAS's 
EASA DOA. If approved by the DOA, the approval must include the DOA-
authorized signature.
    (3) Required for Compliance (RC): Except as required by 
paragraph (i)(2) of this AD, if any material contains procedures or 
tests that are identified as RC, those procedures and tests must be 
done to comply with this AD; any procedures or tests that are not 
identified as RC are recommended. Those procedures and tests that 
are not identified as RC may be deviated from using accepted methods 
in accordance with the operator's maintenance or inspection program 
without obtaining approval of an AMOC, provided the procedures and 
tests identified as RC can be done and the airplane can be put back 
in an airworthy condition. Any substitutions or changes to 
procedures or tests identified as RC require approval of an AMOC.
