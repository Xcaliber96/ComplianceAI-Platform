FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION

12 CFR Part 328

RIN 3064-AF26


FDIC Official Signs and Advertising Requirements, False 
Advertising, Misrepresentation of Insured Status, and Misuse of the 
FDIC's Name or Logo

AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

ACTION: Final rule; delay of compliance date.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: On December 20, 2023, the FDIC adopted a final rule that, 
among other things, amended the FDIC's official sign and advertisement 
of membership requirements for insured depository institutions (IDIs). 
The current compliance date for requirements related to displaying the 
official digital sign on IDIs' digital deposit-taking channels and 
automated teller machines (ATMs) and like devices is March 1, 2026. The 
FDIC is delaying the March 1, 2026, compliance date to January 1, 2027. 
This delay will provide certainty and minimize undue burden on IDIs 
while the FDIC completes consideration of a proposal to amend 
requirements related to digital deposit-taking channels and ATMs and 
like devices.

DATES: The compliance date for the requirements in 12 CFR 328.4 and 
328.5, which was initially delayed at 89 FR 84261 (October 22, 2024) 
and was subsequently delayed at 90 FR 11659 (March 11, 2025), is 
further delayed to January 1, 2027.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 20, 2023, the FDIC adopted a 
final rule \1\ revising the official sign and advertising regulations 
implementing section 18(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 89 FR 3504.
    \2\ 12 U.S.C. 1828(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The final rule became effective on April 1, 2024, and required full 
compliance with the rule by January 1, 2025. Based upon feedback from 
IDIs and other industry participants, the FDIC delayed the compliance 
date for the amendments in subpart A of 12 CFR part 328 to May 1, 
2025.\3\ The delay was intended to provide additional time for IDIs to 
put in place processes and systems and make technological updates. In 
March 2025, the compliance date was further delayed as to the 
requirements in 12 CFR 328.4 and 328.5.\4\ This second delay recognized 
that the requirements of 12 CFR 328.4 and 328.5, relating to signage 
requirements for digital deposit-taking channels and ATMs and like 
devices, continued to generate questions regarding implementation and 
had the potential to cause consumer confusion. The delay allowed the 
FDIC to consider proposing changes to these requirements, which it did 
on August 21, 2025.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ 89 FR 84261 (Oct. 22, 2024).
    \4\ 90 FR 11659 (Mar. 11, 2025).
    \5\ 90 FR 40767.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Specifically, on August 21, 2025, the FDIC issued a notice of 
proposed rulemaking seeking comment on a proposal that would amend the 
requirements of 12 CFR 328.4 and 328.5 to minimize identified 
implementation issues, reduce burden, and address potential consumer 
confusion. Given that the FDIC is considering changes to 12 CFR 328.4 
and 328.5, the approaching March 1, 2026, compliance deadline for the 
present requirements of 12 CFR 328.4 and 328.5 has created uncertainty 
and could impose unnecessary burden on IDIs. To address these concerns, 
the FDIC is delaying the compliance date for the requirements in 12 CFR 
328.4 and 328.5 from March 1, 2026, to January 1, 2027.\6\ This delayed

compliance date is subject to any changes to these provisions made by 
any future rulemaking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The policies and procedures required by 12 CFR 328.8 for 
which the compliance date is May 1, 2025, will not need to address 
the requirements in 12 CFR 328.4 or 328.5, until January 1, 2027, 
the full compliance date for these provisions.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

    By order of the Board of Directors.

    Dated at Washington, DC, on November 25, 2025.
Jennifer M. Jones,
Deputy Executive Secretary.
