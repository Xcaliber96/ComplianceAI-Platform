SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    According to Section 401 of PRWORA, 8 U.S.C. 1611(a), aliens who 
are not ``qualified aliens'' are not eligible for any ``Federal public 
benefit'' as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1611(c). The prohibition set forth in 
Sec.  1611(a) is subject to certain exceptions set forth in Sec.  
1611(b).
    Section 401(c) of PRWORA, defines ``Federal public benefit'' as 
``(A) any grant, contract, loan, professional license, or commercial 
license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated 
funds of the United States'' and ``(B) any retirement, welfare, health, 
disability, public or assisted housing, postsecondary education, food 
assistance, unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit for 
which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, 
or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by 
appropriated funds of the United States.'' 8 U.S.C. 1611(c)(1). This 
definition, too, is subject to certain exceptions. See id. (c)(2) 
(setting forth certain exceptions to the definition of ``Federal public 
benefit'').
    In addition, under Section 432 of PRWORA, as amended, to the extent 
required by law, providers of a nonexempt ``Federal public benefit'' 
must verify that a person applying for the benefit is a qualified alien 
and is eligible to receive the benefit. 8 U.S.C. 1642. While the 
verification requirement is necessary for proper enforcement of PRWORA, 
it is conceptually distinct from the meaning of the term ``Federal 
public benefit'' and this notice is not intended to address the 
application of such requirement. Neither does this notice speak to 
``Federal public benefits'' that may be subject to other statutory 
authority besides PRWORA regarding citizenship and alien eligibility.
    In the list of substantive exceptions under 8 U.S.C. 1611(b)(1) 
Congress provided that the prohibition against providing non-qualified 
aliens with any federal public benefit ``shall not apply with respect 
to the following Federal public benefits:
    (B) Short-term, non-cash, in-kind emergency disaster relief [. . .] 
``(D) Programs, services, or assistance (such as soup kitchens, crisis 
counseling and intervention, and short-term shelter) specified by the 
Attorney General, in the Attorney General's sole and unreviewable 
discretion after consultation with appropriate Federal agencies and 
departments, which (i) deliver in-kind services at the community level, 
including through public or private nonprofit agencies; (ii) do not 
condition the provision of assistance, the amount of assistance 
provided, or the cost of assistance provided on the individual 
recipient's income or resources; and (iii) are necessary for the 
protection of life or safety.

II. Interpretation

    Statutory construction ``must begin, and often should end as well, 
with the language of the statute itself.'' United States v. Steele, 147 
F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir. 1998) (quoting Merritt v. Dillard, 120 F.3d 
1181, 1185 (11th Cir. 1997). ``The plain meaning controls.'' United 
States v. Robinson, 94 F.3d 1325, 1328 (9th Cir. 1996) (citation 
omitted). The statutory language is clear: if a HUD program falls into 
either Sec.  1611(c)(1)(A) or (c)(1)(B), such benefits are not 
available to individuals who are aliens, unless (i) that individual is 
a qualified alien, or (ii) some other exception applies to the HUD 
program, either under Sec.  1611(b) or via the definitional limits on 
``Federal public benefit'' set forth in (c)(2). Thus, the task is 
simple: construe the plain language of (c)(1)(A)

[[Page 54364]]

and (c)(1)(B). Those provisions state that ``Federal public benefit'' 
means:
    (A) any grant, contract, loan, professional license, or commercial 
license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated 
funds of the United States; and
    (B) any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted 
housing (emphasis added), postsecondary education, food assistance, 
unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit for which payments 
or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family 
eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated 
funds of the United States.
    If HUD ``provide[s]'' the (i) ``grant, contract, loan, professional 
license, or commercial license,'' or if the ``grant, contract, loan, 
professional license, or commercial license'' is ``provided by'' 
``appropriated funds of the United States,'' then such item is a 
``Federal public benefit.'' Similarly, if HUD ``provide[s]'' the 
``retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, 
postsecondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit, or any 
other similar benefit,'' or such ``benefit'' is ``provided'' ``by 
appropriated funds of the United States,'' then such benefit is a 
``Federal public benefit,'' as long as the benefit is ``provided to'' 
one of three types of recipients: (i) ``an individual,'' (ii) a 
``household,'' or (iii) a ``family eligibility unit.''

1. Grant

    Section 1611(c)(1)(A) applies to ``any grant, contract, loan, 
professional license, or commercial license'' provided by HUD. For 
purposes of PRWORA, a grant means the award of funding for an 
individual or entity to carry out specified activities without the 
direct involvement of HUD.
    HUD administers a multitude of grant programs, including those in 
which the grants go to individuals, private entities, and institutions 
(such as building or services grants) and those in which the grants go 
to States, units of local government as well as non-profit 
organizations. The grant ``recipient'' may carry out the activity 
supported by the grant, but sometimes the recipient may issue a 
subgrant to an individual or entity. For PRWORA purposes, the term 
``grant'' includes any ``subgrant'' derivative of a grant. Sometimes 
the activity supported by the grant is carried out by the recipient and 
sometimes the recipient acts as a ``pass-through entity'' ``that 
provides a subaward to a subrecipient to carry out part of a Federal 
program,'' 2 CFR 200.1 (definitions for uniform grants guidance for all 
Federal financial assistance), under which the obligations and 
requirements on the recipient flow down to the subrecipient.
    Section 1611 (c)(1) of PRWORA defines a ``Federal public benefit'' 
to mean ``any grant'' (emphasis added). ``Read naturally, the word 
`any' has an expansive meaning, that is, one or some indiscriminately 
of whatever kind.'' Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 219 
(2008) (cleaned up). The statutory text does not distinguish between 
grants ``to individuals'' and grants ``provided to states or 
localities.'' Contra 63 FR at 41659. And so, HUD must apply the plain 
meaning of the statutory text. E.g., Pub. Serv. Elec. & Gas Co. v. 
F.E.R.C., 989 F.3d 10, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (``[A] regulation can never 
trump the plain meaning of a statute.'') (quotes omitted).
    It is HUD's position that any grants it administers that are not 
explicitly governed by another statute are federal public benefits 
related to housing assistance and are subject to the eligibility 
requirements under PRWORA. HUD intends to revise its guidance as to 
which grant programs are deemed covered by PRWORA or by another 
statute.

2. ``Any Other Similar Benefit''

    To determine whether a HUD program provides ``any other similar 
benefit(s)'' under 8 U.S.C. 1611(c)(1)(B), it is instructive to look 
not just to the enumerated benefits within 8 U.S.C. 1611(c)(1), but 
also to the exempted Federal public benefits under 8 U.S.C. 1611(b)(1). 
Here, Congress specified under subparagraphs (B) and (D) that there are 
exemptions from the general alien restrictions of 8 U.S.C. 1611(a) for 
certain types of Federal public benefits, including non-cash benefits 
or in-kind services. In-kind is defined as ``in the same manner or with 
something equivalent'' Webster's II: New Riverside University 
Dictionary (1994). In the context of the statute, ``in-kind'' means 
some sort of non-cash benefit that provides goods or services directly, 
rather than providing cash to procure those goods or services. The 
exception under subparagraph (D) applies more specifically to in-kind 
services that are delivered ``at the community level, including through 
public or private nonprofit agencies.'' It would not make sense for 
Congress to exclude these limited non-cash or in-kind services 
explicitly in 8 U.S.C. 1611(b)(1)(B) and (D) if at least some of those 
benefits were not already captured under the operative definition of 
``Federal public benefit'' under 8 U.S.C. 1611(c). Congress would have 
no need to carve something out that would not otherwise be covered in 
the first instance under the ``Federal public benefit'' definition. As 
such, the general definition of ``Federal public benefit'' is best 
understood to include ``assistance'' similar to the ``deliver[y] [of] 
in-kind services at the community level, including through public or 
private nonprofit agencies'' where such benefits have not been 
specifically excluded by 8 U.S.C. 1611(b)(1).

III. Application to HUD Programs

    HUD interprets PRWORA to apply to all HUD programs related to 
public or assisted housing as they are ``public or assisted housing'' 
for which payments or assistance are ``provided to an individual, 
household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States 
or by appropriated funds of the United States'' unless a more specific 
federal statute applies, e.g. Section 214 of the Housing and Community 
Development Act of 1980, as amended.
    HUD has applied the provisions of PRWORA to its Community Planning 
and Development programs and grants which include Homeless Assistance 
Programs, particularly the Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) and 
Continuum of Care (CoC) programs (see 24 CFR parts 576 and 578). HUD 
considers these programs to award ``grants'' as defined in PRWORA and 
therefore covered by the definition of ``Federal public benefit'' under 
the statute. As a result, these grant programs are subject to the 
eligibility and verification provisions under PRWORA.
    The covered grant programs include, but are limited to, grants to 
governments (state and local) or to other organizations. Covered grant 
programs with governmental grantees include HOME, HOME Investment 
Partnerships American Rescue Plan (HOME-ARP), National Housing Trust 
Fund, Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), Community Development 
Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR), Housing Opportunities for 
Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) formula, and ESG, but also include Pathways 
to Removing Obstacles to Housing (PRO Housing) and Preservation and 
Reinvestment Initiative for Community Enhancement (PRICE) (both 
competitive). Programs that award grants to non-profit organizations 
include the CoC program, Congressional earmarks, the HOPWA competitive 
program, PRO Housing, PRICE and the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity 
Program (SHOP).

IV. Verification and Economic Impact

    HUD will undertake a review and revised guidance in order to 
determine the means of verification of immigration status as they 
affect those programs not exempt under Section 1611(b)(1). These will 
address those program recipients (such as States and government actors) 
who have access to the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements 
(SAVE) program as well as non-government recipients. Under PRWORA, 
although nonprofit charitable organizations that administer ``Federal 
public benefits'' are not required to conduct eligibility verification 
under 8 U.S.C. 1642(d), it does not relieve states or other 
governmental from the requirements to ensure that all relevant programs 
are in compliance with PWRORA. As a result, HUD will be issuing new 
guidelines related to the verification for benefits provided through 
its housing assistance and grant programs, including for benefits 
distributed by charitable non-profit organizations. HUD will be relying 
in guidance issued by the Department of Homeland Security once that is 
published.
    Due to the multitude of HUD programs that are available to tens of 
millions of individuals, HUD will continue to evaluate the manner in 
which it will verify compliance with PRWORA. HUD will, to the maximum 
extent possible, minimize the imposition of reporting and information 
and information collection requirements. Similarly, HUD continues to 
analyze the economic impact of this interpretation, but at this time, 
has not found there to be significant economic impact. HUD will issue 
subsequent guidance on verification actions and a final determination 
regarding the economic impact of this interpretation.
