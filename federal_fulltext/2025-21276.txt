SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Forest Service Law Enforcement and Investigations Ride-Along 
Program.
    OMB Number: 0596-0170.
    Expiration Date of Approval: July 31, 2026.
    Type of Review: Extension with no revision of a currently approved 
information collection.
    Abstract: This information collection is necessary for Forest 
Service Law Enforcement and Investigations (LEI) personnel to authorize 
a rider who applies to participate in the Ride-Along

[[Page 54285]]

Program. The information collection also provides additional protection 
for LEI personnel who allow authorized riders to accompany them in 
boats, cars, trucks, or other vehicles. The purpose of this program is 
for citizens to learn about and observe Forest Service LEI tasks and 
activities. The program is intended to enhance Forest Service law 
enforcement community relationships, improve the quality of Forest 
Service customer service, and provide LEI personnel a recruitment tool. 
A rider shall complete two forms in order to participate.
    Form FS-5300-33 asks for the participant's name, address, social 
security number, driver's license number, work address, location of the 
ride-along, and the reason for the ride-along. Law enforcement officers 
use form FS-5300-33 to conduct a minimum background check before 
authorizing a person to ride-along.
    Form FS-5300-34 is signed by riders to exempt law enforcement 
officers and the Forest Service from damage, loss, or injury liability 
incurred during the rider's participation in the program. If the 
information is not collected, riders will be denied permission to ride-
along with Forest Service law enforcement personnel.
    Affected Public: Individuals.
    Estimated Annual Burden per Response: 4 minutes.
    Estimated Annual Number of Respondents: 101.
    Estimated Annual Number of Responses per Respondent: 1.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 13 hours.

Comment Is Invited

    Comment is invited on (1) whether this collection of information is 
necessary for the stated purposes and the proper performance of the 
functions of the Agency, including whether the information will have 
practical or scientific utility; (2) the accuracy of the Agency's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information, including the 
validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance 
the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; 
and (4) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including the use of automated, electronic, mechanical, or 
other technological collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology.
    All comments received in response to this notice, including names 
and addresses when provided, will be a matter of public record. 
Comments will be summarized and included in the submission request for 
Office of Management and Budget approval.
