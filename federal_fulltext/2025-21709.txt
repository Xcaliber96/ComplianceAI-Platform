[Docket No. CP26-24-000]


Texas Eastern Transmission, LP; Notice of Application and 
Establishing Intervention Deadline

    Take notice that on November 13, 2025, Texas Eastern Transmission, 
LP (Texas Eastern, 915 North Eldridge Parkway, Suite 1100, Houston, 
Texas 77079-2703, filed an application pursuant to sections 7(b) and 
7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) and Part 157 of the Commission's 
regulations requesting authorization for its Kosciusko Compressor 
Station Replacement Project (Project) located in Attala County, 
Mississippi. Texas Eastern proposes to abandon by removal fourteen 
existing natural gas-fired reciprocating engine-driven compressor 
units, totaling 35,000 horsepower (hp) based on National Electrical 
Manufacturers Association (NEMA) rating, and related appurtenant 
facilities at its Kosciusko Compressor Station (CS) and install three 
natural gas-fired turbine-driven compressor units, totaling 42,720 hp 
based on International Organization for Standardization rating \1\ and 
auxiliary equipment. The Project is designed to ensure the continued 
safe and reliable operation of the Kosciusko CS while meeting all 
currently applicable air emissions requirements and does not involve 
any change in design capacity for Texas Eastern's system. Texas

Eastern estimates the total cost of the Project to be $225.9 million 
and requests for a pre-determination of rolled-in rates, all as more 
fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission 
and open for public inspection.

    \1\ Texas Eastern states that equivalent NEMA-rated power output

authorizations within 90 days of the date of issuance of the Commission 
staff's FEIS or EA.
