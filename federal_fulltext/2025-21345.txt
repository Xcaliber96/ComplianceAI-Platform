ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

[FRL-12987-01-OLEM]


Forty-Eighth Update of the Federal Agency Hazardous Waste 
Compliance Docket

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: Since 1988, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has 
maintained a Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket 
(``Docket'') under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA requires EPA to 
establish a Docket that contains certain information reported to EPA by 
Federal facilities that manage hazardous waste or from which a 
reportable quantity of hazardous substances has been released. This 
document identifies the Federal facilities not previously listed on the 
Docket and identifies Federal facilities reported to EPA since the last 
update on April 21, 2025. In addition to the list of additions to the 
Docket, this document includes a section with revisions of the previous 
Docket list and a section of Federal facilities that are to be deleted 
from the Docket. Thus, the revisions in this update include two 
additions, zero deletions, and zero corrections to the Docket since the 
previous update.

DATES: This list is current as of October 3, 2025.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Electronic versions of the Docket and 
more information on its implementation can be obtained at <a href="https://www.epa.gov/fedfac/federal-agency-hazardous-waste-compliance-docket">https://www.epa.gov/fedfac/federal-agency-hazardous-waste-compliance-docket</a> by

1.0 Introduction

    Section 120(c) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9620(c), as amended by the 
Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), requires 
EPA to establish the Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket. 
The Docket contains information on Federal facilities that manage 
hazardous waste and such information is submitted by Federal agencies 
to EPA under sections 3005, 3010, and 3016 of the Resource Conservation 
and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6925, 6930, and 6937. Additionally, 
the Docket contains information on Federal facilities with a reportable 
quantity of hazardous substances that has been released and such 
information is submitted by Federal agencies to EPA under section 103 
of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9603. Specifically, RCRA section 3005 establishes 
a permitting system for certain hazardous waste treatment, storage, and 
disposal (TSD) facilities; RCRA section 3010 requires waste generators, 
transporters and TSD facilities to notify EPA of their hazardous waste 
activities; and RCRA section 3016 requires Federal agencies to submit 
biennially to EPA an inventory of their Federal hazardous waste 
facilities. CERCLA section 103(a) requires the owner or operator of a 
vessel or onshore or offshore facility to notify the National Response 
Center (NRC) of any spill or other release of a hazardous substance 
that equals or exceeds a reportable quantity (RQ), as defined by CERCLA 
section 101. Additionally, CERCLA section 103(c) requires facilities 
that have ``stored, treated, or disposed of'' hazardous wastes and 
where there is ``known, suspected, or likely releases'' of hazardous 
substances to report their activities to EPA.
    CERCLA section 120(d) requires EPA to take steps to assure that a 
Preliminary Assessment (PA) be completed for those sites identified in 
the Docket and that the evaluation and listing of sites with a PA be 
completed within a reasonable time frame. The PA is designed to provide 
information for EPA to consider when evaluating the site for potential 
response action or inclusion on the National Priorities List (NPL).
    The Docket serves three major purposes: (1) to identify all Federal 
facilities that must be evaluated to determine whether they pose a 
threat to human health and the environment sufficient to warrant 
inclusion on the National Priorities List (NPL); (2) to compile and 
maintain the information submitted to EPA on such facilities under the 
provisions listed in section 120(c) of CERCLA; and (3) to provide a 
mechanism to make the information available to the public. Previous 
Docket updates are available at <a href="https://www.epa.gov/fedfac/previous-federal-agency-hazardous-waste-compliance-docket-updates">https://www.epa.gov/fedfac/previous-federal-agency-hazardous-waste-compliance-docket-updates</a>.
    This document provides some background information on the Docket. 
Additional information on the Docket requirements and implementation 
are found in the Docket Reference Manual, Federal Agency Hazardous 
Waste Compliance Docket found at <a href="https://www.epa.gov/fedfac/docket-reference-manual-federal-agency-hazardous-waste-compliance-docket-interim-final">https://www.epa.gov/fedfac/docket-reference-manual-federal-agency-hazardous-waste-compliance-docket-interim-final</a> or obtained by calling the Regional Docket Coordinators 
listed below. This document also provides changes to the list of sites 
included on the Docket in three areas: (1) Additions, (2) Deletions, 
and (3) Corrections. Specifically, additions are newly identified 
Federal facilities that have been reported to EPA since the last update 
and now are included on the Docket; the deletions section lists Federal 
facilities that EPA is deleting from the Docket.\1\ The information 
submitted to EPA on each Federal facility is maintained in the Docket 
repository located in the EPA Regional office of the Region in which 
the Federal facility is located; for a description of the information 
required under those provisions, see 53 FR 4280 (February 12, 1988). 
Each repository contains the documents submitted to EPA under the 
reporting provisions and correspondence relevant to the reporting 
provisions for each Federal facility.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See section 3.2 for the criteria for being deleted from the 
Docket.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In prior updates, information was also provided regarding No 
Further Remedial Action Planned (NFRAP) status changes. However, 
information on NFRAP and NPL status is no longer being provided 
separately in the Docket update as it is now available at: <a href="https://www.epa.gov/fedfacts/federal-facility-cleanup-sites-searchable-list">https://www.epa.gov/fedfacts/federal-facility-cleanup-sites-searchable-list</a> or

3.0 Revisions of the Previous Docket

    This section includes a discussion of the additions, deletions and 
corrections to the list of Docket facilities since the previous Docket 
update.

3.1 Additions

    These Federal facilities are being added primarily because of new 
information obtained by EPA (for example, recent reporting of a 
facility pursuant to RCRA sections 3005, 3010, or 3016 or CERCLA 
section 103). CERCLA section 120, as amended by the Defense 
Authorization Act of 1997, specifies that EPA take steps to assure that 
a Preliminary Assessment (PA) be completed within a reasonable time 
frame for those Federal facilities that are included on the Docket. 
Among other things, the PA is designed to provide information for EPA 
to consider when evaluating the site for potential response action or 
listing on the NPL. This document includes two additions.

3.2 Deletions

    There are no statutory or regulatory provisions that address 
deletion of a facility from the Docket. However, if a facility is 
incorrectly included on the Docket, it may be deleted from the Docket. 
The criteria EPA uses in deleting sites from the Docket include: a 
facility for which there was an incorrect report submitted for 
hazardous waste activity under RCRA (e.g., 40 CFR 262.44); a facility 
that was not Federally-owned or operated at the time of the listing; a 
facility included more than once (i.e., redundant listings); or when 
multiple facilities are combined under one listing. (See Docket Codes 
(Reasons for Deletion of Facilities)) for a more refined list of the 
criteria EPA uses for deleting sites from the Docket.) Facilities being 
deleted no longer will be subject to the requirements of CERCLA section 
120(d). This document includes zero deletions.

3.3 Corrections

    Changes necessary to correct the previous Docket are identified by 
both EPA and Federal agencies. The corrections section may include 
changes in addresses or spelling, and corrections of the recorded name 
and ownership of a Federal facility. In addition, changes in the names 
of Federal facilities may be made to establish consistency in the 
Docket or between the Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS) and 
the Docket. For the Federal facility for which a correction is entered, 
the original entry is as it appeared in previous Docket updates. The 
corrected update is shown directly below, for easy comparison. This 
document includes zero corrections.

4.0 Process for Compiling the Updated Docket

    In compiling the newly reported Federal facilities for the update 
being published in this document, EPA extracted the names, addresses, 
and identification numbers of facilities from four EPA databases--the 
WebEOC, the Biennial Inventory of Federal Agency Hazardous Waste 
Activities, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information 
System (RCRAInfo), and SEMS--that contain information about Federal 
facilities submitted under the four provisions listed in CERCLA section 
120(c).
    EPA assures the quality of the information on the Docket by 
conducting extensive evaluation of the current Docket list and contacts 
the other Federal Agency (OFA) with the information obtained from the 
databases identified above to determine which Federal facilities were, 
in fact, newly reported and qualified for inclusion on the update. EPA 
is also striving to correct errors for Federal facilities that were 
previously reported. For example, state-owned or privately-owned 
facilities that are not operated by the Federal government may have 
been included. Such problems are sometimes caused by procedures 
historically used to report and track Federal facilities data. 
Representatives of Federal agencies are asked to contact the EPA HQ 
Docket Coordinator at the address provided in the FOR FURTHER 
INFORMATION CONTACT section of this document if revisions of this 
update information are necessary.

5.0 Facilities Not Included

    Certain categories of facilities may not be included on the Docket, 
such as: (1) Federal facilities formerly owned by a Federal agency that 
at the time of consideration was not Federally-owned or operated; (2) 
Federal facilities that are small quantity generators (SQGs) that have 
not, more than once per calendar year, generated more than 1,000 kg of 
hazardous waste in any single month; (3) Federal facilities that are 
very small quantity generators (VSQGs) that have never generated more 
than 100 kg of hazardous waste in any month; (4) Federal facilities 
that are solely hazardous waste transportation facilities, as reported 
under RCRA section 3010; and (5) Federal facilities that have mixed 
mine or mill site ownership.
    An EPA policy issued in June 2003 provided guidance for a site-by-
site evaluation as to whether ``mixed ownership'' mine or mill sites, 
typically created as a result of activities conducted pursuant to the 
General Mining Law of 1872 and never reported under section 103(a) of 
CERCLA, should be included on the Docket. For purposes of that policy, 
mixed ownership mine or mill sites are those located partially on 
private land and partially on public land. This policy is found at 
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/fedfac/policy-listing-mixed-ownership-mine-or-mill-sites-created-result-general-mining-law-1872">https://www.epa.gov/fedfac/policy-listing-mixed-ownership-mine-or-mill-sites-created-result-general-mining-law-1872</a>. The policy of not 
including these facilities may change; facilities now omitted may be 
added at some point if EPA determines that they should be included.

6.0 Facility NPL Status Reporting, Including NFRAP Status

    EPA tracks the NPL status of Federal facilities listed on the 
Docket. An updated list of the NPL status of all Docket facilities, as 
well as their NFRAP status, is available at <a href="https://www.epa.gov/fedfacts/federal-facility-cleanup-sites-searchable-list">https://www.epa.gov/fedfacts/federal-facility-cleanup-sites-searchable-list</a> or by 
contacting the EPA HQ Docket Coordinator at the address provided in the 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this document. In prior

[[Page 54682]]

updates, information regarding NFRAP status changes was provided 
separately.

7.0 Information Contained on Docket Listing

    The information is provided in three tables. The first table is a 
list of additional Federal facilities that are being added to the 
Docket. The second table is a list of Federal facilities that are being 
deleted from the Docket. The third table is for corrections.
    The Federal facilities listed in each table are organized by the 
date reported. Under each heading is listed the name and address of the 
facility, the Federal agency responsible for the facility, the 
statutory provision(s) under which the facility was reported to EPA, 
and a code.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Each Federal facility listed in the update has been assigned 
a code that indicates a specific reason for the addition or 
deletion. The code precedes this list.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The statutory provisions under which a Federal facility is reported 
are listed in a column titled ``Reporting Mechanism.'' Applicable 
mechanisms are listed for each Federal facility: for example, sections 
3005, 3010, 3016 of RCRA, 103(c) of CERCLA, or Other. ``Other'' has 
been added as a reporting mechanism to indicate those Federal 
facilities that otherwise have been identified to have releases or 
threat of releases of hazardous substances. The National Contingency 
Plan at 40 CFR 300.405 addresses discovery or notification, outlines 
what constitutes discovery of a hazardous substance release, and states 
that a release may be discovered in several ways, including: (1) a 
report submitted in accordance with section 103(a) of CERCLA, i.e., 
reportable quantities codified at 40 CFR part 302; (2) a report 
submitted to EPA in accordance with section 103(c) of CERCLA; (3) 
investigation by government authorities conducted in accordance with 
section 104(e) of CERCLA or other statutory authority; (4) notification 
of a release by a Federal or state permit holder when required by its 
permit; (5) inventory or survey efforts or random or incidental 
observation reported by government agencies or the public; (6) 
submission of a citizen petition to EPA or the appropriate Federal 
facility requesting a preliminary assessment, in accordance with 
section 105(d) of CERCLA; (7) a report submitted in accordance with 
section 311(b)(5) of the Clean Water Act; and (8) other sources. As a 
policy matter, EPA generally believes it is appropriate for Federal 
facilities identified through the CERCLA discovery and notification 
process to be included on the Docket.
    The complete list of Federal facilities that now make up the Docket 
and the NPL and NFRAP status are available to interested parties and 
can be obtained at <a href="https://www.epa.gov/fedfacts/federal-facility-cleanup-sites-searchable-list">https://www.epa.gov/fedfacts/federal-facility-cleanup-sites-searchable-list</a> or by contacting the EPA HQ Docket 
Coordinator at the address provided in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION 
CONTACT section of this document. As of the date of this document, the 
total number of Federal facilities that appear on the Docket is 2,399.
