3501 et seq.), an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is 
not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it 
displays a valid OMB control number. The ICR documentation will be

necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, 
including whether the information will have practical utility;
    (2) Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden;
    (3) Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to

Information Collection Requirement

    Title: TSA Airspace Waiver Program.
    Type of Request: Extension of a currently approved collection.
    OMB Control Number: 1652-0033.
    Forms(s): NA.
    Affected Public: Aircraft operators, passengers, and crewmembers.
    Abstract: The airspace waiver program allows United States (U.S.) 
and foreign general aviation aircraft operators to apply for approval 
to operate manned aircraft and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in U.S.-
restricted airspace, including flying over the U.S. and its 
territories. Airspace waivers are approved by the Federal Aviation 
Administration. TSA conducts a security threat assessment for all 
pilots, crewmembers, and passengers (including armed security officers) 
who will be onboard the aircraft operated in restricted airspace, as 
well as for individuals operating UAS. To support this process, TSA 
collects certain information from the aircraft operator concerning the 
proposed flight and aircraft as well as information about these 
individuals necessary to conduct the required vetting.
    Estimated Annual Number of Respondents: 9,687.
    Estimated Annual Burden Hours: 7,173.

    Dated: November 21, 2025.
