    j. The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or 
Commission) will prepare an environmental document that will discuss 
the environmental effects of relicensing the Halifax Project. The 
Commission will use this environmental document in its decision-making 
process to determine whether to issue a new license for the project.
    k. This notice announces the opening of the scoping process the 
Commission will use to gather input from the public and interested 
agencies regarding the project. This notice is intended to advise all 
participants as to the potential scope of the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA) document and to seek additional information pertinent 
to this analysis. Commission staff does not intend to issue a separate 
scoping document.
    As part of the NEPA review process, the Commission takes into 
account

[[Page 53290]]

concerns the public may have about proposals and the environmental 
effects that could result from its action whenever it considers the 
issuance of a hydropower license. This gathering of public input is 
referred to as ``scoping.'' The main goal of the scoping process is to 
focus the analysis in the environmental document on the important 
environmental issues.
    l. Scoping Comments: By this notice, the Commission requests 
written public comments on the scope of issues to address in the 
environmental document. To ensure that your comments are timely and 
properly recorded, please submit your comments so that the Commission 
receives them in Washington, DC on or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 
December 1, 2025.
    Comments should focus on the potential environmental effects and 
reasonable alternatives. Your input will help Commission staff 
determine what issues to evaluate in the environmental document. 
Commission staff will consider all written comments during the 
preparation of the environmental document.
    The Commission strongly encourages electronic filing. Please file 
scoping comments using the Commission's eFiling system at <a href="https://ferconline.ferc.gov/FERCOnline.aspx">https://ferconline.ferc.gov/FERCOnline.aspx</a>. Commenters can submit brief 
comments up to 10,000 characters, without prior registration, using the 
eComment system at <a href="https://ferconline.ferc.gov/QuickComment.aspx">https://ferconline.ferc.gov/QuickComment.aspx</a>. You 
must include your name at the end of your comments. For assistance, 
please contact FERC Online Support at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#42040710010d2c2e2b2c27113732322d303602242730216c252d34"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ffb9baadbcb0919396919aac8a8f8f908d8bbf999a8d9cd1989089">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, (866) 
208-3676 (toll free), or (202) 502-8659 (TTY). In lieu of electronic 
filing, you may submit a paper copy. Submissions sent via the U.S. 
Postal Service must be addressed to: Debbie Anne A. Reese, Secretary, 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street NE, Room 1A, 
Washington, DC 20426. Submissions sent via any other carrier must be 
addressed to: Debbie-Anne A. Reese, Secretary, Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, 12225 Wilkins Avenue, Rockville, MD 20852. All 
filings must clearly identify the project name and docket number on the 
first page: Halifax Hydroelectric Project (P-9028-012).
    The Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure require all 
intervenors filing documents with the Commission to serve a copy of 
that document on each person on the official service list for the 
project. Further, if an intervenor files comments or documents with the 
Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the 
responsibilities of a particular resource agency, they must also serve 
a copy of the document on that resource agency.
    m. The application is not ready for environmental analysis at this 
time.
    n. Project Description: The Halifax Project consists of a 682-foot-
long, 36-foot-high dam, with a 301-foot-long concrete spillway. The dam 
creates an impoundment (Banister Lake) that has a surface area of 374-
acres at a normal surface elevation of 351.3 feet National Geodetic 
Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29). Water flows from Banister Lake to the 
project powerhouse, integral with the project dam, through trash racks 
with 2.0-inch clear bar spacing leading to three intake gates. From the 
intake gates, water flows through three vertical Francis-type turbines 
with two 455-kilowatt (kW) generating units and one 875-kW generating 
unit. Water is released from the powerhouse through draft tubes into 
the Banister River. Interconnection to the regional electric grid is 
accomplished through a 4.16/13.2-kilovolt transformer connected to a 
512-foot-long transmission line.
    Banister Hydro proposes to: (1) continue operating the project in a 
run-of-river mode and maintaining the surface elevation of the Banister 
Lake at 351.3 feet NGVD29; (2) continue to provide a year-round 
continuous minimum flow of 5 cubic feet per second for the protection 
of downstream fish and wildlife resources.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ When inflow to the project is less than 135 cfs, all flows 
are released over the project spillway except during short-term 
operational emergencies or for short periods upon mutual agreement 
between Banister Hydro and the Virginia Department of Wildlife 
Resources and the State Water Control Board.

    A copy of the application, with details of the proposed project, 
can be viewed on the Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ferc.gov">http://www.ferc.gov</a>, using 
the ``eLibrary'' link. Enter the project's docket number, excluding the 
last three digits in the docket number field, to access the document 
(P-9028). For assistance, contact FERC at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d2949780919dbcbebbbcb781a7a2a2bda0a692b4b7a0b1fcb5bda4"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ce888b9c8d81a0a2a7a0ab9dbbbebea1bcba8ea8abbcade0a9a1b8">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, 
or call toll-free, (866) 208-3676 or (202) 502-8659 (TTY).
    o. NEPA Process and the Environmental Document: Any environmental 
document issued by the Commission will discuss effects that could occur 
as a result of the project's relicensing under the relevant general 
resource areas, such as:
    <bullet> geology and soils;
    <bullet> aquatic resources;
    <bullet> terrestrial resources;
    <bullet> threatened and endangered species;
    <bullet> recreation, land use, and aesthetic resources;
    <bullet> cultural resources; and
    <bullet> developmental resources.
    Commission staff will also evaluate reasonable alternatives to the 
proposed project or portions of the project and make recommendations on 
how to lessen or avoid effects on the various resource areas. Your 
comments will help Commission staff identify and focus on the issues 
that might have an effect on the human environment and potentially 
eliminate others from further discussion in the environmental document.
    Following this scoping period, Commission staff will determine 
whether to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) or an Environmental 
Impact Statement (EIS). The EA or EIS will present Commission staff's 
independent analysis of the issues. If Commission staff prepares an EA, 
a Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Assessment will be 
issued. The EA may be issued for an allotted public comment period. The 
Commission will consider timely comments on the EA before making its 
decision regarding the proposed project. If Commission staff prepares 
an EIS, a Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement 
will be issued. Staff will then prepare a draft EIS which will be 
issued for public comment. Commission staff will consider all timely 
comments received during the comment period on the draft EIS and revise 
the document, as necessary, before issuing a final EIS. Any EA or draft 
and final EIS will be available in electronic format in the public 
record through eLibrary. If eSubscribed, you will receive instant email 
notification when the environmental document is issued (see paragraph 
(q) of this notice for instructions on using eSubscription).
    p. The Commission's Office of Public Participation (OPP) supports 
meaningful public engagement and participation in Commission 
proceedings. OPP can help members of the public, including landowners, 
community organizations, Tribal members and others, access publicly 
available information and navigate Commission processes. For public 
inquiries and assistance with making filings such as interventions, 
comments, or requests for rehearing, the public is encouraged to 
contact OPP at (202) 502-6595 or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#034c535343656671602d646c75"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="59160909193f3c2b3a773e362f">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
