SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: FERC-740, Availability of E-Tag Information to Commission 
Staff
    OMB Control No.: 1902-0254
    Type of Request: Three-year extension of the FERC-740 information 
collection requirements with no changes to the current reporting 
requirements.
    Abstract: This collection of information is authorized by 18 CFR 
366.2(d), which requires Commission access, on a non-public and view-
only basis, to information that is located on ``electronic tags,'' also 
known as ``e-Tags.'' Each e-Tag consists of an electronic record of a 
transaction to transfer energy from a generation source to a Balancing 
Authority (BA). Each BA operates a portion of the grid, balancing 
supply and demand and assuring compliance with federal reliability 
standards. E-Tag ``authors'' are typically Purchasing-Selling Entities 
(PSEs). A PSE purchases or sells energy, capacity, and Interconnected 
Operations Services.
    Transmission system operators, which are among the addressees of e-
Tags, use e-Tags to ascertain the transactions affecting their local 
systems, and to prevent damage to the power grid. Commission access to 
e-Tags helps the Commission detect and prevent market manipulation and 
anti-competitive behavior, and also monitor the efficiency of markets. 
Both transmission system operators and the Commission need the e-Tag 
information to understand the use of the interconnected electricity 
grid, particularly transactions occurring at interchanges. Due to the 
nature of the electric grid, an individual transaction's impact on an 
interchange cannot be assessed adequately in all cases without 
information from all connected systems, which is included in the e-
Tags.
    The inclusion of the Commission is completely automatic and is part 
of the normal business requirement. Thus, the time, effort, and 
financial resources necessary to comply with this collection of 
information are ``usual and customary'' within the meaning of the OMB 
regulation at 5 CFR 1320.3 (b)(2) (excluding such activities from the 
definition of ``burden''). In view of these circumstances, FERC is 
including only a ``placeholder'' burden of one hour to account for the 
rare event where a new BA qualifies for exemption under the

[[Page 52940]]

Commission's regulations (e.g., transmissions from a new non-U.S. BA 
into another non-U.S. BA using a path that does not go through a U.S. 
BA). In that case, this administrative function would be expected to 
require at most an hour of effort total from both the BA and e-Tag 
administrator to include the BA on the exemption list. New exempt BAs 
are not common--years may pass between them--but for the purpose of 
estimation, we will conservatively assume one appears each year 
creating a burden and cost associated with the Commission's FERC-740 of 
one hour and $71.27.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The total hourly cost applied in this calculation, $71.27, 
is the total hourly cost to an employer for a management analyst in 
the utilities sector. This figure includes the average hourly wage 
of $49.96 plus all employer-paid benefits, and is based on 2024 data 
from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational 
Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Type of Respondents: Purchasing-Selling Entities and Balancing 
Authorities
    Estimate of Annual Burden: \2\ The Commission estimates the burden 
and cost for FERC-740 as follows based on the distinct e-Tags submitted 
to the Commission in 2024 (the most recent full year available).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ ``Burden'' is the total time, effort, or financial resources 
expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or 
provide information to or for a Federal agency. For further 
explanation of what is included in the information collection 
burden, refer to 5 CFR part 1320.

    Comments are invited on: (1) whether the collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information will have practical 
utility; (2) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden and 
cost of the collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility and clarity of the information collection; and (4) ways to 
minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are 
to respond, including the use of automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology.

    Dated: October 15, 2025.

Secretary.
