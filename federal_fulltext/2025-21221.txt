    Information Collection Request Title: Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program 
Part F Dental Services Report, OMB No. 0915--0151--Revision.
    Abstract: The Dental Reimbursement Program (DRP) and the Community 
Based Dental Partnership Program (CBDPP) under Part F of the Ryan White 
HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) offer funding to accredited dental education 
programs to support the education and training of oral health providers 
in HIV oral health care and reimbursement for the provision of oral 
health services for people eligible for the RWHAP. Institutions 
eligible for the RWHAP DRP and CBDPP are accredited schools of 
dentistry and other accredited dental education programs, such as 
dental hygiene programs or those sponsored by a school of dentistry, a 
hospital, or a public or private institution that offers postdoctoral 
training in the specialties of dentistry, advanced education in general 
dentistry, or a dental general practice residency. The RWHAP DRP 
Application for the Notice of Funding Opportunity includes the Dental 
Services Report (DSR) that applicants use to apply for funding of non-
reimbursed costs incurred in providing oral health care to patients 
with HIV and to report annual program data. Awards are authorized under 
section 2692(b) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300ff-
111(b)). The DSR is also used by CBDPP recipients to report on services 
rendered, patients served, and partnerships as an annual requirement. 
The DSR collects data on program information, client demographics, oral 
health services, funding, and training. It also requests applicants/
recipients to provide a narrative description of the services offered, 
the types of facilities available, and their linkage and collaboration 
with community-based oral health service providers.
    Beginning with the 2022 DSR submission, the DSR website provided 
RWHAP DRP applicants and RWHAP CBDPP recipients an easily accessible 
and secure location to enter and submit their aggregate DSR data 
annually. All RWHAP DRP applicants and RWHAP CBDPP recipients will be 
authorized users of a web-based platform that allows users to easily 
navigate the site and enter their data. Users can see their report 
submission status and no longer need to email their dataset to HRSA. 
The implementation of the DSR website contributed to the overall 
decrease in burden hours. HRSA proposes minor modifications to the DSR 
data reporting tool:
    <bullet> Remove the question regarding gender to align with 
Administration priorities.
    <bullet> Add an ``Unknown'' response option for the ``Sex at 
Birth'' variable.
    <bullet> Remove ``People and Communities Disproportionately 
Impacted by HIV'' from section 4.
    Need and Proposed Use of the Information: The primary purpose of

[[Page 54333]]

collecting this information annually is to verify applicant eligibility 
and determine reimbursement amounts for DRP applicants, as well as to 
document the program accomplishments of CBDDP grant recipients. This 
information allows HRSA to learn about (1) the extent of the 
involvement of dental schools and programs in treating persons with 
HIV, (2) the number and characteristics of clients who receive RWHAP 
supported oral health services, (3) the types and frequency of the 
provision of these services, (4) the non-reimbursed costs of oral 
health care provided to persons with HIV, and (5) the scope of grant 
recipients' community-based collaborations and training of providers. 
In addition to meeting the goal of accountability to Congress, clients, 
community groups, and the public, information collected in the DSR is 
critical for HRSA and recipients to assess the status of existing HIV-
related health service delivery systems. The information will provide 
the measurement data for the HRSA budget justifications on the 
following indicators: number of persons for whom a portion/percentage 
of their unreimbursed oral health costs were reimbursed and the number 
of providers trained through the RWHAP Part F Dental Reimbursement and 
Community-Based Partnership Programs.
    Likely Respondents: Accredited schools of dentistry and other 
accredited dental education programs, such as dental hygiene programs 
or those sponsored by a school of dentistry, a hospital, or a public or 
private institution that offers postdoctoral training in the 
specialties of dentistry, advanced education in general dentistry, or a 
general dental practice residency.
    Burden Statement: Burden in this context means the time expended by 
persons to generate, maintain, retain, disclose, or provide the 
information requested. This includes the time needed to review 
instructions; to develop, acquire, install, and use technology and 
systems for the purpose of collecting, validating, and verifying 
information, processing and maintaining information, and disclosing and 
providing information; to train personnel and to be able to respond to 
a collection of information; to search data sources; to complete and 
review the collection of information; and to transmit or otherwise 
disclose the information. The total annual burden hours estimated for 
this ICR are summarized in the table below.

    HRSA specifically requests comments on (1) the necessity and 
utility of the proposed information collection for the proper 
performance of the agency's functions, (2) the accuracy of the 
estimated burden, (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity 
of the information to be collected, and (4) the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology to 
minimize the information collection burden.
