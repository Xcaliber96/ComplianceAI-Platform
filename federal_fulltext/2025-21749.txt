DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration

[Docket No. FMCSA-2025-0125]


Hours of Service of Drivers: Application for Exemption; National 
Propane Gas Association

AGENCY: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), Department 
of Transportation (DOT).

ACTION: Notice of final disposition; denial of application for 
exemption.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: FMCSA announces its decision to deny the National Propane Gas 
Association's (NPGA) application for an exemption from various hours-
of-service (HOS) requirements between December 15 and March 15 each 
year. FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined 
that the exemption would not achieve a level of safety that is 
equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent 
such exemption.

Safety Standards; 771-216-2436 or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#87f5eee4efe6f5e3a9e4ebe2eae2e9f3e2c7e3e8f3a9e0e8f1"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="17657e747f76657339747b727a727963725773786339707861">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. If you have

II. Legal Basis

    FMCSA has authority under 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b) to grant 
exemptions from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. FMCSA 
must publish a notice of each exemption request in the Federal Register 
(49 CFR 381.315(a)). The Agency must provide the public an opportunity 
to inspect the information relevant to the application, including the 
applicant's safety analysis. The Agency must provide an opportunity for 
public comment on the request.
    The Agency reviews the application, safety analyses and public 
comments submitted and determines whether granting the exemption would 
likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the 
level that would be achieved absent such exemption, pursuant to the 
standard set forth in 49 U.S.C. 31315(b)(1). The Agency must publish 
its decision in the Federal Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, 
the notice will identify the regulatory

[[Page 55334]]

provision from which the applicant will be exempt, the effective 
period, and all terms and conditions of the exemption (49 CFR 
381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption is denied, the notice will explain the 
reason for the denial (49 CFR 381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may be 
renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)).

III. Background

Current Regulatory Requirements

    Under 49 CFR 395.3(a)(2) and (3), a property-carrying commercial 
motor vehicle (CMV) driver may drive a total of 11 hours during a 
period of 14 consecutive hours after coming on duty following 10 
consecutive hours off duty. Under 49 CFR 395.3(b)(1) and (2), no motor 
carrier shall permit or require a driver of a property-carrying CMV to 
drive, nor shall any driver drive a property-carrying CMV, regardless 
of the number of motor carriers using the driver's services, for any 
period after having been on duty 60 hours in any period of 7 
consecutive days, or having been on duty 70 hours in any period of 8 
consecutive days. Additionally, under 49 CFR 395.3(c)(1) or (2), any 
period of 7 or 8 consecutive days may end with the beginning of an off-
duty period of 34 or more consecutive hours.

Applicant's Request

    NPGA's application for exemption was described in detail in a 
Federal Register notice on July 1, 2025, [90 FR 28854] and will not be 
repeated as the facts have not changed.

IV. Public Comments

    The Agency received 31 unique comments.\1\ Of the 31 comments, 22 
comments supported granting the exemption and eight opposed the 
exemption. One commenter requested an extension of the comment filing 
period, which FMCSA granted by extending the deadline until August 15, 
2025 [90 FR 35568]. Commenters that opposed the exemption included 
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, the Commercial Vehicle Safety 
Alliance (CVSA), National Tank Truck Carriers (NTTC), the Owner-
Operator Independent Driver's Association (OOIDA), the North Carolina 
Department of Environmental Quality (North Carolina), the Massachusetts 
Department of Energy Resources (Massachusetts), the Maine Governor's 
Energy Office (in coordination with the Maine Emergency Management 
Agency and the Maine Department of Public Safety) (Maine), and AWM 
Associates. Themes of opposing comments included that the exemption is 
unnecessary, that the request is overly broad, and that there is an 
existing process for waivers of HOS requirements during emergency 
declarations. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety said, ``Permitting 
an exemption for any industry or group of drivers that may face 
inclement weather during the winter months is a needless weakening of 
the HOS regulations as there is an emergency declaration process in 
place to consider such waivers when the conditions actually occur.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The regulatory docket reflect 34 comments. However, three 
comments were duplicate filings submitted by EDP, AWM Associates, 
and the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CVSA commented that the exemption is unnecessary and does not 
provide an explanation for how an equivalent level of safety will be 
maintained if implemented. OOIDA recognized NPGA's work as important 
but said, ``we do not feel overly broad relief from HOS regulations is 
warranted for these types of operations.'' Maine expressed concern that 
the exemption would ``usurp [ ] local control over actions to address 
local energy emergencies. . . .'' North Carolina noted that liquid 
fuels are hazardous and explosive and commented that the State has seen 
significant crashes involving liquid fuels. Massachusetts stated 
concern with giving NPGA members ``carte blanche'' authority for three 
months every year, the lack of data to support the need for the 
exemption, and the risks to public safety.
    NTTC stated that its members are ``unwilling to accept the legal 
and insurance risks'' of using an HOS exemption and that ``NTTC opposes 
blanket exemptions of certain fuel commodities over others.'' NTTC 
concluded that granting HOS exemptions ``potentially undermines our 
industry's work and message of prioritizing highway safety.''
    Propane transporters submitted comments supporting the exemption. 
Jeff Mortenson said, ``Deliveries often surge due to increased demand 
and unpredictable weather conditions.'' Patrick Temples added, ``As a 
propane marketer serving rural and weather-dependent communities, 
flexibility in hours of service is critical. This waiver, which we 
support, would help us better plan deliveries during peak demand 
periods, especially in extreme cold, and avoid disruptions that put 
customer safety at risk.'' C Three Logistics LLC said, ``Due to the 
crossing of state lines in most cases the single state waivers are not 
useful and do not give the drivers the ability to deliver needed 
heating fuel.''

V. FMCSA Decision

    FMCSA has evaluated NPGA's application and the public comments and 
denies the exemption. As noted by commenters, the Agency has an 
existing process to issue emergency declarations and HOS waivers in 
response to, and even in advance of, severe weather scenarios and other 
emergencies.
    On April 19, 2023, the Agency denied a similar exemption request 
from NPGA, finding that NPGA failed to provide both an analysis of the 
safety impacts of the requested exemption and countermeasures to ensure 
that the exemption would achieve the requisite level of safety [88 FR 
24259]. The current application also did not provide an analysis of the 
safety impacts of the requested exemption. The only safety 
countermeasures NPGA describes are an online Fatigue and Wellness 
Awareness Course and a statement that drivers would abide by all other 
Federal regulations when not responding to an emergency. Given the 
hazardous nature of the material being transported and breadth of the 
exemption requested, FMCSA cannot determine that the exemption would 
likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater 
than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
    For the above reasons, NPGA's exemption application is denied.
