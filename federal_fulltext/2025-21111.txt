    Type of Request: Revision of a currently approved collection.
    OMB Control Number: 1652-0044.
    Forms(s): Traveler Inquiry and Survey Forms.
    Affected Public: Traveling Public.
    Abstract: DHS TRIP is a single point of contact for individuals who 
have inquiries or seek resolution regarding difficulties they have 
experienced during their travel screening. TSA manages the DHS TRIP 
office on behalf of DHS. The collection of information includes: (1) a 
Traveler Inquiry Form, which includes the individual's identifying and 
travel experience information; and (2) two optional, anonymous customer 
satisfaction surveys to allow the public to provide DHS feedback on its 
experience using DHS TRIP.
    TSA is revising the collection to comply with a Government 
Accountability Office recommendation to update the surveys to include 
opportunities for suggestions and feedback on the application 
process.\1\ The revisions add additional questions and provide open 
text for respondents to offer suggestions and feedback on the 
application and the redress processes. TSA also has made non-
substantive changes to the application, correcting a typo and changing 
the phrase ``Name of Entry into the U.S.'' to ``Name at Entry into the 
U.S.''
