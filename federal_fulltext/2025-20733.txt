SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) finds that Kumho 
P&B Chemicals, Inc. (KPB), a producer/exporter subject to this 
administrative review, did not make sales of acetone from the Republic 
of Korea (Korea) at less than normal value. The period of review (POR) 
is March 1, 2023, through February 29, 2024.

DATES: Applicable November 24, 2025.

DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482-1398.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    On July 11, 2025, Commerce published the Preliminary Results in the

[[Page 52915]]

Federal Register and invited comments from interested parties.\1\ On 
August 1, 2025, KPB timely submitted a case brief.\2\ No other party 
filed a case or rebuttal brief.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See Acetone from the Republic of Korea: Preliminary Results 
and Rescission, in Part, of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; 
2023-2024, 90 FR 30847 (July 11, 2025) (Preliminary Results), and 
accompanying Preliminary Decision Memorandum.
    \2\ See KPB's Letter, ``Case Brief of Kumho P&B Chemicals, 
Inc.,'' dated August 1, 2025).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For a complete description of the events that have occurred since 
Commerce published the Preliminary Results, as well as a full 
discussion of the issues raised by parties for these final results, see 
the Issues and Decision Memorandum.\3\ Commerce conducted this review 
in accordance with section 751(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended 
(the Act).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Memorandum, ``Issues and Decision Memorandum for the 
Final Results of the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review of 
Acetone from the Republic of Korea; 2023-2024,'' dated concurrently 
with, and hereby adopted by, this notice (Issues and Decision 
Memorandum).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Due to the lapse in appropriations and Federal Government shutdown, 
on November 14, 2025, Commerce tolled all deadlines in administrative 
proceedings by 47 days.\4\ Accordingly, the deadline for these final 
results is now December 26, 2025.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Memorandum, ``Deadlines Affected by the Shutdown of the 
Federal Government,'' dated November 14, 2025.
    \5\ Because the tolled deadline for these final results falls on 
the Christmas holiday (i.e., December 25, 2025), the deadline became 
the next business day (i.e., December 26, 2025). See Notice of 
Clarification: Application of ``Next Business Day'' Rule for 
Administrative Determination Deadlines Pursuant to the Tariff Act of 
1930, As Amended, 70 FR 24533 (May 10, 2005).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes Since the Preliminary Results

    Based on a review of the record and comments received from KPB 
regarding the Preliminary Results, we made certain changes to the 
preliminary weighted-average dumping margin calculated for KPB. For a 
detailed discussion of these changes, see the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum.

Final Results of Review

    We determine the following weighted-average dumping margin exists 
for the period March 1, 2023, through February 29, 2024:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Weighted-
                                                                average
                      Exporter/producer                         dumping
                                                                margin
                                                               (percent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kumho P&B Chemicals, Inc....................................        0.00
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disclosure

    Commerce intends to disclose the calculations performed in 
connection with these final results of review to interested parties 
within five days after public announcement of the final results or, if 
there is no public announcement, within five days of the date of 
publication of the notice of final results in the Federal Register, in 
accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b).

Assessment Rates

    Pursuant to section 751(a)(2)(C) of the Act, and 19 CFR 
351.212(b)(1), Commerce has determined, and U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate 
entries of subject merchandise in accordance with the final results of 
this review. Where the respondent's weighted-average dumping margin is 
zero or de minimis within the meaning of 19 CFR 351.106(c)(1), then 
Commerce will instruct CBP to liquidate entries without regard to 
antidumping duties.\7\ Accordingly, because the final weighted-average 
dumping margin for KPB is zero percent, we will instruct CBP to 
liquidate the appropriate entries without regard to antidumping duties.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See Antidumping Proceedings: Calculation of the Weighted-
Average Dumping Margin and Assessment Rate in Certain Antidumping 
Proceedings: Final Modification, 77 FR 8101, 8103 (February 14, 
2012).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For entries of subject merchandise during the POR produced by KPB 
for which it did not know that the merchandise it sold to the 
intermediary (e.g., reseller, trading company, or exporter) was 
destined for the United States, we will instruct CBP to liquidate such 
entries at the all-others rate (i.e., 33.10 percent) \8\ if there is no 
rate for the intermediate company(ies) involved in the transaction.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See Order, 85 FR at 17866.
    \9\ For a full discussion of this practice, see Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Proceedings: Assessment of Antidumping Duties, 
68 FR 23954 (May 6, 2003).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Commerce intends to issue liquidation instructions to CBP no 
earlier than 35 days after the date of publication of the final results 
of this review in the Federal Register. If a timely summons is filed at 
the U.S. Court of International Trade, the assessment instructions will 
direct CBP not to liquidate relevant entries until the time for parties 
to file a request for a statutory injunction has expired (i.e., within 
90 days of publication).

Cash Deposit Requirements

    The following deposit requirements will be effective for all 
shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the 
final results of this administrative review, as provided by section 
751(a)(2)(C) of the Act: (1) the cash deposit rate for KPB listed above 
will be equal to the weighted-average dumping margin established in the 
final results of this administrative review, except if the rate is less 
than 0.50 percent and, therefore, de minimis within the meaning of 19 
CFR 351.106(c)(1), in which case the cash deposit rates will be zero; 
(2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not participating 
in this review, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-
specific rate published for the most recently completed segment of this 
proceeding in which the producer or exporter participated; (3) if the 
exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the 
original investigation but the producer is, the cash deposit rate will 
be the rate established for the most recently completed segment of this 
proceeding for the producer of the subject merchandise; and (4) the 
cash deposit rate for all other producers or exporters will continue to 
be the all-others rate established in the less-than-fair-value 
investigation (i.e., 33.10

[[Page 52916]]

percent).\10\ These cash deposit requirements, when imposed, shall 
remain in effect until further notice.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See Order, 85 FR at 17866.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Administrative Protective Order (APO)

    This notice serves as the only reminder to parties subject to an 
APO of their responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary 
information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 
351.305(a)(3), which continues to govern business proprietary 
information in this segment of the proceeding. Timely written 
notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to 
judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with 
the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation.

Notification to Importers

    This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their 
responsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a certificate 
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation 
of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply 
with this requirement could result in Commerce's presumption that 
reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent 
assessment of doubled antidumping duties.

Notification to Interested Parties

    We are issuing and publishing these final results in accordance 
with sections 751(a)(1) and 777(i)(1) of the Act, and 19 CFR 
351.221(b)(5).

    Dated: November 19, 2025.

Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy and Negotiations, performing the 
non-exclusive functions and duties of the Assistant Secretary for 
Enforcement and Compliance.
