INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION

[Investigation Nos. 701-TA-733-736 and 731-TA-1702-1711 (Final)]


Corrosion-Resistant Steel Products From Australia, Brazil, 
Canada, Mexico, Netherlands, South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, United Arab 
Emirates, and Vietnam; Determinations

    On the basis of the record \1\ developed in the subject 
investigations, the United States International Trade Commission 
(``Commission'') determines, pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the 
Act''), that an industry in the United States is materially injured by 
reason of imports of corrosion-resistant steel products from Australia, 
Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Netherlands, South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, 
United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, provided for in subheadings 
7210.30.00, 7210.41.00, 7210.49.00, 7210.61.00, 7210.69.00, 7210.70.60, 
7210.90.10, 7210.90.60, 7210.90.90, 7212.20.00, 7212.30.10, 7212.30.30, 
7212.30.50, 7212.40.10, 7212.40.50, 7212.50.00, 7212.60.00, 7215.90.10, 
7215.90.30, 7215.90.50, 7217.20.15, 7217.30.15, 7217.90.10, 7217.90.50, 
7225.91.00, 7225.92.00, 7225.99.00, 7226.99.01, 7228.60.60, 7228.60.80, 
and 7229.90.10 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, 
that have been found by the U.S. Department of Commerce (``Commerce'') 
to be sold in the United States at less than fair value (``LTFV'') and 
found to be subsidized by the governments of Brazil, Canada, Mexico, 
and Vietnam.<SUP>2 3</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The record is defined in Sec.  207.2(f) of the Commission's 
Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 207.2(f)).
    \2\ 90 FR 42187, 42189, 42194, 42198, 42200, 42204, 42207, 
42210, 42213, 42216, 42219, 42223, 42226, and 42229 (August 29, 
2025).
    \3\ The Commission also finds that imports subject to Commerce's 
affirmative critical circumstances determination on South Africa are 
not likely to undermine seriously the remedial effect of the 
antidumping duty order on corrosion-resistant steel products from 
South Africa.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background

    The Commission instituted these investigations effective September 
5, 2024, following receipt of petitions filed with the Commission and 
Commerce by Steel Dynamics, Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana; Nucor 
Corporation, Charlotte, North Carolina; United States Steel 
Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Wheeling-Nippon Steel, Inc., 
Follansbee, West Virginia; and the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, 
Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers 
International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC, Washington, DC. The final phase of 
the investigations was scheduled by the Commission following 
notification of preliminary determinations by Commerce that imports of 
corrosion-resistant steel products from Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and 
Vietnam were subsidized within the meaning of section 703(b) of the Act 
(19 U.S.C. 1671b(b)) and that imports of corrosion-resistant steel 
products from Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Netherlands, South 
Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam were sold at 
LTFV within the meaning of 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). 
Notice of the scheduling of the final phase of the Commission's 
investigations and of a public hearing to be held in connection 
therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of 
the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and 
by publishing the notice in the Federal Register on May 8, 2025 (90 FR 
19529).\4\ The Commission conducted its hearing on August 12, 2025. All 
persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to participate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Due to the lapse in appropriations and ensuing cessation of 
government operations, all import injury investigations conducted 
under authority of Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 have been 
tolled pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1671d(b)(2) and 1673d(b)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission made these determinations pursuant to Sec. Sec.  
705(b) and 735(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1671d(b) and 19 U.S.C. 
1673d(b)). It completed and filed its determinations in these 
investigations on November 28, 2025. The views of the Commission are 
contained in USITC Publication 5678 (November 2025), entitled 
Corrosion-Resistant Steel Products from Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Mexico, Netherlands, South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, United Arab 
Emirates, and Vietnam: Investigation Nos. 701-TA-733-736 and 731-TA-
1702-1711 (Final).

    By order of the Commission.
    Issued: November 28, 2025.
