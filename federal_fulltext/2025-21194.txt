    Abstract: The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 established 
Federal Student Aid (FSA) as the first Performance-Based Organization 
(PBO). One purpose of the PBO is to improve service to students and 
other participants in the student financial assistance programs 
authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as 
amended, including making those programs more understandable to 
students and their parents. To do that, FSA has committed to ensuring 
that all people receive service that matches or exceeds the best 
service available in the private sector. Requirements of the 
legislation establish an on-going need for FSA to be engaged in an 
interactive process of collecting information and using it to improve 
program services and processes. The use of customer surveys and focus 
groups allows FSA to gather that information from the affected parties 
in a timely manner to improve communications with our product users.

Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development.
