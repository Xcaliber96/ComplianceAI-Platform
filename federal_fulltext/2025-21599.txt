Notice of Availability; Crossroads-Hobbs-Roadrunner Transmission 
Project Habitat Conservation Plan and Draft Environmental Assessment; 
Roosevelt and Lea Counties, New Mexico

AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

ACTION: Notice of availability; request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, received an 
application from Nextera Energy Transmission Southwest, LLC for an 
incidental take permit (permit) supported by the Crossroads-Hobbs-
Roadrunner Transmission Project: Dunes Sagebrush Lizard Habitat 
Conservation Plan (CTHCP) in Roosevelt and Lea counties, New Mexico. 
The CTHCP includes a proposed plan to build 137 miles of 345-kV 
transmission line in Roosevelt and Lea Counties. With this notice, we 
announce the availability for public comment of the proposed CTHCP and 
the draft environmental assessment (draft EA). If approved, the 
requested permit would authorize incidental take of the dunes sagebrush 
lizard. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, 
and local governments.

2025.

ADDRESSES: 
    Obtaining Documents: The documents this notice announces, as well

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
(Service), make available for public comment the application submitted 
by Nextera Energy Transmission Southwest, LLC (NEET SW; applicant) for 
an incidental take permit (permit) under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the 
Endangered Species Act (ESA; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). The application 
is supported by the proposed Crossroads-Hobbs-Roadrunner Transmission 
Project: Dunes Sagebrush Lizard Habitat Conservation Plan (CTHCP) and 
the associated draft EA. The CTHCP addresses the effects of installing 
a 137-mile (mi) 345-kilovolt (kV) transmission line and associated 
access roads in Roosevelt and Lea Counties, New Mexico, on the dunes 
sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus arenicolus; DSL).
    If approved, the proposed CTHCP would offset impacts to 277 acres 
(ac) of DSL habitat through the establishment of conservation easements 
on up to 6,000 ac of private land. In addition, the CTHCP would also 
establish Land Use Restriction or Condition (LURCs) on up to 20,000 ac 
of New Mexico State Land Office lands to improve habitat connectivity 
for the DSL for 35 years. The conservation easements will be finalized 
within 18 months of the start of construction in DSL habitat.
    Authorized incidental take of the DSL would result from 
construction, operation, and maintenance of the transmission line and 
associated access roads along with loss of the shinnery oak sand dune 
habitat on which the DSL depends.
    The associated draft EA has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA; 42 U.S.C. 
4321 et seq.). The draft EA evaluates the impacts of, and alternatives 
to, issuing the permit for the Crossroads-Hobbs-Roadrunner transmission 
line project.

Background

    Section 9 of the ESA and our implementing regulations at 50 CFR 
part 17 prohibit the ``take'' of fish or wildlife species listed as 
endangered or threatened. Take is defined under the ESA as to ``harass, 
harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect 
listed animal species, or to attempt to engage in such conduct'' (16 
U.S.C. 1538). However, under section 10(a) of the ESA, we may issue 
permits to authorize incidental take of listed species. ``Incidental 
take'' is defined by the ESA as take that is incidental to, and not the 
purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity. Regulations 
governing such take of endangered and threatened species are found at 
50 CFR 17.21-22 and 50 CFR 17.31-32, respectively.

Proposed Action

    The proposed action is the issuance of an incidental take permit 
(permit) under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA supported by proposed 
Crossroads-Hobbs-Roadrunner Transmission Project: Dunes Sagebrush 
Lizard Habitat Conservation Plan (CTHCP). The permit duration would be 
60 years, expiring in 2085, at which time NEET SW plans to either renew 
the permit or decommission the transmission line.
    The proposed project includes the construction, operation, and 
maintenance of a new 137-mi 345-kV transmission line and associated 
facilities. The proposed line would connect the Crossroads, Hobbs, and 
Roadrunner substations in Lea and Roosevelt counties, New Mexico. The 
proposed project includes a 150-foot right-of-way consisting of 
approximately 2,506 ac, 141 ac of temporary laydown yards, 359 ac of 
access roads, and 926 transmission poles.
    The CTHCP's covered activities are limited to actions within the 
permit area that are reasonably certain to take DSL. The covered 
activities will result in impacts to 277 ac of DSL habitat and include: 
construction and installation of 94 transmission poles and associated 
maintenance areas, line splicing areas, tensioning and pulling sites, 
hazard tree removal, emergency response, approximately 16 mi of access 
roads, general operations and maintenance activities, vegetation 
maintenance, decommissioning, and repower/recommissioning.
    Impacts and take resulting from the covered activities will be 
minimized and mitigated to the maximum extent practicable through the 
implementation of minimization measures, as described in section 6 of 
the CTHCP, and the placing of up to approximately 6,000 ac of private 
land in conservation easements (of which approximately 3,678 ac fall 
within suitable DSL habitat). The location of the conservation 
easements will be determined based on further negotiations. In 
addition, although not considered mitigation for impacts to DSL, NEET 
SW has a goal of conserving 20,000 ac of New Mexico State Land Office 
lands under Land Use Restriction or Condition (LURCs). The total 
acreage and location of LURCs is subject to negotiation.
    The conservation goal for both the conservation easement lands and 
lands covered by LURCs would be to connect existing conservation lands 
east of Highway 206 to existing conservation lands west of Highway 206 
to create a large contiguous landscape protected from further large-
scale development and prevent future DSL habitat loss and 
fragmentation.

Alternatives

    We are considering one alternative to the proposed action as part 
of this process, the no action alternative. Under the no action 
alternative, the Service would not approve the proposed CTHCP and would 
not issue the permit. Under this alternative, as stated in section 8.2 
of the CTHCP, the transmission line would not be built.

Next Steps

    We will evaluate the permit application, draft EA, and comments we 
receive to determine whether the application meets the requirements of 
the ESA, NEPA, and their implementing regulations. If we determine that 
all requirements are met, we will approve the CTHCP and issue the 
permit under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA to the applicant. Our 
approval will be in accordance with the terms of the CTHCP and specific 
terms and conditions of the authorizing permit. We will not make our 
final decision until after the 30-day comment period ends and we have 
fully considered all comments received during the public comment 
period.
