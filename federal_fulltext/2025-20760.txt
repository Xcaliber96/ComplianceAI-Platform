[Docket No. BOEM-2025-0483]


Notice of Availability of the 11th National Outer Continental 
Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Draft Proposed Program: 1st Analysis and 
Proposal MAA104000

AGENCY: Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Interior.

ACTION: Notice of Availability; request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is announcing the 
availability of, and requests comments on, the Draft Proposed Program 
(DPP) for the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas 
Leasing Program (11th Program or National OCS Program).

DATES: Comments should be submitted by January 23, 2026 to the address 
specified in the ADDRESSES section of this notice.

ADDRESSES: Comments on the DPP may be submitted in one of the following 
ways:
    1. Through the <a href="http://Regulations.gov">Regulations.gov</a> web portal (preferred method): 
Navigate to <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">http://www.regulations.gov</a> and under the Search tab, in the 
space provided, type in Docket ID: BOEM-2025-0483 to submit comments 
and to view other comments already submitted.
    2. Mailed in an envelope labeled ``Comments for the 11th National 
OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program'' and mailed (or hand delivered) to Ms. 
Kelly Hammerle, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (VAM-LD), 45600 
Woodland Road, Sterling, VA 20166-9216, telephone (703) 342-8867.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Kelly Hammerle, Program Manager, 
(703) 342-8867.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The OCS Lands Act declares that it is the 
policy of the United States that the OCS ``is a vital national resource 
reserve held by the Federal Government for the public, which should be 
made available for expeditious and orderly development, subject to 
environmental safeguards, in a manner which is consistent with the 
maintenance of competition and other national needs.'' (43 U.S.C. 
1332). BOEM requests information and comments from Tribal, state, and 
local governments; Native American and Native Alaskan organizations; 
Federal agencies; environmental and other public interest 
organizations; the oil and gas industry; non-energy industries; other 
interested organizations and entities; and the public for use in the 
preparation of the 11th National OCS Program. BOEM is seeking a wide 
array of information, including but not limited to information 
associated with the economic, social, and environmental values of all 
OCS resources, as well as the potential impact of oil and gas 
exploration and development on OCS resources and the marine, coastal, 
and human environments.
    During this comment period, BOEM is soliciting nominations for 
environmentally sensitive areas that may be considered for exclusion 
from leasing. These may be analyzed in the environmental analysis 
document at the National OCS Program stage but may also be reviewed and 
considered at subsequent stages in the process. Ideally, nominations 
for areas to exclude from leasing would be discrete geographic areas 
that are smaller than a planning area (e.g., areas of sensitive bottom 
habitat in the Gulf of America (GOA)).

Public Comment Procedure

    BOEM will accept comments via the internet commenting system 
regulations.gov, or by regular U.S. mail. Comments submitted by other 
means may not be considered. BOEM's strong preference is to receive 
comments via regulations.gov, except when a comment contains 
proprietary information. Comments should include full names and 
addresses of the individual submitting the comment(s). Before including 
personal identifying information in your comment, be aware that your 
entire comment--including your personal identifying information--may be 
made publicly available. While you can ask BOEM in your comment to 
withhold your personal identifying information from public review, BOEM 
cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so. Even if BOEM withholds 
your information in the context of this notice, your submission is 
subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and if your 
submission is requested under the FOIA, your information will only be 
withheld if a determination is made that one of the FOIA's exemptions 
to disclosure applies. Such a determination will be made in accordance 
with the Department's FOIA regulations and applicable law.

Background Information

    The development of a new National OCS Program is a key component of 
the U.S. Department of the Interior's implementation of President 
Donald Trump's Executive Order (E.O.) 14154, ``Unleashing American 
Energy'' (January 20, 2025), and Secretary Burgum's Secretary's Order 
3418, ``Unleashing American Energy'' (February 3, 2025). The E.O. 
states that it is ``in the national interest to unleash America's 
affordable and reliable energy and natural resources'' and that it ``is 
the policy of the United States . . . to encourage energy exploration 
and production on Federal lands and waters, including on the [OCS], in 
order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States 
as a global energy leader long into the future.''
    As directed by the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), BOEM 
initiated the development of the 11th Program by issuing a Request for 
Information and Comments (RFI) on April 30, 2025 (90 FR 17972). The 
National OCS Program development process is consistent with Section 18 
of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCS Lands Act), 43 U.S.C. 
1344, and its implementing regulations, and includes the development of 
a DPP, a Proposed Program, a Proposed Final Program (PFP), and 
Secretarial approval of the 11th Program.
    This Notice of Availability (NOA) announces the availability of the 
DPP

[[Page 52997]]

for public review and comment. The DPP includes an analysis of all 27 
OCS Planning Areas under Section 18, called the 1st Analysis, and the 
Secretary's 1st Proposal of lease sales on the OCS for the 11th 
Program. This 1st Proposal provides the basis for gathering information 
and conducting analyses to inform the Secretary on which areas to 
include in the 2nd Proposal for further leasing consideration in the 
11th Program.
    The 1st Proposal for the 11th Program would make more than 85 
percent of the estimated technically recoverable OCS oil and gas 
resources available for leasing during the five-year period following 
program approval. The 1st Proposal considers three of the four OCS 
Regions for leasing, including the program areas that are estimated to 
have some of the most prospective oil and gas resources and potential 
to provide beneficial effects for the U.S. economy and national 
security from reduced oil imports and stable energy sources.
    The 1st Proposal will enable the Secretary to receive information 
necessary to conduct a thorough consideration of the section 18(a)(2) 
factors and to perform the balancing analysis required by Section 
18(a)(3) of the OCS Lands Act necessary to select the timing and 
location of future leasing. Including areas in the 11th Program at this 
stage incentivizes industry to look to the U.S. OCS when considering 
long-term investment strategies in upstream energy development and 
encourages industry to employ their worldclass geological and technical 
expertise to assess and evaluate America's potential OCS oil and gas 
resources. This will, in turn, further America's understanding of the 
resources available on the OCS to meet national energy needs. The 
Secretary's approach to the 1st Proposal does not prematurely foreclose 
exploration planning, but fosters it, to allow for the potential 
discovery of oil and gas on the OCS.
    Allowing for the potential discovery of new oil and gas reserves on 
the OCS is consistent with the Administration's policies, which seek to 
achieve energy security and resilience by reducing U.S. reliance on 
imported energy. Additionally, OCS oil and gas production benefits the 
United States by helping to reinvigorate American manufacturing and job 
growth and contributes to the U.S. gross domestic product. Many of the 
jobs in the oil and gas industry earn a significant wage premium; these 
employees have more purchasing power and can consume more goods and 
services, which increases their standard of living and contributes more 
to the economy.
    Grounded in the above principles, and after careful consideration 
of public input and the OCS Lands Act Section 18(a)(2) factors, the 1st 
Proposal includes a schedule of 34 lease sales in three of the four OCS 
Regions, including all or portions of 21 of the 27 OCS planning areas 
(see Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2). This 1st Proposal does not include a 
potential lease sale in the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area, 
Washington/Oregon Planning Area, or any of the Atlantic planning areas. 
After considering relevant information and analysis, the Secretary 
intends to create a new South-Central GOA Planning Area, the boundaries 
of which would align with GOA Program Area B. Additionally, the 
Secretary has decided to remove the remaining areas within the current 
Eastern GOA Planning Area from further leasing consideration in the 
11th Program (see Figure 2).
