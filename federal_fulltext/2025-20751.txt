14 CFR Part 39

[Docket No. FAA-2025-5030; Project Identifier MCAI-2025-00322-R]
RIN 2120-AA64


Airworthiness Directives; Bell Textron Canada Limited Helicopters

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) 
for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 429 helicopters. This 
proposed AD was prompted by reports of incorrectly installed lockwire 
on the stability and control augmentation system (SCAS) actuator jam 
nut. This proposed AD would require inspecting the installation of the 
lockwire on the SCAS actuator jam nut and, if the lockwire is 
incorrectly installed, removing the lockwire and installing a new 
lockwire correctly. This proposed AD would also prohibit the 
installation of an affected SCAS actuator assembly unless certain 
requirements are met. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the 
unsafe condition on these products.

DATES: The FAA must receive comments on this NPRM by January 8, 2026.

and actually treated as private by its owner. Under the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), CBI is exempt from public 
disclosure. If your comments responsive to this NPRM contain commercial 
or financial information that is customarily treated as private, that 
you actually treat as private, and that is relevant or responsive to 
this NPRM, it is important that you clearly designate the submitted 
comments as CBI. Please mark each page of your submission containing 
CBI as ``PROPIN.'' The FAA will treat such marked submissions as 
confidential under the FOIA, and they will not be placed in the public 
docket of this NPRM. Submissions containing CBI should be sent to Kim-
Anh Tran, Aviation Safety Engineer, FAA, 1600 Stewart Avenue, Suite 
410, Westbury, NY 11590. Any commentary that the FAA receives which is

Background

    Transport Canada, which is the aviation authority for Canada, has 
issued Transport Canada AD CF-2025-16, dated March 17, 2025 (Transport 
Canada AD CF-2025-16) (also referred to as the MCAI), to correct an 
unsafe condition on Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 429 helicopters, 
serial numbers 57001 and subsequent, with SCAS actuator part numbers 
(P/N) 429-001-065-107, 429-001-065-109, or 429-001-065-111 installed. 
The MCAI states that there have been several reports of incorrectly 
installed lockwire on the SCAS actuator jam nut. The MCAI further 
states that the incorrect installation of the lockwire could allow the 
actuator jam nut to loosen. This condition, if not addressed, could 
lead to the SCAS actuator rotating on the axis of the tube, interfering 
with the adjacent structure and limiting or completely jamming control 
movement, resulting in partial or complete loss of control of the 
helicopter.
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2025-5030.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed Transport Canada AD CF-2025-16, dated March 17, 
2025, which specifies procedures for a one-time inspection of the 
lockwire installation of the jam nuts of the cyclic longitudinal, 
cyclic lateral, and directional SCAS actuators and, if the lockwire is 
improperly installed, removal of the lockwire and installation of a new 
lockwire in the correct direction. Transport Canada AD CF-2025-16 also 
prohibits the installation of an affected SCAS actuator assembly unless 
certain requirements are met. This material is reasonably available 
because the interested parties have access to it through their normal 
course

of business or by the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

FAA's Determination

    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority 
(CAA) of another country and are approved for operation in the United 
States. Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of 
Design Authority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe 
condition described in the MCAI and material referenced above. The FAA 
is issuing this NPRM after determining that the unsafe condition 
described previously is likely to exist or develop on other products of 
the same type design.

Proposed AD Requirements in This NPRM

    This proposed AD would require accomplishing the actions specified 
in the material already described.

Explanation of Required Compliance Information

    In the FAA's ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of the AD 
process, the FAA developed a process to use some CAA ADs as the primary 
source of information for compliance with requirements for 
corresponding FAA ADs. The FAA has been coordinating this process with 
manufacturers and CAAs. As a result, the FAA proposes to incorporate 
Transport Canada AD CF-2025-16 by reference in the FAA final rule. This 
proposed AD would, therefore, require compliance with Transport Canada 
AD CF-2025-16 in its entirety through that incorporation, except for 
any differences identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of this 
proposed AD. Material required by Transport Canada AD CF-2025-16 for 
compliance will be available at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under Docket No. FAA-
2025-5030 after the FAA final rule is published.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD, if adopted as proposed, would 
affect 101 helicopters of U.S. registry.
    The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this proposed 
AD:

                                                 Estimated Costs

                                            hour = $128.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FAA estimates the following costs to do any necessary repairs 
that would be required based on the results of the proposed inspection. 
The agency has no way of determining the number of helicopters that 
might need this repair:

                                               On-Condition Costs

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship 
between the national government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed 
regulation:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
