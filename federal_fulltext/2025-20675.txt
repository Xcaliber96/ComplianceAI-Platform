-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)

discharge exhaust forward of the cab when operating on public roads. 
FMCSA requests public comment on Atlantic's application.

II. Legal Basis

    FMCSA has authority under 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b) to grant 
exemptions from Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). 
FMCSA must publish a notice of each exemption request in the Federal 
Register (49 CFR 381.315(a)). The Agency must provide the public an 
opportunity to inspect the information relevant to the application, 
including any safety analyses that have been conducted. The Agency must 
provide an opportunity for public comment on the request.
    The Agency reviews the application, safety analyses, and public 
comments submitted and determines whether granting the exemption would 
likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the 
level that would be achieved by the current regulation (49 CFR 
381.305). The Agency must publish its decision in the Federal Register 
(49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, the notice will identify the 
regulatory provision from which the applicant will be exempt, the 
effective period, and all terms and conditions of the exemption (49 CFR 
381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption is denied, the notice will explain the 
reason for the denial (49 CFR 381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may be 
renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)).

III. Applicant's Request

Current Regulatory Requirements

    Section 393.83(e) of the FMCSRs requires the exhaust system of a 
bus, truck, or truck tractor to discharge to the atmosphere at or near 
the rear of the cab (i.e., not forward of the cab).

Applicant's Request

    Atlantic Aviation Orlando, LLC requests an exemption from 49 CFR 
393.83(e) to allow four jet-fuel refueler straight trucks (units JT-01, 
JT-03, JT-04, and JT-07) to continue operating with exhaust outlets 
located forward of the cab, as designed, while conducting escorted 
movements within Orlando International Airport, traveling approximately 
a one-mile round trip between Atlantic's facilities at 9245 Tradeport 
Drive and the Airport Fuel facilities at 3800 Express Street. Atlantic 
states the vehicles' exhaust outlets were installed below the front 
bumper to comply with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 
407 Section 6.1.13.4, which prohibits discharging exhaust where it 
could ignite fuel vapors present during normal operations or released 
by accidental spillage or leakage. Atlantic asserts that discharging 
exhaust rearward, where fuel vapors may be present, poses a safety risk 
that could create ignition hazards or risk aircraft damage.
    To support an equivalent level of safety, Atlantic provided results 
of in-cab carbon monoxide (CO) testing on three of their jet-fuel 
refulers trucks JT-01, JT-03 and JT-07, showing 0 parts per million 
(ppm) CO under idle and top-speed conditions, corresponding to an 8-
hour time-weighted average of 0 ppm which is below the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limit 
(PEL) of 50 ppm.
    A copy of Atlantic's application for exemption, and all supporting 
materials, are available for review in the docket for this notice.

IV. Request for Comments

    In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31315(b), FMCSA requests public 
comment from all interested persons on Atlantic's application for a 
five-year exemption from 49 CFR 393.95(f), 392.22(a), and 392.22(b) 
(f).
    All comments received before the close of business on the comment 
closing date will be considered and will be available for examination 
in the docket at the location listed under the Addresses section of 
this notice. Comments received after the comment closing date will be 
filed in the public docket and may be considered to the

[[Page 53048]]

extent practicable. In addition to late comments, FMCSA will also 
continue to file, in the public docket, relevant information that 
becomes available after the comment closing date. Interested persons 
should continue to examine the public docket for new material.

Associate Administrator for Policy.
