DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

[Project No. 2212-059]


Domtar Paper Company, LLC; Notice of Revised Schedule for 
Environmental Assessment

    On August 27, 2024, and supplemented on February 28, 2025, March 
14, 2025, September 30, 2025, and November 7, 2025, Domtar Paper 
Company, LLC (licensee) filed an application for a non-capacity 
amendment for the Rothschild Hydroelectric Project No. 2212. The 
project is located on the Wisconsin River in Marathon County, 
Wisconsin. The project does not occupy any federal lands.
    The licensee requests a non-capacity amendment of its license to 
replace the existing timber crib spillway section with two 
hydraulically actuated overhead hinged crest gates mounted on a 
reinforced concrete crest structure with reinforced concrete piers. 
Additionally, a reinforced concrete labyrinth crest structure and 
reinforced concrete stilling basins would be constructed for both 
spillways. The new spillway is expected to have similar hydraulic 
capacity to the timber crib spillway. The licensee does not intend to 
draw down the reservoir during construction, which is expected to take 
approximately three and a half years to complete.
    On June 26, 2025, the Commission issued a Notice of Intent that 
informed the public that Commission staff plans to issue an 
Environmental Assessment (EA) \1\ by February 23, 2026. Commission 
staff is revising the schedule to issue an EA by December 12, 2025. The 
EA will be issued for a 30-day comment period. Revisions to the 
schedule may be made as appropriate. All comments filed on the EA will 
be reviewed by staff and considered in the Commission's final decision 
on the proceeding.

    \1\ The unique identification number for documents relating to 
this environmental review is EAXX-019-20-000-1750232650.
