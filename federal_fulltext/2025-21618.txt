Communications Commission Delegated Authority

AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission.

ACTION: Notice and request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork burdens, 
and as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) invites the 
general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to 
comment on the following information collections. Comments are 
requested concerning: whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information shall have practical 
utility; the accuracy of the Commission's burden estimate; ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on the 
respondents, including the use of automated collectio burden on small 
business concerns with fewer than 25 employees.
    The FCC may not conduct or sponsor a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. No person 
shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection 
of information subject to the PRA that does not display a valid OMB 
control number.

DATES: Written PRA comments should be submitted on or before January 
30, 2026. If you anticipate that you will be submitting comments but

Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 151, 154(i) and (j), 325, 338, 534, 
535, 551, 552, and 573.

    Needs and Uses: Under Section 614 of the Communications Act and the 
implementing rules adopted by the Commission, commercial TV broadcast 
stations are entitled to assert mandatory carriage rights on cable 
systems located within the station's television market. Under Section 
325(b) of the Communications Act, commercial TV broadcast stations are 
entitled to negotiate with local cable systems for carriage of their 
signal pursuant to retransmission consent agreements in lieu of 
asserting must carry rights. This system is therefore referred to as 
``Must-Carry and Retransmission Consent.'' Under Section 615 of the

[[Page 55117]]

Communications Act, noncommercial educational (NCE) stations are also 
entitled to assert mandatory carriage rights on cable systems located 
within the station's market; however, noncommercial TV broadcast 
stations are not entitled to retransmission consent.
    In 2019, the Commission adopted new rules governing the delivery 
and form of carriage election notices. Electronic Delivery of MVPD 
Communications, Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative, MB Docket 
Nos. 17-105, 17-317, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking, FCC 19-69, 34 FCC Rcd 5922(2019) (2019 Report and Order). 
That decision modernized the carriage election notice rules by moving 
the process online for most broadcasters and multichannel video 
programming distributors (MVPDs), but the Commission sought comment on 
how to apply these updated rules to certain small broadcast stations 
and MVPDs.
    In 2020, the Commission adopted a Report and Order that resolved 
the remaining issues regarding carriage election notice rules for small 
broadcast stations and MVPDs. Electronic Delivery of MVPD 
Communications, Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative, MB Docket 
Nos. 17-105, 17-317, Report and Order, FCC 20-14, 2020 WL 948697 (rel. 
Feb. 25, 2020) (2020 Report and Order). Pursuant to that decision, the 
obligations of certain small broadcasters and MVPDs were slightly 
modified.
    The Commission is seeking an extension without change of this 
currently approved collection for the full three-year period.

Federal Communications Commission.
Marlene Dortch,
Secretary.
