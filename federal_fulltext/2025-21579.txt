    On June 28, 2023, the Copyright Royalty Judges (Judges) adopted 
final regulations governing the rates and terms of copyright royalty 
payments under section 118 of the Copyright Act for the license period 
2023-2027. See 88 FR 41827. Pursuant to these regulations, on or before 
December 1 of each year, the Judges shall publish in the Federal 
Register notice of the change in the cost of living and a revised 
schedule of the rates codified at Sec.  381.5(c)(3) and (4) relating to 
compositions in the repertory of SESAC and GMR. The adjustment, fixed 
to the nearest dollar, shall be the greater of (1) the change in the 
cost of living as determined by the Consumer Price Index (all 
consumers, all items) (``CPI-U'') ``during the period from the most 
recent index published prior to the previous notice to the most recent 
index published prior to December 1 of that year'' or (2) 1.5%. 37 CFR 
381.10.
    The change in the cost of living as determined by the CPI-U during 
the period from the most recent index published prior to the previous 
notice, i.e., before December 1, 2024, to the most recent index 
published before December 1, 2025, is 2.9%.\1\ In accordance with 37 
CFR 381.10(b), the Judges announce that the COLA for calendar year 2026 
shall be 2.9%. Application of the 2.9% COLA to the 2025 rates for the 
performance of published nondramatic musical compositions in the 
repertory of SESAC and GMR--$199 per station--results in an adjusted 
rate of $205 per station, rounded to the nearest dollar.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The CPI-U announced on October 24, 2025, by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics in its Consumer Price Index News Release--Consumer 
Price Index, is available at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf">https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf</a> at Table 1. The Copyright Royalty Judges note that the 
October 24, 2025, publication is the most recent CPI-U published by 
the Secretary of Labor before December 1 of the preceding year of 
this COLA adjustment (i.e., 2026). The Bureau of Labor statistics 
has explained ``BLS could not collect October 2025 reference period 
survey data due to a lapse in appropriations.'' See <a href="https://www.bls.gov/bls/2025-lapse-revised-release-dates.htm">https://www.bls.gov/bls/2025-lapse-revised-release-dates.htm</a> (last visited 
Nov. 25, 2025). The ``change in the cost of living during the period 
from the most recent index published prior to the previous notice to 
the most recent index published prior to December 1'' of this year, 
i.e., the change from October 2024 to September 2025, is 2.9% 
((324.800-315.664)/315.664).
