Facility License Notifications; Withdrawal

AGENCY: National Indian Gaming Commission

ACTION: Direct final rule; withdrawal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: Due to the receipt of adverse comments, the National Indian 
Gaming Commission (NIGC) is withdrawing the direct final rule 
``Facility License Notifications,'' published September 29, 2025.

DATES: Effective November 24, 2025, the direct final rule published at 
90 FR 46470, September 29, 2025, is withdrawn.

FOR FURTHER CONTACT INFORMATION CONTACT: Jo-Ann M. Shyloski, Office of 
General Counsel at the National Indian Gaming Commission, at (202) 632-
7003 or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3851565e577856515f5b165f574e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e38a8d858ca38d8a8480cd848c95">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 29, 2025, the NIGC published a 
direct final rule (90 FR 46470). We stated in that direct final rule 
that if we received adverse comments by October 29, 2025, the direct 
final rule would not take effect, and we would publish a timely 
withdrawal in the Federal Register. The NIGC subsequently received 
adverse comments on that direct final rule and is therefore withdrawing 
this direct final rule. The NIGC may issue a notice of proposed 
rulemaking in a future edition of the Federal Register to initiate 
action to repromulgate the rule that is withdrawn today. In any such 
action, the NIGC would address the adverse comments it received on the 
direct final rule.

National Indian Gaming Commission.

Acting Chairwoman.
