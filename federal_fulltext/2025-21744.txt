Notice of Availability of Proposed Voluntary Agreement for Golden 
Gate National Recreation Area, San Francisco Maritime National 
Historical Park, Point Reyes National Seashore, and Muir Woods National 
Monument

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Notice of availability.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA, in cooperation with the National Park Service (NPS), 
has initiated the development of a voluntary agreement pursuant to the 
National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000 (the Act) and its 
implementing regulations. The Act allows the FAA and NPS to enter into 
voluntary agreements with commercial air tour operators. A voluntary 
agreement manages commercial air tour operations over a national park 
by establishing conditions for the conduct of the commercial air tour 
operations. Implementation of a voluntary agreement helps protect park 
resources and the visitor experience without compromising aviation 
safety or the air traffic control system. This notice announces the 
public availability of the proposed voluntary agreement for Golden Gate 
National Recreation Area, San Francisco Maritime National Historical 
Park, Point Reyes National Seashore, and Muir Woods National Monument.

DATES: Comments are due by 10:59 p.m. PDT January 2, 2026.

ADDRESSES: Comments will be received on the NPS Planning, Environment 
and Public Comment System (PEPC) website. The PEPC website address is: 
<a href="https://parkplanning.nps.gov/bayareaairtours25">https://parkplanning.nps.gov/bayareaairtours25</a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FAA is issuing this notice pursuant to 
the National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000 (Pub. L. 106-181 
(https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/106/public/

[[Page 55329]]

181?link-type=html)) and its implementing regulations contained in 
title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, part 136, subpart B, National 
Parks Air Tour Management. The Act requires that commercial air tour 
operators conducting or intending to conduct commercial air tours over 
a unit of the National Park system to apply to the FAA for operating 
authority before engaging in that activity. The Act further requires 
the FAA and the NPS to establish an air tour management plan (ATMP) for 
each National Park System unit for which one or more commercial air 
tour applications have been submitted unless that unit is exempt from 
this requirement.
    As an alternative to an ATMP, the FAA and the NPS may enter into a 
voluntary agreement with a commercial air tour operator who has applied 
to conduct commercial air tour operations over a national park 
including an operator that has interim operating authority for the park 
or a new entrant commercial air tour operator. Voluntary agreements 
must address the management issues necessary to protect the resources 
and visitor use of the park without compromising aviation safety or the 
air traffic control system. A voluntary agreement may also include 
conditions for the conduct of air tour operations and provisions to 
ensure stability of and compliance with the voluntary agreement. Each 
voluntary agreement reflects the provisions and conditions appropriate 
for the national park to which the agreement applies.
    The San Francisco Bay Area Parks ATMP was finalized on January 11, 
2023. A subsequent lawsuit led to a court order that the ATMP be 
vacated (Marin Audubon Society v. Federal Aviation Administration, 121 
F.4th 902 (D.C. Cir. 2024)), though the ATMP temporarily remains in 
place due to a stay of that order. Consequently, the agencies 
determined that development of a voluntary agreement is appropriate to 
comply with NPATMA before the end of the court's stay on February 28, 
2026. Operators have agreed to engage in the voluntary agreement 
process.
    Individual voluntary agreements will be established with each 
operator for the Park. Part 135 operators who have been granted interim 
operating authority for the Parks are included in this voluntary 
agreement and operators who have applied for authority to conduct tours 
of the Park are also included.
    Written comments on the proposed voluntary agreement can be 
submitted via PEPC. Comments will not be accepted by fax, email, or any 
other way than as specified above. All written comments become part of 
the official record. Before including your address, phone number, email 
address, or other personal identifying information in your comment, you 
should be aware that your entire comment, including your personal 
identifying information, may be made publicly available at any time. 
While you can ask us in your comment to withhold your personal 
identifying information from public review, we cannot guarantee that we 
will be able to do so.
