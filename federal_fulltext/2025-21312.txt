II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. Chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a request for renewal of 
an existing collection of information to OMB for review entitled, 
``Disposal of High-Level Radioactive Waste in Geologic Repositories.'' 
The NRC hereby informs potential respondents that an agency may not 
conduct or sponsor, and that a person is not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on September 3, 2025, 90 FR 
42621.
    1. The title of the information collection: Disposal of High-Level 
Radioactive Waste in Geologic Repositories.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0127.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: Once.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: State or Indian 
Tribes, or their representatives, requesting consultation with the NRC 
staff regarding review of a potential high-level radioactive waste 
geologic repository site, or wishing to participate in a license 
application review for a potential geologic repository (other than a 
potential geologic repository site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, which is 
regulated under part 63 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
(10 CFR), ``Disposal of High-Level Radioactive Wastes In a Geologic 
Repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.''
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 3.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 1.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 121.
    10. Abstract: 10 CFR part 60 requires States and Indian Tribes to 
submit certain information to the NRC if they request consultation with 
the NRC staff concerning the review of a potential repository site or 
wish to participate in a license application review for a potential 
repository (other than the Yucca Mountain, Nevada site, which is 
regulated under 10 CFR part 63). States and Indian Tribes are required 
to submit information regarding requests for consultation with the NRC 
and participation in the review of a site characterization plan and/or 
license application, but only if they wish to obtain NRC consultation 
services and/or participate in the reviews. The information submitted 
by the States and Indian Tribes is used by the Director of the Office 
of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards as a basis for decisions 
about the commitment of NRC staff resources to the consultation and 
participation efforts. All of the information collection requirements 
pertaining to Yucca Mountain are included in 10 CFR part 63 and 
approved by OMB under control number 3150-0199.

    Dated: November 24, 2025.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Heather Dempsey,
Acting NRC Clearance Officer, Office of the Chief Information Officer.
