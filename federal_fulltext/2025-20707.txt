NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[NRC-2025-0149]


Draft Interim Staff Guidance: Treatment of Certain Loss-of-
Coolant Accident Locations as Beyond-Design-Basis Accidents

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Draft guidance; request for comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is soliciting 
public comment on its draft Interim Staff Guidance (ISG), DSS-ISG-XX, 
``Treatment of Certain Loss-of-Coolant Accident Locations as Beyond-
Design-Basis Accidents.'' The purpose of the ISG is to communicate the 
key safety principles that would enable the NRC staff to determine that 
certain break locations that would normally be analyzed as design-basis 
loss-of-coolant accidents (LOCAs) for light-water reactors can be 
treated as beyond-design-basis accidents.

DATES: Submit comments by December 24, 2025. Comments received after 
this date will be considered if it is practical to do so, but the 
Commission is able to ensure consideration only for comments received 
before this date.

ADDRESSES: You may submit comments by any of the following methods; 
however, the NRC encourages electronic comment submission through the 
Federal rulemaking website:

II. Background

    The emergency core cooling system (ECCS) performance requirements 
in section 50.46 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR), ``Acceptance criteria for emergency core cooling systems for 
light-water nuclear power reactors,'' assume as their starting point 
that a LOCA has occurred. Such an approach is called ``non-
mechanistic'' and presumes reactor coolant pressure boundary rupture 
without regard to cause. Mechanistic (i.e., based on physical processes 
or phenomena) rationales for determining that certain LOCAs are 
unlikely to occur have generally not been accepted.
    The NRC, however, has accepted mechanistic rationales for 
dispositioning certain phenomena for limited purposes. For example, the 
dynamic effects of pipe ruptures can be excluded from consideration in 
the design bases under 10 CFR part 50, Appendix A, ``General Design 
Criteria [(GDC)] for Nuclear Power Plants,'' GDC

[[Page 53010]]

4 if certain conditions are met. Specifically, the NRC needs to review 
and approve analyses that demonstrate that the probability of fluid 
system piping rupture is ``extremely low'' under conditions consistent 
with the design basis for the piping. The determination that the 
probability of pipe ruptures is extremely low under GDC 4 is only for 
the analysis of dynamic effects and does not apply to the design-basis 
LOCA spectrum usually used to calculate ECCS or containment 
performance, among other aspects of system, structure, or component 
design. The NRC has nonetheless begun considering other aspects of 
reactor design for which engineering analysis methods have developed to 
a point that mechanistic considerations may be employed to exclude some 
LOCAs from the design basis while continuing to maintain high level of 
probability that the emergency core cooling function will be 
accomplished. Other design-basis analyses that depend on the results of 
ECCS analyses may also be affected by this approach. Further, the NRC 
has begun rulemaking efforts to apply relaxed analytical methods to 
certain classes of LOCAs.
    The NRC is currently considering circumstances under which an 
alternative interpretation of the design-basis LOCA spectrum may be 
found to be acceptable. For some applications now under review and 
anticipated to be submitted in the near to medium term, designers have 
sought to holistically reduce LOCA risks (e.g., reduced numbers of 
penetrations, larger volumes of water above the core, extended coping 
times, passive cooling systems). In consideration of design-specific 
information, the NRC can review justifications that design-basis LOCAs 
need not be postulated at all conceivable locations.
    This draft guidance describes the mechanistic considerations that 
the NRC staff may consider in determining whether an applicant has 
proposed an adequately protective design-basis LOCA spectrum.
