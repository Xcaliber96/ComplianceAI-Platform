SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Authority for This Rulemaking

    The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is 
found in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, Section 106, 
describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, 
Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's 
authority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described 
in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, 
the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of 
the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the 
efficient use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority as it would modify Class E airspace to support IFR operations 
at Ralph Wien Memorial Airport, Kotzebue, AK.

Comments Invited

    The FAA invites interested persons to participate in this 
rulemaking by

[[Page 52900]]

submitting written comments, data, or views. Comments are specifically 
invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, 
environmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal. The most 
helpful comments reference a specific portion of the proposal, explain 
the reason for any recommended change, and include supporting data. To 
ensure the docket does not contain duplicate comments, commenters 
should submit only one time if comments are filed electronically, or 
commenters should send only one copy of written comments if comments 
are filed in writing.
    The FAA will file in the docket all comments it receives, as well 
as a report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA 
personnel concerning this proposed rulemaking. Before acting on this 
proposal, the FAA will consider all comments it receives on or before 
the closing date for comments. The FAA will consider comments filed 
after the comment period has closed if it is possible to do so without 
incurring expense or delay. The FAA may change this proposal in light 
of the comments it receives.
    Privacy: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(c), DOT solicits comments 
from the public to better inform its rulemaking process. DOT posts 
these comments, without edit, including any personal information the 
commenter provides, to <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a>, as described in the system 
of records notice (DOT/ALL-14 FDMS), which can be reviewed at

Incorporation by Reference

    Class E2 and E5 airspace designations are published in paragraphs 
6002 and 6005, respectively, of FAA Order JO 7400.11, Airspace 
Designations and Reporting Points, which is incorporated by reference 
in 14 CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This document proposes to amend the 
current version of that order, FAA Order JO 7400.11K, dated August 4, 
2025, and effective September 15, 2025. These updates would be 
published in the next update to FAA Order JO 7400.11. FAA Order JO 
7400.11K, which lists Class A, B, C, D, and E airspace areas, air 
traffic service routes, and reporting points, is publicly available as 
listed in the ADDRESSES section of this document.

The Proposal

    The FAA is proposing an amendment to 14 CFR part 71 that would 
modify the Class E airspace at Ralph Wien Memorial Airport, Kotzebue, 
AK. First, the FAA proposes increasing Class E2 surface area airspace 
radius from 4.3-miles to 4.4-miles to better accommodate the circling 
maneuvering areas to runways (RWY) 18 and 9. Further, 1.4-mile and 0.6-
mile extensions are proposed to the southeast and west, respectively, 
to contain departing aircraft until reaching the base of the next 
adjacent airspace when executing the COGAS2 Area Navigation (RNAV) 
(Required Navigation Performance [RNP]) DEPARTURE and BALIN2 RNAV (RNP) 
DEPARTURE from RWYs 9 and 27.
    Next, the FAA proposes modifying Class E5 airspace extending upward 
from 700 feet above the surface to remove unneeded controlled airspace 
to the northeast, east, southwest, and west, and expanding E5 airspace 
to targeted areas southeast and northwest of the airport. The southeast 
should be expanded to better contain aircraft until reaching 1,200 feet 
above the surface on the RNAV (Global Positioning System [GPS]) RWY 27 
missed approach procedure and BALIN2 RNAV (RNP) DEPARTURE RWY 9. An 
additional 1x5-mile area of airspace to the northwest would provide 
sufficient containment for arriving aircraft that descend to below 
1,500 feet above the surface on the instrument landing system (ILS) or 
localizer (LOC) RWY 9 approach.

Regulatory Notices and Analyses

    The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves 
an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and 
routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. 
It, therefore: (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under 
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); 
and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the 
anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that 
will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is 
certified that this proposed rule, when promulgated, will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Environmental Review

    This proposal will be subject to an environmental analysis in 
accordance with FAA Order 1050.1G, FAA National Environmental Policy 
Act Implementing Procedures, prior to any FAA final regulatory action.
