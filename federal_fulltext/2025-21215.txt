CHEMICAL SAFETY AND HAZARD INVESTIGATION BOARD

40 CFR Part 1600

RIN 3301-AA02


Internal Governance

AGENCY: U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board 
(``CSB'') is amending regulations relating to its CSB's internal 
organization, management, and operations. These amendments make 
grammatical and stylistic updates to current CSB internal regulations 
in order to improve their function and better reflect the CSB's 
mission. The amendments also clarify procedures involving quorum and 
public meetings. Finally, the amendments update the current address of 
the CSB.

DATES: This rule is effective January 26, 2026.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven Messer, Acting General Counsel, 
202.815.8019, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#76250213001318583b13050513043615051458111900"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1e4d6a7b687b7030537b6d6d7b6c5e7d6d7c30797168">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The CSB is authorized by 42 U.S.C. 
7412(r)(6)(M) to establish such procedural and administrative rules as 
are necessary to the exercise of its functions and duties. Pursuant to 
this authority, on November 20, 2003, through 68 FR 65403, the CSB 
issued regulations governing its internal operations and structure. On 
June 2, 2023, through 88 FR 36256, the CSB published amendments to the 
regulations. The CSB now amends these internal regulations to improve 
their function, better reflect the CSB's mission, clarify quorum and 
public meeting requirements, update information about the CSB, and 
correct grammatical and stylistic issues.
    As the CSB is nonregulatory in nature, the word ``nonregulatory'' 
is added to 40 CFR 1600.1 to describe the CSB and its core mission. The 
list of offices within the CSB under 40 CFR 1600.2 is consolidated into 
paragraph form and grammatical changes are made in order to improve the 
readability of this section. Under 40 CFR 1600.3 (c), ``safety videos 
and other safety products'' has been added to accurately reflect the 
types of safety products produced by the CSB. Under 40 CFR 1600.4(a), 
the word ``financial'' has been replaced with the more general word 
``other'' to describe the work performed by the CSB's different 
offices. Additional language is added to 40 CFR 1600.5(a) to clarify 
what constitutes a quorum of the Board based on how many Board Members 
are in office at one time. 40 CFR 1600.5(b) has been updated to reflect 
that the Board must consider a calendared notation item at a public 
meeting in 60 days, not 90. 40 CFR 1600.5(c) is amended to allow for 
public meetings to be held in-person or virtually, which accurately 
reflects the CSB's current practices. 40 CFR 1600.5(c)(1) is 
reorganized to provide the same information that is currently

[[Page 54243]]

provided in bullets (i) and (ii) concerning consideration and vote on 
any notation items calendared, but in simpler paragraph form. 40 CFR 
1600.5(c)(2) is modified to eliminate the two-day requirement for 
publishing public meeting agenda information. Finally, 40 CFR 1600.6 
deletes the office location of the CSB, as the CSB does not currently 
occupy a physical office, but may in the future.
    This rule is not a significant rule for purposes of Executive Order 
12866 and has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the CSB certifies that 
these regulatory amendments will not have a significant impact on small 
business entities.

6. Revise Sec.  1600.5 to read as follows:


Sec.  1600.5  Quorum and voting requirements.

    (a) Quorum requirements. A quorum of the Board for the transaction 
of business shall consist of three Members; provided, however, that if 
the number of Board Members in office is fewer than three, a quorum 
shall consist of the number of Members in Office, subject to the 
limitations on the authority of a single Member Board set forth in this 
section and in Board Orders adopted by the Board; and provided further 
that on any matter of business as to which the number of Members in 
office, minus the number of Members who have disqualified themselves 
from consideration of such matter is two, those two Members shall 
constitute a quorum for purposes of such matter; and provided further 
that on any matter of business as to which the number of Members in 
office, minus the number of Members who have disqualified themselves 
from consideration of such matter is only one, that one member shall 
not constitute a quorum for purposes of such matter. Once a quorum is 
constituted, a simple majority of voting Members is required to approve 
an item of the Board's business, subject to the limitations on the 
authority of a single-Member Board set forth in this section and in 
Board Orders adopted by the Board.
    (1) A tie vote results in no action. If the Board consists of only 
a single Member (whether the Chairperson or another Member), that 
single Member may not transact Board business or take any action that 
requires approval by the Board, except as provided in Board Orders 
adopted by the Board. Regulations, rules, and Board Orders of the CSB 
may be approved, amended, rescinded, or revoked only by a majority vote 
of the Board. In the event that the Board consists of only a single 
Member (whether the Chairperson or another Member), that single Member 
may not approve, amend, rescind, or revoke any regulation, rule, or 
Board Order of the CSB.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Voting. The Board votes on items of business in meetings 
conducted pursuant to the Government in the Sunshine Act. 
Alternatively, whenever a Member of the Board is of the opinion that 
joint deliberation among the members of the Board upon any matter at a 
meeting is unnecessary in light of the nature of the matter, 
impracticable, or would impede the orderly disposition of agency 
business, such matter may be disposed of by employing notation voting 
procedures. A written notation of the vote of each participating
    Board member shall be recorded by the General Counsel who shall 
retain it in the records of the Board. If a Board member votes to 
calendar a notation item in accordance with applicable Board Orders, 
the Board must consider the calendared notation item at a public 
meeting of the Board within 60 days of the date on which the item is 
calendared. This section does not permit a notation item to be 
calendared other than as provided in applicable Board Orders. A 
notation vote to schedule a public meeting or a special meeting may not 
be calendared. The Chairperson shall add any calendared notation item 
to the agenda for the next CSB public meeting if one is to occur within 
60 days or schedule a special meeting to consider any calendared 
notation item no later than 60 days from the calendar action. Any 
disagreement about whether a notation item has been calendared 
effectively in accordance with applicable Board Orders shall be decided 
by the Board.
    (c) Public meetings and agendas. The Chairperson, or in the absence 
of a chairperson, a member designated by the Board, shall schedule a 
minimum of four public meetings per year, which may be in person or 
virtual.
    (1) Agenda. The Chairperson, or in the absence of a chairperson, a 
member designated by the Board, shall be responsible for preparation of 
a final meeting agenda. The final agenda may not differ in substance 
from the items published in the Sunshine Act notice for that meeting. 
Any member may submit agenda items related to CSB business for 
consideration at any public

[[Page 54244]]

meeting in accordance with applicable Board Orders, and the Chairperson 
shall include such items on the agenda. At a minimum, each public 
meeting shall include consideration and vote on any notation items 
calendared since the date of the last public meeting.
    (2) Publication of agenda information. The Chairperson shall be 
responsible for posting information related to any agenda item that is 
appropriate for public release on the CSB website.
