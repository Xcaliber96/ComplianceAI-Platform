Recommendations for Restoring American Seafood Competitiveness; 
Reopening of Comment Period

AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

ACTION: Notice; reopening of comment period.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: On August 27, 2025, NMFS published a Federal Register request 
for comment on suggestions to improve fisheries management and science 
within the requirements of applicable laws, as required in the 
Executive Order titled ``Restoring American Seafood Competitiveness''. 
The request for comment provided a 45-day comment period, which closed 
on October 14, 2025. Due to the lapse in appropriations that occurred 
during the comment period, NMFS has determined that reopening the 
comment period until December 15, 2025, is appropriate to allow 
interested parties additional time to prepare and submit comments. 
Therefore, NMFS is reopening the comment period.

DATES: The comment period is reopened from December 1, 2025 to December 
15, 2025. Comments must be received by 11:59 p.m. EDT on December 15, 
2025.

ADDRESSES: Responses should be submitted via email to 
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d4bab9b2a7faa7b1b5b2bbbbb0a7a0a6b5a0b1b3ad94babbb5b5fab3bba2"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="442a2922376a372125222b2b20373036253021233d042a2b25256a232b32">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Include ``E.O. 14276 Notice Response''

14276 titled ``Restoring American Seafood Competitiveness.'' (90 FR 
41818). The request for comment provided a 45-day comment period, which
