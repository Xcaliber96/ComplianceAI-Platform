SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    Innovative manufacturing technologies--including but not limited to 
continuous manufacturing, distributed manufacturing, modern aseptic 
manufacturing equipment and processes, and novel analytical methods--
can increase product development speed, bolster supply chains, improve 
drug quality, and prevent drug shortages. On June 8, 2023, FDA 
supported and participated in a public workshop hosted by the Duke-
Margolis Center for Health Policy on ``Advancing the Utilization and 
Supporting the Implementation of Innovative Manufacturing Approaches.'' 
At this workshop, interested parties from industry shared feedback on 
their interactions with the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and 
Research (CDER) Emerging Technology Program (ETP) and Center for 
Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Advanced Technologies Team 
(CATT) to guide submissions from persons or organizations using 
innovative manufacturing technologies. Regulators, academic 
researchers, and industry representatives discussed the current 
barriers to using these technologies and shared ideas on how 
initiatives such as the newly created Advanced Manufacturing 
Technologies Designation Program (AMTDP) could alleviate these 
barriers. The intent of this workshop was to fulfill a PDUFA VII 
commitment related to advancing utilization and implementation of 
innovative manufacturing, as well as section 506L(e)(1) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by section 3213 of the Food 
and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 regarding the AMTDP.
    Based on lessons learned from the Agency's experience with 
submissions involving advanced manufacturing, the topics discussed 
during the June 8, 2023, workshop, and other public input, including 
public comments received in response to the draft strategy document 
announced in the Federal Register on September 12, 2024 (89 FR 74279), 
FDA developed the Strategy Document. The Strategy Document outlines the 
specific activities FDA has undertaken or intends to undertake to 
facilitate the use of innovative manufacturing technologies, including: 
continuing to enhance the ETP and CATT as a mechanism to support 
innovation; implementing the AMTDP in a manner that incorporates 
feedback on eligibility criteria; continuing to identify opportunities 
for international harmonization of regulatory expectations in support 
of further adoption of advanced manufacturing; supporting and utilizing 
ongoing initiatives for advanced manufacturing to address potential 
barriers; and supporting training in advanced manufacturing for FDA 
regulatory staff.
    The Strategy Document will be made available on the following FDA
