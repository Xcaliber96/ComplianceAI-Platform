SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Executive Summary

A. Does this action apply to me?

    This action provides information that is directed to the public in 
general.

B. What is the Agency's authority for taking this action?

    EPA regulations for residues of pesticide chemicals in or on 
various food commodities are established under section 408 of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a. FFDCA 
section 408(d)(3), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d)(3), requires EPA to publish a 
notice of receipt of these petitions in the Federal Register and 
provide an opportunity for public comment on the requests.

C. What action is the Agency taking?

    As specified in FFDCA section 408(d)(3), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d)(3), EPA 
is publishing notice of the receipt of pesticide petitions filed under 
FFDCA section 408 that request the establishment or modification of 
regulations for residues of pesticide chemicals in or on various food 
commodities. The Agency is taking public comment on the requests before 
responding to the petitioner. Pursuant to 40 CFR 180.7(f), a summary of 
the petition identified in this document, prepared by the petitioner, 
is included in a docket. EPA has determined that the pesticide 
petitions described in this document contain data or information 
prescribed in FFDCA section 408(d)(2), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d)(2), and 40 CFR 
180.7(b); however, EPA has not fully evaluated the sufficiency of the 
submitted data at this time or whether the data supports granting the 
pesticide petitions. After considering the public comments, EPA intends 
to evaluate whether and what action may be warranted. Additional data 
may be needed before EPA can make a final determination on these 
pesticide petitions.
    Based upon review of the data supporting these petitions and in 
accordance with its authority under FFDCA section 408(d)(4)(A)(i), EPA 
may establish a final tolerance or tolerance exemption that ``may vary 
from that sought by the petitioner.'' For example, EPA may determine 
that it is appropriate to vary the commodity

name for consistency with EPA's Food and Feed Commodity Vocabulary, 
which is located here <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-tolerances/food-and-feed-commodity-vocabulary">https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-tolerances/food-and-feed-commodity-vocabulary</a>, or vary the tolerance level based on 
available data, harmonization interests, or the trailing zeros policy. 
In addition, when evaluating a petition's requests for a tolerance or 
exemption, EPA will consider how use of the pesticide on a crop for 
which a tolerance is requested may result in residues in or on 
commodities related to that requested commodity (e.g., whether use on 
sugar beets for which a tolerance was requested on sugar beet root also 
requires a tolerance on sugar beet tops or whether use on a cereal 
grain for which a grain tolerance was requested also requires a 
tolerance on related animal feed commodities derived from that cereal 
grain). Public commenters should consider the possibility of such 
revisions in preparing comments on these petitions.

D. What should I consider as I prepare my comments for EPA?

    1. Submitting CBI. Do not submit CBI to EPA through <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> or email. If you wish to include CBI in your 
comment, please follow the applicable instructions at <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets#rules">https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets#rules</a> and clearly mark the 
information that you claim to be CBI. In addition to one complete 
version of the comment that includes CBI, a copy of the comment without 
CBI must be submitted for inclusion in the public docket. Information 
marked as CBI will not be disclosed except in accordance with 
procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2.
    2. Tips for preparing your comments. When preparing and submitting 
your comments, see the commenting tips at <a href="https://www.epa.gov//commenting-epa-dockets">https://www.epa.gov//commenting-epa-dockets</a>.
