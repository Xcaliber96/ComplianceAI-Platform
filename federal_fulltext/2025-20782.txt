DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

[Docket No. CP26-4-000]


Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC; Notice of Scoping 
Period Requesting Comments on Environmental Issues for the Proposed 
North Padre Island Lateral Abandonment Project

    The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or 
Commission) will prepare an environmental document that will discuss 
the environmental impacts of the North Padre Island Lateral Abandonment 
Project involving the abandonment of pipeline facilities by 
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) in Brooks, Jim 
Wells, Kenedy, and Kleberg counties, Texas. The Commission will use 
this environmental document in its decision-making process to determine 
whether the project is in the public convenience and necessity.
    This notice announces the opening of the scoping process the 
Commission will use to gather input from the public and interested 
agencies regarding the project. As part of the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA) review process, the Commission takes into account 
concerns the public may have about proposals and the environmental 
impacts that could result from its action whenever it considers the 
issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. This 
gathering of public input is referred to as ``scoping.'' The main goal 
of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the environmental 
document on the important environmental issues. Additional information 
about the Commission's NEPA process is described below in the NEPA 
Process and Environmental Document section of this notice.
    By this notice, the Commission requests public comments on the 
scope of issues to address in the environmental document. To ensure 
that your comments are timely and properly recorded, please submit your 
comments so that the Commission receives them in Washington, DC on or 
before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 19, 2025. Comments may be 
submitted in written form. Further details on how to submit comments 
are provided in the Public Participation section of this notice.
    Your comments should focus on the potential environmental effects, 
reasonable alternatives, and measures to avoid or lessen environmental 
impacts. Your input will help the Commission staff determine what 
issues they need to evaluate in the environmental document. Commission 
staff will consider all written comments during the preparation of the 
environmental document.
    If you submitted comments on this project to the Commission before 
the opening of this docket on October 8, 2025, you will need to file 
those comments in Docket No. CP26-4-000 to ensure they are considered 
as part of this proceeding.
    This notice is being sent to the Commission's current environmental 
mailing list for this project. State and local government 
representatives should notify their constituents of this proposed 
project and encourage them to comment on their areas of concern.
    If you are a landowner receiving this notice, a pipeline company 
representative may contact you about the acquisition of an easement to 
abandon the proposed facilities. The company would seek to negotiate a 
mutually acceptable easement agreement. You are not required to enter 
into an agreement. However, if the Commission approves the project, the 
Natural Gas Act conveys the right of eminent domain to the company. 
Therefore, if you and the company do not reach an easement agreement, 
the pipeline company could initiate condemnation proceedings in court. 
In

[[Page 52946]]

such instances, compensation would be determined by a judge in 
accordance with state law. The Commission does not subsequently grant, 
exercise, or oversee the exercise of that eminent domain authority. The 
courts have exclusive authority to handle eminent domain cases; the 
Commission has no jurisdiction over these matters.
    Transco provided landowners with a fact sheet prepared by the FERC 
entitled ``An Interstate Natural Gas Facility On My Land? What Do I 
Need To Know?'' which addresses typically asked questions, including 
the use of eminent domain and how to participate in the Commission's 
proceedings. This fact sheet along with other landowner topics of 
interest are available for viewing on the FERC website (<a href="http://www.ferc.gov">www.ferc.gov</a>) 
under the Natural Gas, Landowner Topics link.

Summary of the Proposed Project

    Transco proposes to abandon approximately 50 miles of 24-inch-
diameter interstate natural gas transmission pipeline and associated 
facilities in Brooks, Jim Wells, Kenedy, and Kleberg counties, Texas. 
This pipeline, which also extends across the Padre Island National 
Seashore into the Gulf of America would mostly be abandoned in-place 
(45 miles). With exceptions, small segments of the pipeline would be 
abandoned by removal per landowner easement agreements, under state and 
federal highways, railroad crossings, and on lands managed by the Texas 
General Land Office (5 miles). Transco would also abandon a non-
jurisdictional dehydration and storage facility (Station 14) in Brooks 
County, Texas. According to Transco, its project would eliminate costs 
and risks associated with maintenance of these facilities.
    The general location of the project facilities is shown in appendix 
1.\1\

free, (886) 208-3676 or TTY (202) 502-8659.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Land Requirements for Construction

    Transco would require the use of its existing permanent easement 
and additional temporary workspaces to abandon the proposed facilities, 
a total of approximately 500 acres of land. Following the abandonment 
of the North Padre Island Abandonment Project, Transco would relinquish 
its permanent easement to the respective property owner(s). On state 
and federal lands, Transco would comply with respective agency 
requirements.

NEPA Process and the Environmental Document

    Any environmental document issued by the Commission will discuss 
impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation 
of the proposed project under the relevant general resource areas:
    <bullet> geology and soils;
    <bullet> water resources and wetlands;
    <bullet> vegetation and wildlife;
    <bullet> threatened and endangered species;
    <bullet> cultural resources;
    <bullet> land use; and
    <bullet> air quality and noise.
    Commission staff will also evaluate reasonable alternatives to the 
proposed project or portions of the project and make recommendations on 
how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. Your 
comments will help Commission staff identify and focus on the issues 
that might have an effect on the human environment and potentially 
eliminate others from further study and discussion in the environmental 
document.
    Following this scoping period, Commission staff will determine 
whether to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) or an Environmental 
Impact Statement (EIS). The EA or the EIS will present Commission 
staff's independent analysis of the issues. If Commission staff 
prepares an EA, a Notice of Schedule for the Preparation of an 
Environmental Assessment will be issued. The EA may be issued for an 
allotted public comment period. The Commission would consider timely 
comments on the EA before making its decision regarding the proposed 
project. If Commission staff prepares an EIS, a Notice of Intent to 
Prepare an EIS/Notice of Schedule will be issued, which will open up an 
additional comment period. Staff will then prepare a draft EIS which 
will be issued for public comment. Commission staff will consider all 
timely comments received during the comment period on the draft EIS and 
revise the document, as necessary, before issuing a final EIS. Any EA 
or draft and final EIS will be available in electronic format in the 
public record through eLibrary \2\ and the Commission's natural gas 
environmental documents web page (<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/industries-data/natural-gas/environment/environmental-documents">https://www.ferc.gov/industries-data/natural-gas/environment/environmental-documents</a>). If eSubscribed, you 
will receive instant email notification when the environmental document 
is issued.

    With this notice, the Commission is asking agencies with 
jurisdiction by law

[[Page 52947]]

and/or special expertise with respect to the environmental issues of 
this project to formally cooperate in the preparation of the 
environmental document.\3\ Agencies that would like to request 
cooperating agency status should follow the instructions for filing 
comments provided under the Public Participation section of this 
notice.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

107(a)(3) of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4336(a)(3)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consultation Under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation 
Act

    In accordance with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's 
implementing regulations for section 106 of the National Historic 
Preservation Act, the Commission is using this notice to initiate 
consultation with the applicable State Historic Preservation Office(s), 
and to solicit their views and those of other government agencies, 
interested Indian tribes, and the public on the project's potential 
effects on historic properties.\4\ The environmental document for this 
project will document findings on the impacts on historic properties 
and summarize the status of consultations under section 106.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's regulations 
are at Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 800. Those 
regulations define historic properties as any prehistoric or 
historic district, site, building, structure, or object included in 
or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic 
Places.
