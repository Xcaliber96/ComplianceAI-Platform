    j. The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or 
Commission) will prepare an environmental document that will discuss 
the environmental effects of relicensing the Upper Barker Project. The 
Commission will use this environmental document in its decision-making 
process to determine whether to issue a subsequent license for the 
project.

[[Page 53295]]

    k. This notice announces the opening of the scoping process the 
Commission will use to gather input from the public and interested 
agencies regarding the project. This notice is intended to advise all 
participants as to the potential scope of the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA) document and to seek additional information pertinent 
to this analysis. Commission staff does not intend to issue a separate 
scoping document.
    As part of the NEPA review process, the Commission takes into 
account concerns the public may have about proposals and the 
environmental effects that could result from its action whenever it 
considers the issuance of a hydropower license. This gathering of 
public input is referred to as ``scoping.'' The main goal of the 
scoping process is to focus the analysis in the environmental document 
on the important environmental issues.
    l. Scoping Comments: By this notice, the Commission requests 
written public comments on the scope of issues to address in the 
environmental document. To ensure that your comments are timely and 
properly recorded, please submit your comments so that the Commission 
receives them in Washington, DC on or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 
December 1, 2025.
    Comments should focus on the potential environmental effects and 
reasonable alternatives. Your input will help the Commission staff 
determine what issues they need to evaluate in the environmental 
document. Commission staff will consider all written comments during 
the preparation of the environmental document.
    The Commission strongly encourages electronic filing. Please file 
scoping comments using the Commission's eFiling system at <a href="https://ferconline.ferc.gov/FERCOnline.aspx">https://ferconline.ferc.gov/FERCOnline.aspx</a>. Commenters can submit brief 
comments up to 10,000 characters, without prior registration, using the 
eComment system at <a href="https://ferconline.ferc.gov/QuickComment.aspx">https://ferconline.ferc.gov/QuickComment.aspx</a>. For 
assistance, please contact FERC Online Support at

Rockville, Maryland 20852. All filings must clearly identify the 
project name and docket number on the first page: Barker Mill Upper 
Hydroelectric Project (P-3562-026).
    The Commission's Rules of Practice require all intervenors filing 
documents with the Commission to serve a copy of that document on each 
person on the official service list for the project. Further, if an 
intervenor files comments or documents with the Commission relating to 
the merits of an issue that may affect the responsibilities of a 
particular resource agency, they must also serve a copy of the document 
on that resource agency.
    m. The application has been accepted for filing but is not ready 
for environmental analysis at this time.
    n. The existing Upper Barker Project consists of: (1) a 41-acre 
impoundment with a maximum storage capacity of 255 acre-feet at a 
normal maximum water surface elevation of 192 feet; \1\ (2) a dam 
consisting of (starting from the west bank): (a) a 43-foot-long 
concrete abutment; (b) a 40-foot-long gated spillway structure 
consisting of two, 18-foot-high, 15-foot-wide steel Tainter gates; (c) 
an 86-foot-long, 24-foot-high stone masonry with concrete overlay 
overflow spillway with 3-foot-high wooden flashboards and a crest 
elevation of 192 feet at the top of the flashboards (189 feet when the 
flashboards are lowered); (d) a 31-foot-long concrete intake structure; 
and, (e) a 27-foot-long underground abutment; (3) a powerhouse 
containing a single 950-kilowatt turbine-generator unit; (4) a 
tailrace; (5) a 50-foot-long, 12.47-kilovolt transmission line; and (6) 
appurtenant facilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ All elevations are referenced to the North American Vertical 
Datum of 1988.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    KEI Power filed a Settlement Agreement for the Barker's Mill 
Project (FERC No. 2808),\2\ Upper Barker Project (FERC No. 3562), and 
Marcal Project (FERC No. 11482) (Settlement) executed by and between 
the licensee and the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Maine 
Department of Marine Resources (Maine DMR), and the Maine Department of 
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (Settlement Parties). The purpose of the 
Settlement is to resolve the parties' disagreements over the issues 
related to fish and aquatic resource management, including upstream and 
downstream passage measures for American eel, river herring, American 
shad, sea lamprey, and Atlantic salmon; minimum flow releases; and 
aquatic invasive species. Specifically, for the relicensing of the 
Upper Barker Project, the Settlement provides for: (1) coordinating the 
time frame for providing upstream and downstream fish passage at the 
Upper Barker Project; (2) aligning the minimum and seasonal flows at 
the Upper Barker and the Lower Barker Projects; (3) aligning the Upper 
Barker and Lower Barker Projects' license terms by extending the 40-
year license term of the Lower Barker Project to 50 years and 
requesting a license term of 47 years for the Upper Barker Project; (4) 
establishing an off-license agreement to fund an Androscoggin Basin 
Stewardship Fund administered by Maine DMR to benefit spawning and 
rearing habitat in the basin; and (5) assuring, through an off-license 
agreement, the resources agencies' support for KEI Power's request for 
Low Impact Hydropower Institute certification for the Upper Barker 
Project.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The Barker's Mill Project is also known as and referred to 
herein as the Lower Barker Project.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Upper Barker Project is currently operated in run-of-river mode 
and generates 4,681 megawatt-hours annually.
    A copy of the application is available for review on the 
Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ferc.gov">http://www.ferc.gov</a>, using the ``eLibrary'' 
link. Enter the project's docket number, excluding the last three 
digits in the docket number field, to access the document. For 
assistance, contact FERC at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#571112051418393b3e393204222727382523173132253479303821"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e7a1a2b5a4a8898b8e8982b4929797889593a781829584c9808891">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or call toll 
free, (886) 208-3676 or TTY (202) 502-8659.
    o. NEPA Process and the Environmental Document: Any environmental 
document issued by the Commission will discuss effects that could occur 
as a result of the project's relicensing under the relevant general 
resource areas, such as:
    <bullet> geology and soils;
    <bullet> aquatic resources;
    <bullet> terrestrial resources;
    <bullet> threatened and endangered species;
    <bullet> recreation, land use, and aesthetic resources;
    <bullet> cultural resources; and
    <bullet> developmental resources.
    Commission staff will also evaluate reasonable alternatives to the 
proposed project or portions of the project and make recommendations on 
how to lessen or avoid effects on the various resource areas. Your 
comments will help Commission staff identify and focus on the issues 
that might have an effect on the human environment and potentially 
eliminate others from further discussion in the environmental document.
    Following this scoping period, Commission staff will determine 
whether to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) or an Environmental

[[Page 53296]]

Impact Statement (EIS). The EA or EIS will present Commission staff's 
independent analysis of the issues. If Commission staff prepares an EA, 
a Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Assessment will be 
issued. The EA may be issued for an allotted public comment period. The 
Commission would consider timely comments on the EA before making its 
decision regarding the proposed project. If Commission staff prepares 
an EIS, a Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement 
will be issued. Staff will then prepare a draft EIS, which will be 
issued for public comment. Commission staff will consider all timely 
comments received during the comment period on the draft EIS and revise 
the document, as necessary, before issuing a final EIS. Any EA or draft 
and final EIS will be available in electronic format in the public 
record through eLibrary. If eSubscribed, you will receive instant email 
notification when the environmental document is issued (see paragraph 
(q) of this notice for instructions on using eSubscription).
    p. The Commission's Office of Public Participation (OPP) supports 
meaningful public engagement and participation in Commission 
proceedings. OPP can help members of the public, including landowners, 
community organizations, Tribal members and others, access publicly 
available information and navigate Commission processes. For public 
inquiries and assistance with making filings such as interventions, 
comments, or requests for rehearing, the public is encouraged to
