SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Abstract

    On March 26, 2025, the President issued Proclamation 10908 (90 FR 
14705), ``Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into 
the United States,'' (Proclamation 10908) finding that imports of 
automobiles and certain automobile parts continue to threaten to impair 
the national security of the United States and imposing specified 
tariffs to adjust imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts 
so that such imports will not threaten to impair national security 
pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (``Section 
232''). Section 232 authorizes the President to adjust the imports of 
an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United 
States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to 
impair the national security of the United States so that such imports 
will not threaten to impair national security. Proclamation 10908 
imposed a 25 percent tariff on certain imports of automobiles, 
effective April 3, 2025, and certain imports of automobile parts, 
effective May 3, 2025.
    On April 29, 2025, the President issued Proclamation 10925 (90 FR 
18899), which allowed for automobile manufactures assembling 
automobiles in the United States to apply for an import adjustment 
offset amount, which would offset certain tariff liability under 
Proclamation 10908 on imports of automobile parts. Proclamation 10925 
required that within 30 days of the date of the order the Secretary of 
the Department of Commerce (Commerce) shall establish a process by 
which automobile manufacturers could submit documentation supporting 
eligibility and a claim for an import adjustment offset amount. A 
notice announced procedures for administration of the import adjustment 
offset amount program, including application, documentation, and 
certification requirements, eligibility conditions, and coordination 
with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
    Presidential Proclamation 10984 of October 17, 2025 determines that 
imports of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, their parts, and buses 
threaten to impair U.S. national security and therefore imposes 
corrective trade measures under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. 
The Proclamation establishes a 25 percent tariff on covered medium- and 
heavy-duty vehicles and parts, and a 10 percent tariff on buses and 
certain related vehicles, effective November 1, 2025. It also creates 
an import adjustment offset program allowing manufacturers that 
assemble qualifying vehicles in the United States to offset certain 
tariff liabilities based on a percentage of the value of domestically 
produced vehicles assembled between 2025 and 2030. The Secretary of 
Commerce is directed to implement application, documentation, and 
enforcement procedures in coordination with CBP, with the overarching 
objective of strengthening domestic manufacturing capacity, reducing 
reliance on foreign supply chains, and safeguarding national security 
interests.

II. Method of Collection

    Manufacturers seeking an import adjustment offset amount must 
submit documentation for each period for which an import adjustment 
offset amount is sought as defined by Commerce (i.e., one set of 
documentation for the period of April 3, 2025 through April 30, 2026; 
and a separate set of documentation for the period of May 1, 2026 
through April 30, 2027). The information collected will be used by 
Commerce staff to facilitate the Secretary's review of the applications 
and to make a determination of eligibility for the tariff offset on 
their imported parts. Manufacturers may submit their applications 
electronically to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#751400011a1a13130610013501071411105b121a03"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3e5f4b4a515158584d5b4a7e4a4c5f5a5b10595148">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
    Domestic producers of automobiles or automobile parts articles, or 
any industry association representing one or more such producers, may 
submit automobile parts articles inclusion requests during two-week 
submission windows that ITA will open four times annually at the 
beginning of each January, April, July, and October.
