14 CFR Part 39

[Docket No. FAA-2025-0922; Project Identifier MCAI-2024-00650-R; 
Amendment 39-23163; AD 2025-20-10]
RIN 2120-AA64


Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-26-
07, which applies to all Airbus Helicopters Model EC120B helicopters. 
AD 2021-26-07 requires performing repetitive inspections of the tail 
rotor (TR) hub body and, depending on the inspection results, replacing 
certain parts, and accomplishing further inspections. AD 2021-26-07 
also requires for certain helicopters removing from service any bolt, 
washer, and nut installed on the TR hub body at certain life limits and 
replacing them with airworthy parts and accomplishing further 
inspections. Additionally, AD 2021-26-07 prohibits the installation of 
a certain part-numbered TR hub body unless certain requirements are 
met. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-26-07, it was determined that 
modifying the link of the TR hub body and splined flange by adding red 
paint marks is necessary to enable the detection of any loss of 
tightening torque. This AD retains the same repetitive inspections and 
corrective actions as AD 2021-26-07 and requires modification of the 
link of the TR hub body, which is a terminating action for the 
repetitive inspections. This AD also requires repetitive inspections of 
the red paint line added during the modification of the link of the TR 
hub body for alignment. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the 
unsafe condition on these products.

DATES: This AD is effective December 30, 2025.
    The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by 
reference of certain publications listed in this AD as of December 30, 
2025.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 
CFR part 39 to supersede AD 2021-26-07, Amendment 39-21866 (86 FR 
72829, December 23, 2021) (AD 2021-26-07), which applied to all Airbus 
Helicopters Model EC120B helicopters.
    The NPRM published in the Federal Register on June 25, 2025 (90 FR 
26951). The NPRM was prompted by European Union Aviation Safety Agency 
(EASA) AD 2024-0209, dated October 28, 2024 (EASA AD 2024-0209) (also 
referred to as the MCAI). EASA, the Technical Agent for the Member 
States of the European Union, issued EASA AD 2024-0209 to address loss 
of tightening torque in the interface between the TR hub body and 
splined flange, which creates the risk of crack initiation from a 
fretting area located on the TR hub body and splined flange or on the 
TR hub body and flange bolts. The MCAI states that Airbus Helicopters 
developed a modification, which consists of adding a line of red paint 
on each bolt and each nut of the link between the TR hub and the 
splined flange. The MCAI further states that an Airworthiness 
Limitations Section task was published for checking alignment of the 
marks.
    The FAA is issuing this AD to detect cracking and fretting of the 
TR hub body, which, if not addressed, could lead to loss of the TR 
drive, and consequent loss of yaw control of the helicopter.
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2025-0922.

Discussion of Final Airworthiness Directive

Comments

    The FAA received no comments on the NPRM or on the determination of 
the costs.

Conclusion

    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority 
of another country and are approved for operation in the United States. 
Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design 
Authority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant 
data and determined that air safety requires adopting this AD as 
proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe 
condition on these products. Except for minor editorial changes, this 
AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. None of the changes will 
increase the economic burden on any operator.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed Airbus Helicopters Emergency Alert Service 
Bulletin 05A020, Revision 3, dated September 19, 2024 (EASB 05A0020 Rev 
3), which specifies procedures for repetitive inspections of the TR hub 
body for cracks and the TR spline flange for cracks and fretting and 
the appropriate corrective actions to include replacing the hub body 
and the splined flange. EASB 05A0020 Rev. 3 also excludes helicopters 
that have complied with Airbus Helicopters Alert Service Bulletin 
EC120-64-21-0001, Issue 001, dated September 19, 2024 (ASB EC120-64-21-
0001) from its effectivity and limits the effectivity for ``non 
installed equipment or parts''.
    The FAA also reviewed ASB EC120-64-21-0001, which specifies 
procedures for inspecting the torque applied on the nut of the link 
between the TR hub and the splined flange, and depending on the 
inspection results, applying torque and replacing parts. ASB EC120-64-
21-0001 also specifies procedures for applying a red paint line on the 
screw, nut, washer, TR hub, and splined flange.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Differences Between This AD and the MCAI

    EASA AD 2024-0209 allows a non-cumulative tolerance of 100 FH 
[flight hours] to be applied to the compliance times to allow for 
synchronization of the required inspections with other maintenance 
tasks, whereas this AD does not allow a non-cumulative tolerance to be 
applied to the compliance times.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 70 helicopters of U.S. 
registry. Labor rates are estimated at $85 per hour. Based on these 
numbers, the FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD.
    Visually inspecting a TR hub body for a crack takes 0.25 work-hour 
for an estimated cost of $22 per helicopter and $1,540 for the U.S. 
fleet.
    Visually inspecting a TR spline flange for corrosion, impacts, 
fretting, wear, and a crack takes 0.25 work-hour for an estimated cost 
of $22 per helicopter and $1,540 for the U.S. fleet.
    Replacing a T/R hub body bolt, washer, and nut takes 0.5 work-hour 
and parts cost $25 (per hardware set) for an estimated cost of $68 per 
helicopter.
    Inspecting torque and adding a red paint line on each bolt and each 
nut takes 4 work-hours for an estimated cost of $340 per helicopter and 
$23,800 for the U.S. fleet.
    If required, replacing a TR hub body takes 2 work-hours, and parts 
cost $16,485 for an estimated cost of $16,655 per helicopter.
    If required, replacing a TR spline flange takes 0.5 work-hour, and 
parts cost $2,950 for an estimated cost of $2,993 per helicopter.

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA

[[Page 53212]]

with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by 
prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the 
Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This 
regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses 
an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products 
identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    The FAA has determined that this AD will not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a 
substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between 
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power 
and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
