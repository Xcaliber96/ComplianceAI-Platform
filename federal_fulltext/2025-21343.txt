CIVIL RIGHTS COLD CASE RECORDS REVIEW BOARD

[Agency Docket Number: CRCCRRB-2026-0001-N]


Notice of Formal Determination on Records Release

AGENCY: Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board received 2,883 
pages of records from the National Archives and Records Administration 
(NARA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) related to three 
civil rights cold case incidents to which the Review Board assigned the 
unique identifiers 2024-003-020, 2024-003-037, and 2024-003-039. The 
agencies proposed 65 postponements in the records. The FBI later 
withdrew 17 of the postponements the Bureau proposed after consultation 
with the Review Board. On September 12 and October 3, 2025, the Review 
Board approved 22 postponements and portions of 2 additional 
postponements, and determined that 2,866 pages in full and 17 pages in 
part should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights Cold Case Records 
Collection. The Review Board is still coordinating its review of 18 
proposed postponements with the agencies because of the sensitive 
nature of the information. This information is postponed until this 
coordination is complete and the Review Board can make a final 
disclosure decision. By issuing this notice, the Review Board complies 
with the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 that 
requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its 
determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the 
Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.
