NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

Docket No. 50-255; Palisades Energy, LLC; Palisades Nuclear Plant; 
Exemption

I. Background

    Palisades Energy, LLC (Palisades, the licensee) is the holder of 
Renewed Facility Operating License No. DPR-20, which authorizes 
operation of the Palisades Nuclear Plant (Palisades). The license 
provides, among other things, that the facility is subject to all 
rules, regulations, and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC, the Commission) now or hereafter in effect. The 
facility consists of one pressurized-water reactor located in Van 
Buren County in Michigan.

II. Request/Action

    By letter dated August 12, 2025 (Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System (ADAMS) Accession No. ML25224A206), as 
supplemented by letter dated October 15, 2025 (ML25288A074), and 
pursuant to 10 CFR 26.9, ``Specific exemptions,'' the licensee 
requested a one-time exemption from the work hour requirements in 
Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) part 26, 
``Fitness for Duty Programs,'' paragraph 26.205(d), ``Work hour 
controls'' Specifically, the licensee requested to use the work hour 
requirements in 10 CFR 26.205(d)(4) and (d)(5) in lieu of the non-
outage work hour controls described in 10 CFR 26.205(d)(3) and 
(d)(7) for a period of no more than 60 days for individuals 
specified in 10 CFR 26.4(a)(1) through (a)(5), starting on November 
3, 2025, following the licensee's planned 60-day outage which 
started on

[[Page 53394]]

August 25, 2025, and ends on October 23, 2025.
    Section 26.205(d)(3) of 10 CFR, requires licensees to comply 
with the requirements for individuals to have a minimum number of 
days off per week depending on the duration of shift schedules, 
averaged over the shift cycle, and the duties being performed. 
Individuals working 8-hour shift schedules shall have at least 1 day 
off per week, and individuals who are working 10-hour shift 
schedules shall have at least 2 days off per week. Individuals 
working 12-hour shift schedules while performing the duties 
described in 10 CFR 26.4(a)(1) through (a)(3) shall have at least 
2.5 days off per week; individuals working 12-hour shift schedules 
while performing duties described in 10 CFR 26.4(a)(4) shall have at 
least 2 days off per week; and individuals working 12-hour shift 
schedules while performing duties described in 10 CFR 26.4(a)(5) 
shall have at least 3 days off per week. Section 26.205(d)(7) of 10 
CFR, requires licensees to comply with the requirements for maximum 
average work hours wherein individuals may not work more than a 
weekly average of 54 hours, calculated using an averaging period of 
up to 6 weeks, which advances by 7 consecutive calendar days at the 
finish of every averaging period. The licensee seeks a one-time 
exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 26.205(d)(3) and (d)(7).
    The requirements in 10 CFR 26.205(d)(4) provide that during the 
first 60 days of a unit outage, licensees need not meet the 
requirements of 10 CFR 26.205(d)(3) or (d)(7) for individuals 
specified in 10 CFR 26.4(a)(1) through (a)(4), while those 
individuals are working on outage activities. However, 10 CFR 
26.205(d)(4) does require the licensee to ensure individuals 
specified in 10 CFR 26.4(a)(1) through (a)(3) have at least 3 days 
off in each successive (i.e., non-rolling) 15-day period, and that 
the individuals specified in 10 CFR 26.4(a)(4) have at least 1 day 
off in any 7-day period. This is collectively known as the outage 
minimum days off (MDO) requirement. The requirements in 10 CFR 
26.205(d)(5) provide that during the first 60 days of a unit outage, 
licensees need not meet the requirements of 10 CFR 26.205(d)(3) or 
(d)(7) for individuals specified in 10 CFR 26.4(a)(5). Additionally, 
licensees shall ensure that individuals specified in 10 CFR 
26.4(a)(5) have at least 4 days off in each successive (i.e., non-
rolling) 15-day period.
    On July 24, 2025, the NRC issued a series of licensing and 
regulatory actions approving the licensee's request to reauthorize 
power operations at Palisades and return the plant to an operational 
status, including the Power Operations Technical Specifications 
(ML25157A127). In its August 12, 2025, submittal letter, the 
licensee stated that it planned to implement the power operations 
license, the final safety analysis report (FSAR), and the Power 
Operations Technical Specifications on August 25, 2025. Further, the 
licensee stated that on August 25, 2025, Palisades would transition 
directly into an outage under the Power Operation Technical 
Specifications to restore the plant for restart.
    The licensee stated that the one-time exemption from the work 
hour requirements in 10 CFR 26.205(d) is necessary for the flexible 
management of personnel and work activities to ensure the full 
restoration of safety-related equipment and completion of outage 
activities in support of plant restart at Palisades. To support the 
extended use of outage work hour controls for the initial 60-day 
outage followed by the initially proposed 49-day exemption period, 
the licensee proposed additional mitigating actions discussed in 
Section V of the Enclosure to the August 12, 2025, submittal letter.
    In the letter dated October 15, 2025, the licensee submitted a 
supplement to the proposed request for exemption. In the supplement, 
the licensee requested to increase the previously requested 49-day 
exemption period for use of the less restrictive work hour 
limitations to a 60-day exemption period to support the restart 
activities for Palisades. The licensee stated that it plans to use 
the additional time under the less restrictive work hour limitations 
to allow more flexibility for scheduling of covered work tasks and 
individual work hours to better manage cumulative fatigue. In 
addition, the licensee stated that the start date of the proposed 
exemption period of 60 days is being changed from October 24, 2025, 
to November 3, 2025.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 26.9, the Commission may, upon application by 
any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant exemptions 
from the requirements of 10 CFR part 26 when the exemptions are 
authorized by law and will not endanger life or property or the 
common defense and security; and are otherwise in the public 
interest.

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    The proposed exemption would authorize a one-time exemption from 
the requirements of 10 CFR 26.205(d)(3) and (d)(7) to allow the use 
of the less restrictive work hour controls in 10 CFR 26.205(d)(4) 
and (d)(5) for up to an additional 60 days, starting on November 3, 
2025, to allow the completion of the plant restart activities 
without violating NRC regulations. As stated, 10 CFR 26.9 allows the 
NRC to grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 26. The 
NRC staff has determined that granting the proposed exemption will 
not result in a violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, other laws, or the Commission's regulations. Therefore, the 
exemption is authorized by law.

B. The Exemption Will Not Endanger Life or Property

    The purpose of subpart I, ``Managing Fatigue,'' of 10 CFR part 
26 is to ensure that worker fatigue does not compromise the 
abilities of individuals to perform their duties safely and 
competently. The purpose of 10 CFR 26.205(d)(4) and (d)(5) is to 
provide licensees flexibility for a limited period in scheduling 
required days off while accommodating more intense work schedules 
associated with a unit outage.
    During the proposed exemption period, personnel as described in 
10 CFR 26.4(a)(1) through (a)(5) would be permitted to work in 
accordance with the outage MDO requirements in 10 CFR 26.205(d)(4) 
and (d)(5) for a 60-day period. In its August 12, 2025, submittal, 
the licensee proposed two mitigating actions for the exemption 
period. The first proposed mitigating action is an adequate rest 
interval; the licensee states that during the exemption period, 
individuals will have, at a minimum, the rest breaks specified in 10 
CFR 26.205(d)(2). The second proposed mitigating action is 
assessment for fatigue; the licensee states that the cognizant 
supervisors will assess each assigned supervised employee for 
fatigue and mental alertness during the period with less restrictive 
work hour limitations.
    The NRC staff evaluated the proposed mitigating actions and 
concluded that they were not sufficient to prevent or mitigate 
cumulative fatigue for those individuals specified in 10 CFR 
26.4(a)(1) through (a)(5) during the exemption period for extended 
use of outage work hour controls. By letter dated October 3, 2025 
(ML25280A014), the NRC staff issued a request for confirmatory 
information (RCI) and a request for additional information (RAI) to 
request that the licensee provide an explanation of how the current 
actions will mitigate cumulative fatigue and what other actions will 
be taken to address fatigue during the 60-day outage period and the 
exemption period combined for a total period exceeding 100 days of 
less restrictive work hour limitations.
    In its October 15, 2025, supplement, the licensee submitted 
responses to the RCIs and RAIs confirming that the staff's 
understanding was accurate in response to the RCIs. In response to 
the RAI, the licensee stated that no waivers for hours in excess of 
the outage work hour limits have been required for covered workers. 
The licensee also completed an audit of the work hours for the 
affected groups from the beginning of the initial 60-day outage to 
the end of the outage period. The licensee found that personnel 
completing duties that fall under Operations (a)(1) and Fire Brigade 
(a)(3) maintained a schedule pursuant to the non-outage work hour 
controls until the transition to outage work hour controls. 
Individuals completing duties that fall under Health Physics (a)(2) 
and Maintenance (a)(4) maintained a schedule pursuant to 10 CFR 
26.205(d)(4) and average fewer than the maximum allowable 72 hours 
per week. Furthermore, the licensee submitted a commitment in the 
enclosure to the supplement that states that the licensee will 
ensure individuals performing duties under 10 CFR 26.4(a)(2) and 
(a)(4) work no more than 50 hours per week averaged over a 2-week 
period, between October 20, 2025, and November 2, 2025, prior the 
start date of the proposed exemption to ensure an adequate rest and 
reset period between the end of the outage period and start of the 
exemption period for the affected groups.
    Palisades has been shutdown and in a decommissioning state since 
2022. The NRC staff notes that there are no fatigue management 
requirements for licensees in decommissioning. However, because the 
licensee is planning to restart the plant, the NRC staff submitted 
an RAI asking the licensee to describe the 30-day period prior to 
the start of the outage in order to understand the state of work 
hour controls in place for plant personnel before entering the

[[Page 53395]]

outage on August 25, 2025. In response to the RAI, the licensee 
stated that the following work hour controls were applied at 
Palisades for the 30-day period before August 25, 2025: controls 
equivalent to 10 CFR 26.205(d)(1) and 10 CFR 26.205(d)(2)(i); and 
not to exceed 13 consecutive days of work.
    The NRC staff evaluated the work schedules in conjunction with 
the information provided in the supplement and the RAI response. 
Personnel performing duties identified by 10 CFR 26.4(a)(1) and 
(a)(3) have complied with the non-outage work hour controls 
specified in 10 CFR 26.205(d)(7) prior the outage and will continue 
to comply until the start of the proposed exemption period. Because 
these personnel have worked a normal schedule, in accordance with 10 
CFR 26.205(d)(7), leading up to the proposed exemption period, the 
NRC staff determined that administering the minimum days off during 
the 60-day exemption period in conjunction with the rest breaks in 
10 CFR 26.205(d)(2) will allow Palisades to adequately manage 
cumulative fatigue for these personnel.
    Personnel performing duties identified in 10 CFR 26.4(a)(5) have 
worked 12-hour shifts over a 6-week rotational schedule. However, 
these personnel have received at least 4 days off in each successive 
(i.e., non-rolling) 15-day period. In addition, for the 30 days 
prior to the initial 60-day outage, these personnel have worked a 
schedule equivalent to the work hour requirements in 10 CFR 
26.205(d)(1) and 10 CFR 26.205(d)(2)(i). Furthermore, the licensee 
stated in the RAI response that this group averaged less than 54 
hours per week for the 30 days prior the initial outage. Because 
these personnel have worked a normal schedule prior to the outage 
and have received 4 days off in each non-rolling period leading up 
to the end of the outage, the NRC staff determined that 
administering the minimum days off during the 60-day exemption 
period in conjunction with the rest breaks in 10 CFR 26.205(d)(2) 
will allow Palisades to adequately manage cumulative fatigue for 
these personnel.
    Based on the information provided by the licensee, individuals 
performing duties under 10 CFR 26.4(a)(2) and (a)(4) have worked a 
higher than average number of weekly work hours compared to other 
personnel during the initial outage period from August 25, 2025, 
through October 23, 2025. Under 10 CFR 26.4(a)(2), personnel perform 
duties related to Chemistry and Health Physics. Personnel performing 
duties related to Chemistry have worked 8 and 9-hour shifts for 5 
days followed by 2 consecutive days off during the initial outage 
period. Some individuals have worked 12-hour shifts for 4 
consecutive days followed by 3 days off. Personnel performing duties 
related to Health Physics have worked 12-hour shifts for 4 
consecutive days followed by 1 day off. Management has also provided 
additional days off where practicable to support fatigue management 
for this group.
    According to the licensee's RAI response, several different 
positions perform duties under 10 CFR 26.4(a)(4). Seven of twelve 
positions in the table, titled ``Fatigue Management--Group 10 CFR 
26.4(a)(4)'' in response to RAI 1.d, have worked 10-hour shifts on 5 
consecutive days followed by 2 consecutive days off during the 
initial outage period. Three of the twelve positions have worked 12-
hour shifts for 4 consecutive days followed by 3 consecutive days 
off. Two of the positions have worked 12-hour shifts for 6 
consecutive days followed by 1 day off. However, the licensee has 
provided a commitment to provide additional mitigating actions to 
personnel performing duties in both 10 CFR 26.4(a)(2) and (a)(4). 
Per the Enclosure to the RAI response, these individuals will work a 
maximum of 50 hours for the two weeks prior the proposed exemption 
period commencing on November 3, 2025. Based on the work schedules 
provided in the RAI response and the 50-hour limitation over a two 
week period prior to the proposed exemption period, personnel 
covered by 10 CFR 26.4(a)(2) and (a)(4) will receive an adequate 
rest interval of 16.9 hours per day, which is greater than the 
minimum 10-hour break between successive work periods and which 
provides an ample opportunity for personnel to receive a 34-hour 
break in every nine day period.
    The NRC staff determined that the proposed mitigating actions, 
including the MDO requirements and supervisory fatigue assessments, 
in combination with a two-week rest period for individuals in those 
groups who have a higher than the maximum average work hours 
(personnel performing duties in both 10 CFR 26.4(a)(2) and (a)(4)), 
will allow the licensee to adequately manage cumulative fatigue 
during the requested 60-day exemption period. Acute fatigue will be 
managed using the outage MDO requirements combined with fatigue 
assessments by supervisors, which is consistent with common practice 
during unit outages. The NRC staff determined that the proposed 
mitigating actions will adequately manage acute and cumulative 
fatigue. Therefore, the exemption will not endanger life or 
property.

C. The Exemption Will Not Endanger the Common Defense and Security

    The proposed exemption would authorize a one-time exemption from 
the requirements of 10 CFR 26.205(d)(3) and (d)(7) to allow the use 
of the less restrictive work hour controls described in 10 CFR 
26.205(d)(4) and (d)(5) for up to an additional 60-days. The 
proposed exemption is applicable to security personnel who will 
have, at minimum, 4 days off in each successive (i.e., non-rolling) 
15-day period in combination with the minimum rest breaks in 10 CFR 
26.205(d)(2) during the exemption period.
    One additional factor that the licensee included in the October 
15, 2025, supplement and response to the RCIs and RAIs is that 
security personnel will undergo mandated Force-on-Force exercises as 
required by 10 CFR part 73, Appendix B, ``General Criteria for 
Security Personnel'', Section II, ``Training and Qualifications.'' 
While the exercises are not NRC-evaluated, the licensee stated that 
these exercises are mandated security training and will require 
security personnel to work overtime shifts due to staffing 
limitations. In the licensee's response to the RAI, it was stated 
that the individuals performing security duties that fall under 10 
CFR 26.4(a)(5) maintained a schedule pursuant to 10 CFR 26.205(d)(4) 
and averaged under 54 hours per week during the 60 days leading up 
to the proposed exemption period. During the two-week period between 
the end of the initial outage and the start of the proposed 
exemption period, the licensee stated that security personnel will 
maintain an average of 49.26 hours per week. In addition, security 
personnel will continue to receive the breaks described in 10 CFR 
26.205(d)(2)(ii).
    The NRC staff observed that meeting the break requirement in 10 
CFR 26.205(d)(2)(ii) alone is not sufficient to effectively manage 
cumulative fatigue, as this provision is meant to be applied in 
conjunction with the other work hour control measures outlined in 10 
CFR 26.205. However, the NRC staff considered the 34-hour break 
period in conjunction with the fact that, leading up to the 60-day 
exemption period, security personnel will have worked below the 
maximum average of 54 hours per week. In addition, prior to the 
initial 60-day outage period, security personnel will have worked at 
or below 54 hours per week. Because security personnel will have 
worked at or below the maximum average prior to the initial outage 
and will work, on average, 4.74 hours less than the maximum average 
prior to the proposed exemption period, there is added assurance 
that the licensee can adequately manage cumulative fatigue by 
ensuring personnel receive the minimum 34-hour break period prior to 
the proposed 60-day exemption period. The NRC staff determined that 
these mitigating actions in conjunction with the reduction in hours 
worked will prevent cumulative fatigue during the period of the 
exemption. Therefore, the exemption will not endanger the common 
defense and security.

D. The Exemption Is Otherwise in the Public Interest

    The proposed exemption would authorize a one-time exemption from 
the requirements of 10 CFR 26.205(d)(3) and (d)(7) to allow the use 
of the less restrictive work hour controls described in 10 CFR 
26.205(d)(4) and (d)(5) for up to an additional 60 days. In 
considering whether the requested exemptions would be in the public 
interest, the NRC staff considered several factors, including:
    <bullet> the nature of the licensee's unique situation 
transitioning from decommissioning back to a power operations 
licensing basis, which requires restoration of safety-related 
equipment, among other plant restart activities; and
    <bullet> the public health and safety interests of the 
communities that are impacted by the safe restart of the plant.
    The NRC staff considered the fact that Palisades was in 
decommissioning status, but the licensee has determined to restart 
the plant. Palisades has been shut down since May 2022, after which, 
in 2023, the owner at that time, Holtec Decommissioning 
International, determined that they planned to pursue plans to 
restart. This unique situation has required restart-related 
inspections and repair activities during the outage to ensure the 
plant will be safe prior to restarting. The NRC staff also 
considered

[[Page 53396]]

the licensee's efforts to restart the plant utilizing both the 60-
day outage period in combination with the proposed 60-day exemption 
period to meet their proposed sync to grid date.
    The NRC staff considered the balance of public interest 
considerations, including the potential impacts of not granting the 
exemption, which could result in the delay of restarting the 
Palisades Nuclear Plant and could potentially delay the amount of 
energy available to the surrounding area. The NRC staff also 
considered the potential impacts resulting from an increase in 
overall cumulative fatigue due to personnel working longer work 
hours for an additional 60-day period directly following the 
expiration of the initial 60-day outage. Furthermore, the licensee 
has provided adequate mitigating actions through a combination of 
the MDO requirements, supervisory fatigue assessments, and a two-
week rest period for groups of personnel with the highest maximum 
average work hours. The licensee will have adequately managed 
fatigue for personnel identified in 10 CFR 26.4(a)(1) through (a)(5) 
prior to and during the exemption period. Based on these 
considerations, the NRC staff concluded that there are no 
expectations for a significant impact on public health and safety as 
a result of the increase in cumulative fatigue for the 60-day 
exemption period. Therefore, the NRC staff finds that approval of 
the requested exemptions is otherwise in the public interest.

E. Environmental Considerations

    The Commission has determined that granting the proposed one-
time exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 26.205(d)(3) and 
(d)(7) involves (1) no significant hazards consideration, (2) no 
significant change in the types or significant increase in the 
amounts of any effluents that may be released offsite, (3) no 
significant increase in individual or cumulative public or 
occupational radiation exposure, (4) no significant construction 
impact, and (5) no significant increase in the potential for or 
consequences from radiological accidents.
    (1) Under 10 CFR 50.92(c), there is no significant hazards 
consideration if the action does not (1) involve a significant 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident 
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new of 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; 
or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
    The proposed exemption is administrative in nature because it 
provides an additional period when less restrictive hours can be 
worked for personnel identified in 10 CFR 26.4(a)(1) through (a)(5). 
The proposed exemption has no effect on systems, structures, and 
components (SSCs) and no effect on the capability of the SSCs to 
perform their design function. The proposed exemption does not make 
any changes to the facility or operating procedures and does not 
alter the design, function, or operation of any plant equipment. 
Therefore, the exemption does not increase the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
    The proposed exemption does not make any changes to the facility 
or operating procedures and does not alter the design, function, or 
operation of any plant equipment. Similarly, the proposed exemption 
does not authorize any physical changes to any SSCs involved in the 
mitigation of any accidents. Therefore, the exemption does not 
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from 
any accident previously evaluated.
    The proposed exemption does not authorize alteration of the 
design basis or any safety limits for the plant. The exemption would 
not impact station operation or any SSC that is relied upon for 
accident mitigation. Therefore, the exemption does not involve a 
significant reduction in a margin of safety.
    For these reasons, the NRC has determined that approval of the 
exemption requested involves no significant hazards consideration.
    (2) The proposed exemption does not authorize any changes to the 
design basis requirements for the SSCs at Palisades that function to 
limit the release of non-radiological effluents, radiological liquid 
effluents, or radiological gaseous effluents during and following 
postulated accidents. Additionally, the exemption does not change 
any requirements with respect to the conduct of radiation surveys 
and monitoring. Therefore, there is no significant change in the 
types or significant increase in the amounts of any effluents that 
may be released offsite.
    (3) The proposed exemption does not affect the limits on the 
release of any radioactive material or the limits provided in 10 CFR 
part 20, ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation,'' for 
radiation exposure to workers or members of the public. 
Additionally, the exemption will not increase or decrease the amount 
of work activities that must be completed in order to connect the 
reactor unit to the electrical grid. Therefore, there is no 
significant increase in individual or cumulative public or 
occupational radiation exposure.
    (4) The proposed exemption does not involve any changes to a 
construction permit; Therefore, there is no significant construction 
impact.
    (5) The proposed exemption does not alter any of the assumptions 
or limits in the licensee's accident analyses. Therefore, there is 
no significant increase in the potential for or consequences from 
radiological accidents.
    In addition, the requirements from which the exemption are 
sought involve other requirements of an administrative, managerial, 
or organizational nature. Accordingly, the exemption meets the 
eligibility criteria for categorical exclusion set forth in 10 CFR 
51.22(c)(25)(vi)(I). Therefore, in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22(b), 
no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need 
be prepared in connection with the NRC's consideration of the 
exemption request.

IV. Conclusions

    Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 
CFR 26.9, the exemption is authorized by law, will not endanger life 
or property or the common defense and security, and is otherwise in 
the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants 
Palisades Energy, LLC a one-time exemption from 10 CFR 26.205(d)(3) 
and (d)(7) for personnel identified in 10 CFR 26.4(a)(1) through 
(a)(5) to allow the use of the outage MDO requirements described in 
10 CFR 26.205(d)(4) and (d)(5) for a 60-day period starting on 
November 3, 2025. While the exemption is in effect, Palisades 
Energy, LLC will ensure that individuals specified in 10 CFR 
26.4(a)(1) through (a)(3) have at least 3 days off in each 
successive (i.e., non-rolling) 15-day period; that individuals 
specified in 10 CFR 26.4(a)(4) have at least 1 day off in any 7-day 
period; and that individuals specified in 10 CFR 26.4(a)(5) have at 
least 4 days off in each successive (i.e., non-rolling) 15-day 
period. Additionally, Palisades Energy, LLC will use the outage MDO 
requirements, proposed mitigating actions, and the two-week rest 
period between the end of the initial outage and start of the 
exemption period to adequately manage acute and cumulative fatigue 
for covered personnel during the exemption period. If Palisades 
Nuclear Plant is connected to the electrical grid prior to the end 
of the approved 60-day exemption period, the supporting bases for 
this exemption are no longer met. Accordingly, the exemption shall 
end either at the end of the approved 60-day period or at the time 
when the Palisades Nuclear Plant is connected to the electrical 
grid, whichever occurs first.
