I. What is being addressed in this document?

    The EPA is approving a SIP revision submitted by the State of 
Montana to the EPA on August 10, 2022, addressing the requirements of 
the second implementation period of the RHR. As required by section 
169A of the CAA, the RHR calls for state and federal agencies to work 
together to improve visibility in 156 national parks and wilderness 
areas. The rule requires the states, in coordination with the EPA, the 
National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, the Forest Service, 
and other interested parties, to develop and implement air quality 
protection plans to reduce the pollution that causes visibility 
impairment in mandatory Class I Federal areas. Visibility impairing 
pollutants include fine and coarse particulate matter (PM) (e.g., 
sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, elemental carbon, and soil dust) 
and their precursors (e.g., sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), oxides of 
nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>), and, in some cases, volatile organic 
compounds (VOC) and ammonia (NH<INF>3</INF>)). As discussed in further 
detail in our proposed rule, this document, and the accompanying 
Response to Comments

[[Page 54587]]

(RTC) document, the EPA finds that Montana submitted a regional haze 
SIP that meets all the regional haze requirements for the second 
implementation period. The State's submission, the proposed rule, and 
the RTC document can be found in the docket for this action.

II. Background

    On August 10, 2022, Montana submitted a revision to its SIP to 
address its regional haze obligations for the second implementation 
period (2018-2028). Montana made this revision to satisfy the 
requirements of the CAA's regional haze program pursuant to CAA 
sections 169A and 169B and 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 51.308.
    On September 11, 2025, the EPA proposed to approve Montana's 2022 
SIP submission.\1\ Specifically, the EPA proposed to approve Montana's 
2022 SIP submission as satisfying the requirements of 40 CFR 
51.308(f)(1): calculations of baseline, current, and natural visibility 
conditions, progress to date, and the uniform rate of progress; 40 CFR 
51.308(f)(2): long-term strategy; 40 CFR 51.308(f)(3): reasonable 
progress goals; 40 CFR 51.308(f)(4): reasonably attributable visibility 
impairment; 40 CFR 51.308(f)(5) and 40 CFR 51.308(g): progress report 
requirements; 40 CFR 51.308(f)(6): monitoring strategy and other 
implementation plan requirements; and 40 CFR 51.308(i): Federal Land 
Manager (FLM) consultation. Our public comment period closed on October 
14, 2025.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 90 FR 43958 (September 11, 2025).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The September 11, 2025, proposed rule provided background on the 
requirements of the CAA and RHR, a summary of Montana's regional haze 
SIP submittal and related EPA actions, and the EPA's rationale for its 
proposed action. That background and rationale will not be restated 
here. For the reasons stated in the proposed rule, this document, and 
in the accompanying RTC document, the EPA concludes that Montana's 2022 
SIP submission meets the requirements of the CAA and RHR.

III. Public Comments and EPA Responses

    The public comment period on the proposal closed on October 14, 
2025. During the public comment period, we received 16 comments on our 
proposal: 1 in support and 15 in opposition. The commenters were: 
Conservation Groups,\2\ the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Visibility Union 
(MANEVU),\3\ Cabinet Resource Group,\4\ Talen Montana,\5\ and eight 
individual commenters.\6\ The full text of comments received is 
included in the publicly posted docket associated with this action at

in the docket associated with this action, provides detailed responses 
to all significant comments received.

IV. Final Action

    For the reasons stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, in the 
RTC document, and in this document, we are approving Montana's 2022 SIP 
submission. Specifically, we are approving Montana's 2022 SIP 
submission relating to CAA 169A:
    <bullet> Calculations of baseline, current, and natural visibility 
conditions, progress to date, and uniform rate of progress (40 CFR 
51.308(f)(1));
    <bullet> Long-term strategy (40 CFR 51.308(f)(2));
    <bullet> Reasonable progress goals (40 CFR 51.308(f)(3));
    <bullet> Reasonably attributable visibility impairment (40 CFR 
51.308(f)(4));
    <bullet> Progress report requirements (40 CFR 51.308(f)(5) and 40 
CFR 51.308(g));
    <bullet> Monitoring strategy and other implementation plan 
requirements (40 CFR 51.308(f)(6));
    <bullet> FLM consultation (40 CFR 51.308(i)).
    In addition, we are approving the prong 4 visibility portion of 
Montana's October 1, 2018 Infrastructure SIP submission for the 2015 
ozone NAAQS.

V. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

    Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP 
submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable 
Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in 
reviewing SIP submissions, the EPA's role is to approve state choices, 
provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this 
action merely proposes to approve state law as meeting Federal 
requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those 
imposed by state law. For that reason, this action:
    <bullet> Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' subject to 
review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 
12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 
2011);
    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, 
February 6, 2025) because State Implementation Plan approvals under the 
CAA are exempt from review under Executive Order 12866;
    <bullet> Does not impose an information collection burden under the 
provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);
    <bullet> Is certified as not having a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
    <bullet> Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
uniquely affect small governments, described in the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);
    <bullet> Does not have federalism implications as specified in 
Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);
    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, 
April 23, 1997) because it approves a state program;
    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to 
Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001);
    <bullet> Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the 
National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 
note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent 
with the CAA.
    In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian 
reservation land or in any other area where EPA or an Indian Tribe has 
demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian 
country, the rule does not have Tribal implications and will not impose 
substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law as 
specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).
    This action is subject to the Congressional Review Act (CRA), and 
EPA will submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the 
Comptroller General of the United States. This action is not a ``major 
rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).
    Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review 
of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for 
the appropriate circuit by January 27, 2026. Filing a petition for 
reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect 
the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor 
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may 
be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or 
action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to 
enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).
