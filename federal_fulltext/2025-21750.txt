[Docket No. FMCSA-2020-0062]


Marking of Commercial Motor Vehicles; Application for an 
Exemption From Adirondack Trailways, Pine Hill Trailways, and New York 
Trailways

AGENCY: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), Department 
of Transportation (DOT).

ACTION: Notice of final disposition; renewal of exemption.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 55332]]

SUMMARY: FMCSA announces its decision to renew the exemption granted to 
Adirondack Transit Lines, Inc. (dba Adirondack Trailways), Pine Hill-
Kingston Bus Corp. (dba Pine Hill Trailways), and Passenger Bus Corp. 
(dba New York Trailways), from the commercial motor vehicle (CMV) 
marking requirements under certain circumstances involving exchange, or 
interchange of equipment and/or drivers. FMCSA has analyzed the 
exemption renewal application and the public comment and has determined 
that the exemption, subject to the terms and conditions set forth 
below, is likely to achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or 
greater than, the level that would be achieved in the absence of the 
exemption.

DATES: The exemption is effective November 28, 2025, and expires May 
28, 2030.

II. Legal Basis

    FMCSA has authority under 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b) to grant 
exemptions from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). 
FMCSA must publish a notice of each exemption request in the Federal 
Register (49 CFR 381.315(a)). The Agency must provide the public an 
opportunity to inspect the information relevant to the application, 
including the applicant's safety analysis. The Agency must provide an 
opportunity for public comment on the request.
    The Agency reviews the application, safety analyses, and public 
comments submitted and determines whether granting the exemption would 
likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the 
level that would be achieved absent such exemption, pursuant to the 
standard set forth in 49 U.S.C. 31315(b)(1). The Agency must publish 
its decision in the Federal Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, 
the notice will identify the regulatory provision from which the 
applicant will be exempt, the effective period, and all terms and 
conditions of the exemption (49 CFR 381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption is 
denied, the notice will explain the reason for the denial (49 CFR 
381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may be renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)).

III. Background

Current Regulatory Requirements

    The provisions in 49 CFR 390.21 require that every self-propelled 
CMV subject to the FMCSRs be marked with the legal name or a single 
trade name of the motor carrier operating the CMV, as listed on the 
Form MCSA-1, the URS online application, or the motor carrier 
identification report (Form MCS-150) and submitted in accordance with 
Sec.  390.201 or Sec.  390.19, as appropriate (49 CFR 390.21(b)(1)). 
The marking must also include the identification number issued by FMCSA 
to the motor carrier or intermodal equipment provider, preceded by the 
letters ``USDOT'' (49 CFR 390.21(b)(2)). Under 49 CFR 390.21(b)(3), if 
the name of any person other than the operating carrier appears on the 
CMV, the name of the operating carrier must be followed by the 
information required in 49 CFR 390.21(b)(1) and (b)(2) and be preceded 
by the words ``operated by.''

Applicant's Request

    Adirondack Trailways, Pine Hill Trailways, and New York Trailways' 
application for exemption renewal was described in detail in a Federal 
Register notice published on June 3, 2025, (90 FR 23595) and will not 
be repeated as the facts have not changed.

IV. Public Comments

    The Agency received one comment. The American Bus Association 
supported granting the exemption renewal and said, ``Insisting on 
compliance with the current federal marking requirements would not 
increase their safety performance, but it would create an efficiency 
challenge and add a significant cost to the current operations, 
possibly forcing a reduction in service in the long term.''

V. FMCSA Decision

    FMCSA has evaluated the application from Adirondack Trailways, Pine 
Hill Trailways, and New York Trailways, the single comment filed, and 
the applicants' safety records, and grants the exemption renewal. The 
exemption does not provide relief from a rule that could impact the 
safety performance of the commonly owned companies. The applicants are 
fully responsible for complying with the applicable safety regulations 
(e.g., driver licensing and qualification, controlled substances and 
alcohol testing, inspection repair and maintenance, hours of service, 
etc.). Furthermore, the exemption does not leave Federal or State 
enforcement personnel without the means of identifying the carrier 
responsible for the operation of a vehicle on a given trip, or a means 
of conducting compliance assurance activities. As part of the terms and 
conditions of this exemption, the applicants are required to display 
the name and USDOT number assigned to the owner/lessee of the passenger 
carrier vehicle with information about the responsible motor carrier 
readily available from the driver.
    FMCSA initially granted an exemption to Adirondack Trailways, Pine 
Hill Trailways, and New York Trailways on June 1, 2020. The applicants' 
safety records do not indicate any safety deterioration among any of 
the applicants since the granting of the initial exemption. FMCSA 
concludes that the exemption renewal, subject to the terms and 
conditions set forth in section VI, would likely achieve a level of 
safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be 
achieved absent such exemption, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 
31315(b)(1).

Trailways'' and ``FMCSA-2020-0062'' in the subject line.

VII. Termination

    FMCSA does not believe the motor carriers covered by this exemption 
will experience any deterioration of their safety record. However, the 
exemption will be rescinded if: (1) Adirondack Transit Lines, Inc. (dba 
Adirondack Trailways), Pine Hill-Kingston Bus Corp. (dba Pine Hill 
Trailways), and Passenger Bus Corp. (dba New York Trailways), or the 
motor carriers or drivers operating under the exemption fail to comply 
with the terms and conditions of the exemption; (2) the exemption has 
resulted in a lower level of safety than would be achieved in the 
absence of the exemption; or (3) continuation of the exemption would 
not be consistent with the goals and objects of 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 
31315(b).
