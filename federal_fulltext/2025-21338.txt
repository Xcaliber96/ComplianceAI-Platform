--Evaluate whether the proposed information collection is necessary to 
properly perform ATF's functions, including whether the information 
will have practical utility;
--Evaluate the agency's estimate of the proposed information 
collection's burden for accuracy, including validity of the methodology 
and assumptions used;
--Evaluate whether, and if so, how, the quality, utility, and clarity 
of the collected information can be enhanced; and
--Minimize the information collection's burden on those who are to 
respond, including using appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, 
or other technological collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology, e.g., permitting people to submit electronic 
responses.

    Abstract: Regulations under 27 CFR 555.128 require explosives 
licensees/permittees to transfer required records to the ATF Out-of-
Business Records Center when they discontinue business without a 
successor. The records on licensee/permittee importing, manufacturing, 
shipping, receiving, selling, or otherwise disposing of explosive 
materials aid ATF in conducting investigations into trafficking and 
other criminal misuse of explosives.

Overview of This Information Collection

    1. Type of information collection: revision of a previously 
approved collection.
    2. The title of the form/collection: Explosives Licensee/Permittee 
Out-of-Business Records.
    3. The agency form number, if any, and the applicable component of 
the Department sponsoring the collection: Form number: ATF Form none.
    Component: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; 
U.S. Department of Justice.
    4. Affected public who will be asked or required to respond, as 
well as the obligation to respond: individuals or households, private 
sector for- or not-for-profit institutions. The obligation to respond 
is mandatory per Sec.  555.121.
    5. An estimate of the total number of respondents and the amount of 
time estimated for an average respondent to respond: An estimated 250 
respondents will respond to this collection when they discontinue 
business, and it will take each respondent approximately 30 minutes 
(0.5 hours) to complete their responses.
    6. An estimate of the total annual burden (in hours) associated 
with the collection: The estimated annual public burden associated with 
this collection is 115 total hours, which is equal to 230 (total 
respondents) * 1 (# of responses per respondent) * 0.5 hours (30 
minutes).
    7. An estimate of the total annual cost burden associated with the 
collection, if applicable: Based on records over the past three years, 
most out-of-business records are submitted in electronic form, but some 
licensees/permittees augment with remaining paper records. They submit 
these paper records in a large envelope. ATF estimates that capital 
costs to submit out-of-business records are $1.27 for a large envelope. 
At 230 annual responses, ATF estimates that the capital cost for this 
information collection renewal is $292.

Revisions to This Information Collection

    ATF is revising this information collection, OMB control number 
1140-0102, to reflect a decrease in the number of explosives licensees/
permittees going out of business over the past three years. This change 
has also resulted in a corresponding decrease in public burden hours, 
reducing the number of respondents along with the shipping and mailing 
cost burden. In addition, this renewal includes a monetized value for 
the time burden, based on a new request from OMB, and the title has 
been slightly modified to clarify that it applies to explosives 
licensees/permittees.

Department Clearance Officer; United States Department of Justice; 
Justice Management Division, Enterprise Portfolio Management; Two 
Constitution Square, 145 N Street NE, 4W-218, Washington, DC.
