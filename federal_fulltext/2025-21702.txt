[Docket No. FDA-2025-D-4678]


Q3E Guideline for Extractables and Leachables; International 
Council for Harmonisation; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Notice of availability.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing 
the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled ``Q3E 
Guideline for Extractables and Leachables'' and a draft supporting 
document entitled ``Supporting Documentation: Class 3 Leachable 
Monographs.'' The draft guidance and supporting document were prepared 
under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation of 
Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The 
draft guidance presents a holistic framework and process for the 
assessment and control of extractables and leachables (E&L) for 
pharmaceutical products. The draft guidance builds upon ICH impurity 
guidances on new drug substances (ICH Q3A) and new drug products (ICH 
Q3B), residual solvents (ICH Q3C), and elemental impurities (ICH Q3D), 
as well as DNA reactive (mutagenic) impurities (ICH M7). In addition to 
outlining E&L safety assessment principles, the draft guidance includes 
draft supporting documentation of Class 3 leachable monographs. The 
draft guidance is intended to provide approaches to risk-based 
assessment and control of E&L to ensure patient safety and 
pharmaceutical product quality.

DATES: Submit either electronic or written comments on the draft 
guidance by January 30, 2026 to ensure that the Agency considers your 
comment on this draft guidance before it begins work on the final 
version of the guidance.

ADDRESSES: You may submit comments on any guidance at any time as 
follows:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    FDA is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry 
entitled ``Q3E Guideline for Extractables and Leachables'' and a draft 
supporting document entitled ``Supporting Documentation: Class 3 
Leachable Monographs.'' The draft guidance was prepared under the 
auspices of ICH. ICH seeks to achieve greater regulatory harmonization 
worldwide to ensure that safe, effective, high-quality medicines are 
developed, registered, and maintained in the most resource-efficient 
manner.
    By harmonizing the regulatory requirements in regions around the 
world, ICH guidelines enhance global drug development, improve 
manufacturing standards, and increase the availability of medications. 
For example, ICH guidelines have substantially reduced duplicative 
clinical studies, prevented unnecessary animal studies, standardized 
the reporting of important safety information, and standardized 
marketing application submissions.
    The six Founding Members of the ICH are the FDA; the Pharmaceutical 
Research and Manufacturers of America; the European Commission; the 
European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations; the 
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare; and the Japanese 
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. The Standing Members of the 
ICH Association include Health Canada and Swissmedic. ICH membership 
continues to expand to include other regulatory authorities and 
industry associations from around the world (refer to <a href="https://www.ich.org/">https://www.ich.org/</a>).
    ICH works by engaging global regulatory and industry experts in a 
detailed, science-based, and consensus-driven process that results in 
the development of ICH guidelines. The regulators around the world are 
committed to consistently adopting these consensus-based guidelines, 
realizing the benefits for patients and for industry.
    As a Founding Regulatory Member of ICH, FDA plays a major role in 
the development of each of the ICH guidelines, which FDA then adopts 
and issues as guidance for industry. FDA's guidance documents do not 
establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, they describe 
the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as 
recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements 
are cited.
    In August 2025, the ICH Assembly endorsed the draft guideline 
entitled ``Q3E Guideline for Extractables and Leachables'' and agreed 
that the guideline should be made available for public comment. The 
draft guideline is the product of the Quality Expert Working Group of 
the ICH. Comments about this draft will be considered by FDA and the 
Quality Expert Working Group.
    The draft guidance provides a holistic and risk-based framework for 
the assessment and control of E&L in pharmaceutical products, expanding 
upon existing ICH impurity guidelines. The draft guidance discusses 
thresholds for identifying, quantifying, and reporting E&L. The draft 
guidance includes draft Class 3 leachable monographs in its supporting 
documentation.
    This draft guidance has been left in the original ICH format. The 
final guidance will be reformatted and edited to conform with FDA's 
good guidance practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115) and style before 
publication. The draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the 
current thinking of FDA on ``Q3E Guideline for Extractables and 
Leachables.'' It does not establish any rights for any person and is 
not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach 
if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and 
regulations.
    As we develop final guidance on this topic, FDA will consider 
comments on costs or cost savings the guidance may generate, relevant 
for Executive Order 14192.

II. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995

    While this guidance contains no collection of information, it does 
refer to previously approved FDA collections of information. The 
previously approved collections of information are subject to review by 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521). The collections of information 
in 21 CFR part 58 relating to good laboratory practice have been 
approved under OMB control number 0910-0119. The collections of 
information in 21 CFR parts 210 and 211 relating to current good 
manufacturing practice in the manufacture, processing, packing and 
storage of finished pharmaceuticals have been approved under OMB 
control number 0910-0139. The collections of information in 21 CFR part 
314 relating to the submission of new drug applications have been 
approved under OMB control 0910-0001. The collections of information in 
21 CFR part 601 relating to the submission of biological license 
applications have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0338.
