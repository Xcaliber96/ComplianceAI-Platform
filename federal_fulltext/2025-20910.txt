14 CFR Part 39

[Docket No. FAA-2025-0340; Project Identifier MCAI-2024-00462-T; 
Amendment 39-23158; AD 2025-20-05]
RIN 2120-AA64


Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-14-
09, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 
airplanes. AD 2023-14-09 required an inspection for missing or 
incorrectly applied sealant in the wing tanks, applicable corrective 
actions, and a modification to restore two independent layers of 
lightning strike protection. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-14-09, Airbus 
provided inspection instructions for a new inspection area of the upper 
and lower, front and rear spar corner fittings for certain airplanes. 
This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2023-14-09, and requires 
a one-time detailed inspection (DET) for missing or incorrectly applied 
sealant of the front and rear spars for certain airplanes and 
applicable corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address 
the unsafe condition on these products.

DATES: This AD is effective December 30, 2025.
    The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by 
reference of certain publications listed in this AD as of December 30, 
2025.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 
CFR part 39 to supersede AD 2023-14-09, Amendment 39-22509 (88 FR 
51227, August 3, 2023) (AD 2023-14-09). AD 2023-14-09 applied to 
certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2023-14-09 
required an inspection for missing or incorrectly applied sealant in 
the wing tanks, applicable corrective actions, and a modification to 
restore the two independent layers of lightning strike protection. AD 
2023-14-09 corresponds to EASA AD 2022-0250, dated December 14, 2022 
(EASA AD 2022-0250). The FAA issued AD 2023-14-09 to address missing or 
incorrect application of the lightning strike edge glow sealant 
protection at specific locations on the wing tanks. This sealant 
provides the second layer or protection to prevent stringer edge glow 
in case of lightning strike.
    The NPRM was published in the Federal Register on March 11, 2025 
(90 FR 11683). The NPRM was prompted by AD 2024-0155, dated August 13, 
2024, issued by EASA, which is the Technical Agent for the Member 
States of the European Union (EASA AD 2024-0155) (also referred to as 
the MCAI). The MCAI states that since EASA AD 2022-0250 was issued, 
Airbus published inspection instructions for a new one-time DET for 
missing or incorrect application of the lightning strike edge glow 
sealant protection of the affected upper and lower front and rear spar 
corner fittings between Rib 1 and Rib 2 for certain airplanes (i.e., an 
additional affected area not identified in EASA AD 2022-0250), and 
depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions. 
Missing or incorrectly applied sealant, combined with a pre-existing 
undetected incorrect installation of an adjacent fastener, if not 
detected and corrected, could create an ignition source for the fuel 
vapor inside the tanks, which, in case of a lightning strike of high 
intensity in the immediate area, could possibly result in ignition of 
the fuel-air mixture in the affected fuel tank and consequent loss of 
the airplane.
    In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to continue to require the actions in 
AD 2023-14-09 and proposed to require a one-time DET for missing or 
incorrectly applied sealant of the front and rear spars for certain 
airplanes and applicable corrective actions, as specified in EASA AD 
2024-0155. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition 
on these products.
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2025-0340.

Discussion of Final Airworthiness Directive

Comments

    The FAA received comments from the Air Line Pilots Association, 
International, (ALPA) and ProTech Aero Services Limited (ProTech) who 
supported the NPRM without change.
    The FAA received an additional comment from Delta Air Lines 
(Delta). The following presents the comment received on the NPRM and 
the FAA's response to the comment.

Request for Continue Use of Previously Approved Alternative Methods of 
Compliance (AMOCs)

    Delta requested the FAA grant approval to continue using the 
previously approved AMOC AIR-731-23-00454a, dated November 1, 2023. 
Delta stated that the FAA had approved the stated AMOC, allowing the 
omission of pipe tests if the pipes were not removed during access, for 
AD 2023-14-09. Delta noted this proposed AD retains the requirements of 
AD 2023-14-09.

[[Page 53201]]

    The FAA disagrees with the commenter's request. This AD adds 
additional affected areas for inspection; therefore a new AMOC is 
required or a revision to AMOC AIR-731-23-00454a, dated November 1, 
2023, is required that includes those additional inspection areas. The 
FAA has not changed the AD in this regard.

Conclusion

    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority 
of another country and are approved for operation in the United States. 
Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design 
Authority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant 
data, considered any comments received, and determined that air safety 
requires adopting this AD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing 
this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Except for 
minor editorial changes, this AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. 
None of the changes will increase the economic burden on any operator.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2024-0155, which specifies procedures for 
an inspection for discrepancies (missing or incorrect application of 
the lightning strike edge glow sealant protection) at certain locations 
in the wing tanks, and corrective actions. EASA AD 2024-0155 also 
specifies procedures for sealant application to the lower and/or upper 
rib feet in the wings and an inspection for missing or incorrectly 
applied sealant on the upper and lower, front and rear spar corner 
fittings between Rib 1 and Rib 2 for certain airplanes, and corrective 
actions. Corrective actions include applying sealant in areas where 
sealant was found to be missing or incorrectly applied.
    The FAA also reviewed Airbus Service Bulletin A350-57-P067, dated 
September 17, 2020; Airbus Service Bulletin A350-57-P070, Revision 01, 
dated March 14, 2022; Airbus Service Bulletin A350-57-P072, dated June 
24, 2022; Airbus Service Bulletin A350-57-P073, dated June 24, 2022; 
Airbus Service Bulletin A350-57-P074, dated June 24, 2022; and Airbus 
Service Bulletin A350-57-P091, dated May 30, 2024; which identify 
affected airplanes. These documents are distinct since they apply to 
different airplane configurations.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 36 airplanes of U.S. 
registry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:

                                      Estimated Costs for Required Actions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                 Cost on U.S.
             Action                   Labor cost          Parts cost       Cost per product        operators
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Retained actions from AD 2023-14- Up to 225 work-     Up to $500........  Up to $19,625.....  Up to $706,500.
 09.                               hours x $85 per
                                   hour = $19,125.
New actions.....................  Up to 39 work-      $0................  Up to $3,315......  Up to $119,340.
                                   hours x $85 per
                                   hour = $3,315.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FAA estimates the following costs to do any necessary 
corrective action that would be required based on the results of any 
required actions. The FAA has no way of determining the number of 
aircraft that might need the corrective actions:

                  Estimated Costs of Corrective Actions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Cost per
             Labor cost                     Parts cost          product
------------------------------------------------------------------------
10 work-hours x $85 per hour = $850.  Minimal...............       $850
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    According to the manufacturer, some or all of the costs of this AD 
may be covered under warranty, thereby reducing the cost impact on 
affected operators. The FAA does not control warranty coverage for 
affected operators. As a result, the FAA has included all known costs 
in the cost estimate.

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, 
on the relationship between the national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various 
levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
