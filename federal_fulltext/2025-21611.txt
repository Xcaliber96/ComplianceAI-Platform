SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[OMB Control No. 3235-0273]


Agency Information Collection Activities; Proposed Collection; 
Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17Ad-10

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
proposed collection of information provided for in Rule 17Ad-10 (17 CFR 
240.17Ad-10), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a 
et seq.).
    Rule 17Ad-10 generally requires registered transfer agents to: (1) 
create and maintain current and accurate securityholder records; (2) 
promptly and accurately record all transfers, purchases, redemptions, 
and issuances, and notify their appropriate regulatory agency if they 
are unable to do so; (3) exercise diligent and continuous attention in 
resolving record inaccuracies; (4) disclose to the issuers for whom 
they perform transfer agent functions and to their appropriate 
regulatory agency information regarding record inaccuracies; (5) buy-in 
certain record inaccuracies that result in a physical over issuance of 
securities; and (6) communicate with other transfer agents related to 
the same issuer.
    These requirements assist in the creation and maintenance of 
accurate securityholder records, enhance the ability to research 
errors, and ensure the transfer agent is aware of the number of 
securities that are properly authorized by the issuer, thereby avoiding 
over issuance.
    The rule also has specific recordkeeping requirements. It requires 
registered transfer agents to retain certificate detail that has been 
deleted for six years and keep current an accurate record of the number 
of shares or principal dollar amount of debt securities that the issuer 
has authorized to be outstanding. These mandatory requirements ensure 
accurate securityholder records and assist the Commission and other 
regulatory agencies with monitoring transfer agents and ensuring 
compliance with the rule. This rule does not involve the collection of 
confidential information.
    There are approximately 319 registered transfer agents. We estimate 
that the average number of hours necessary for each transfer agent to 
comply with Rule 17Ad-10 is approximately 80 hours per year (70 hours 
of recordkeeping and 10 hours of third-party disclosure), which 
generates an industry-wide annual burden of approximately 25,520 hours 
(319 registered transfer agents x 80 hours). At an average staff cost 
of $78 per hour, the industry-wide internal labor cost of compliance (a 
monetization of the burden hours) is approximately

[[Page 55226]]

$1,990,560 per year (25,520 hours x $78 per hour).\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ We expect that performance of this function will most likely 
be performed by a general clerk. Based on data from the SIFMA 
Management and Professional Earnings Report, modified in 2025 by 
Commission staff to account for, among other things, inflation, we 
expect that the cost for this position is $78 per hour. 80 hours x 
$78 = $6,240 total aggregate monetized cost per transfer agent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The amount of time any particular transfer agent will devote to 
Rule 17Ad-10 compliance will vary according to the size and scope of 
the transfer agent's business activity. We note, however, that at least 
some of the records, processes, and communications required by Rule 
17Ad-10 would likely be maintained, generated, and used for transfer 
agent business purposes even without the rule.
    In addition, we estimate that each transfer agent will incur an 
annual external cost burden of approximately $24,660 resulting from the 
collection of information--90% of which will be attributable to 
recordkeeping and 10% of which will be attributable to third-party 
disclosure ($22,194 from recordkeeping ($24,660 x 90%) and $2,466 from 
third-party disclosure ($24,660 x 10%)).\2\ Therefore, the total annual 
external cost on the entire transfer agent industry is approximately 
$7,866,540 ($24,660 x 319 registered transfer agents)--$7,079,886 will 
be attributable to recordkeeping ($24,660 x 319 registered transfer 
agents) and $786,654 of which will be attributable to third-party 
disclosure ($2,466 x 319 registered transfer agents). This cost 
primarily reflects ongoing computer operations and maintenance 
associated with generating, maintaining, and disclosing or providing 
certain information required by the rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ We expect that performance of this function will most likely 
be performed by a computer operations department manager. Based on 
data from the SIFMA Management and Professional Earnings Report, 
modified in 2025 by Commission staff to account for, among other 
things, inflation, we expect that the cost for this position is $548 
per hour. 45 hours x $548 = approximately $24,660 total aggregate 
external cost per transfer agent.

    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB Control Number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the SEC, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the SEC's estimate of the burden 
imposed by the proposed collection of information, including the 
validity of the methodology and the assumptions used; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated, 
electronic collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology.

Notice to Austin Gerig, Director/Chief Data Officer, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, c/o Tanya Ruttenberg via email to
