SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background--Regulatory Authorities

    The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as amended, 
establishes a comprehensive system for the regulation of medical 
devices intended for human use. Section 513 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
360c) establishes three classes of devices reflecting the regulatory 
controls needed to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and 
effectiveness. The three classes of devices are class I (general 
controls), class II (special controls), and class III (premarket 
approval).
    Section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act defines the three classes of 
devices. Class I devices are those devices for which the general 
controls of the FD&C Act (controls authorized by or under section 501, 
502, 510, 516, 518, 519, or 520 (21 U.S.C. 351, 352, 360, 360f, 360h, 
360i, or 360j) or any combination of such sections) are sufficient to 
provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device; 
or those devices for which insufficient information exists to determine 
that general controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of 
safety and effectiveness or to establish special controls to provide 
such assurance, but because the devices are not purported or 
represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or 
for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment 
of human health, and do not present a potential unreasonable risk of 
illness or injury, are to be regulated by general controls (section 
513(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act). General controls include, but are not 
limited to, provisions that relate to establishment registration and 
device listing; premarket notification; prohibitions against 
adulteration and misbranding (e.g., labeling that fails to bear 
adequate directions for use); recordkeeping and reporting, including 
adverse event reporting and reporting of corrections and removals 
initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a 
violation of the FD&C Act caused by the device which may present a risk 
to health; and current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. 
These controls apply to all devices unless an exemption applies.
    Class II devices are those devices for which general controls by 
themselves are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety 
and effectiveness, but for which there is sufficient information to 
establish special controls to provide such assurance, including the 
issuance of performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient 
registries, development and dissemination of guidelines,

[[Page 53263]]

recommendations, and other appropriate actions FDA deems necessary to 
provide such assurance (section 513(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act).
    Class III devices are those devices for which insufficient 
information exists to determine that general controls and special 
controls would provide a reasonable assurance of safety and 
effectiveness, and are purported or represented to be for a use in 
supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of 
substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or 
present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury (section 
513(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act).
    Devices that were not introduced or delivered for introduction into 
interstate commerce for commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 
(generally referred to as ``postamendments devices'') are classified 
automatically by section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act into class III 
without any action taken by FDA (Agency or we). Those devices remain in 
class III and require approval of a premarket approval application 
(PMA), unless and until: (1) FDA reclassifies the device into class I 
or II, or (2) FDA issues an order finding the device to be 
substantially equivalent, in accordance with section 513(i) of the FD&C 
Act, to a predicate device that does not require premarket approval. 
The Agency determines whether new devices are substantially equivalent 
to predicate devices by means of the premarket notification procedures 
in section 510(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)) and part 807, 
subpart E, of the regulations (21 CFR part 807).
    A postamendments device that has initially been classified into 
class III under section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act may be reclassified 
into class I or class II under section 513(f)(3) of the FD&C Act. 
Section 513(f)(3) of the FD&C Act provides that FDA, acting by 
administrative order, can reclassify the device into class I or class 
II on its own initiative, or in response to a petition from the 
manufacturer or importer of the device. To change the classification of 
the device, the proposed new class must have sufficient regulatory 
controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and 
effectiveness of the device for its intended use.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See generally section 513 of the FD&C Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FDA relies upon ``valid scientific evidence'' as defined in section 
513(a)(3) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 860.7(c)(2) in the classification 
process to determine the level of regulation for devices.\2\ In 
general, to be considered in the reclassification process, the ``valid 
scientific evidence'' upon which the Agency relies must be publicly 
available. Publicly available information excludes trade secret and/or 
confidential commercial information, e.g., the contents of a pending 
PMA (see section 520(c) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360j(c))). Section 
520(h)(4) of the FD&C Act provides that FDA may use, for 
reclassification of a device, certain information in a PMA 6 years 
after the application has been approved. This includes information from 
clinical and preclinical tests or studies that demonstrate the safety 
and effectiveness of the device, but it does not include the 
descriptions of methods of manufacture and product composition and 
other trade secrets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See generally id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In accordance with section 513(f)(3) of the FD&C Act, FDA is 
issuing this proposed order to reclassify postamendments class III 
nucleic acid-based test systems indicated for use with a corresponding 
approved oncology therapeutic product (product codes OWD, PJG, PQP, and 
SFL),\3\ hereafter collectively referred to as oncology therapeutic 
nucleic acid-based test systems, into class II (special controls) 
subject to premarket notification under a new device classification 
regulation with the name ``Nucleic Acid-Based Test Systems for Use with 
a Corresponding Approved Oncology Therapeutic Product.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) uses 
product codes to help categorize and ensure consistent regulation of 
medical devices. A product code consists of three characters that 
are assigned at the time a product code is generated and is unique 
to a product type. The three characters carry no other significance 
and are not an abbreviation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The identification in the proposed classification regulation 
characterizes oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems as 
prescription in vitro diagnostic (IVD) devices intended for the 
detection of specific genetic variant(s) and/or other nucleic acid 
biomarkers in human clinical specimens using nucleic acid amplification 
technology (NAAT) and/or sequencing technology, and are indicated for 
use with a corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product. These 
test systems include companion diagnostic (CDx) test systems, which are 
devices that provide information that is essential for the safe and 
effective use of a corresponding approved therapeutic product and the 
use of which is stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling 
of both the diagnostic device and the approved therapeutic product 
(Ref. 1). These test systems also include those test systems that 
provide information about known benefits and/or risks of an approved 
therapeutic product, where the use of the test system is referenced in 
the product labeling of the corresponding approved therapeutic product 
but the test system is not essential for the safe and effective use of 
the approved therapeutic product.
    As discussed further throughout this proposed order, FDA has issued 
PMAs for various oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems 
designated under product codes OWD, PJG, PQP, or SFL. The oncology 
therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems within the different 
product codes have distinct characteristics in certain respects, for 
example, each product code generally represents devices with a distinct 
technology used (e.g., NAAT and/or sequencing technology) and/or 
specific analyte(s) detected by the test system. FDA has considered the 
distinctions of these test systems across the four product codes and 
has determined that these test systems, including those devices that 
provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of 
a corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product, as well as test 
systems that, while not essential to the safe and effective use of the 
corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product, provide 
information about known benefits and/or risks related to the use of the 
approved oncology therapeutic product, have the same or a similar risk 
profile and sufficiently similar purposes, design considerations, 
functions, and other features related to safety and effectiveness such 
that the same or similar regulatory controls are necessary and 
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and 
effectiveness.\4\ For these reasons and considering that FDA did not 
identify any unique risks associated with the distinctions across

[[Page 53264]]

these devices, FDA is proposing a single classification regulation to 
classify all oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems into 
class II. There would generally not be changes to the product codes 
(i.e., OWD, PJG, PQP, and SFL) for previously approved oncology 
therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems, and future oncology 
therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems would either be assigned to 
one of the currently existing product codes or a new product code, as 
appropriate. The new classification regulation would apply to both 
current and new devices that are oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-
based test systems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ For example, a specific device could be indicated for and 
approved to provide information that is essential for the safe and 
effective use of a corresponding approved oncology therapeutic 
product and to provide information about known benefits and/or risks 
related to the use of a corresponding approved oncology therapeutic 
product that is not essential to the safe and effective use of a 
corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product. The distinction 
is determined by the data from the clinical development program of 
the corresponding therapeutic product and how the therapeutic 
product is labeled (i.e., whether the use of the IVD device is 
essential for the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product 
or not essential for the safe and effective use of the therapeutic 
product but provides information about known benefits and/or risks 
related to the use of the therapeutic product). The devices have 
sufficiently similar purposes, design considerations, functions, and 
other features related to safety and effectiveness such that the 
same or similar regulatory controls are necessary and sufficient to 
provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and the 
devices can be part of the same device type.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Based upon the extensive PMA data available to FDA in accordance 
with section 520(h)(4) of the FD&C Act,<SUP>5 6</SUP> published peer-
reviewed literature studying the longstanding and well-understood 
technologies, and data available to the Agency demonstrating a lack of 
significant postmarket safety signals with oncology therapeutic nucleic 
acid-based test systems, FDA believes there is sufficient information 
to reclassify these devices from class III (premarket approval) into 
class II (special controls). FDA believes the standard in section 
513(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act is met as there is sufficient information 
to establish special controls, which, in addition to general controls, 
would provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of 
these devices.\7\ Therefore, FDA is proposing to establish a new device 
classification regulation, ``Nucleic Acid-Based Test Systems for Use 
with a Corresponding Approved Oncology Therapeutic Product,'' and 
classify this device type into class II along with the special controls 
that the Agency believes are necessary to provide a reasonable 
assurance of the safety and effectiveness for these devices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ In proposing to reclassify oncology therapeutic nucleic 
acid-based test systems from class III to class II, FDA, on its own 
initiative, is relying on data from relevant PMAs and a relevant PMA 
panel-track supplement (under product codes OWD, PJG and PQP) 
available to FDA in accordance with the six-year rule (see section 
520(h)(4) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360j(h)(4)) (see also, FDA, 
``Guidance on Section 216 of the Food and Drug Administration 
Modernization Act of 1997--Guidance for Industry and for FDA 
Reviewers,'' August 9, 2000. Available at <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-section-216-food-and-drug-administration-modernization-act-1997-guidance-industry-and-fda">https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-section-216-food-and-drug-administration-modernization-act-1997-guidance-industry-and-fda</a>). This data was from relevant PMAs and a 
PMA panel-track supplement approved after November 28, 1990 and 
before January 27, 2019 for devices that would fall under this 
specific proposed reclassification as noted in section II of this 
proposed order. See also, FDA's premarket approval database, 
available at <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpma/pma.cfm">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpma/pma.cfm</a>.
    \6\ For the purpose of this proposed order, PMA data considered 
in accordance with section 520(h)(4) includes only that data which 
was submitted to and therefore considered by FDA at the time the PMA 
was reviewed and approval was issued.
    \7\ FDA notes that the ``ACTION'' caption for this proposed 
order is styled as ``Proposed amendment; proposed order; request for 
comments'' rather than ``Proposed order.'' Beginning in December 
2019, this editorial change was made to indicate that the document 
``amends'' the Code of Federal Regulations. The change was made in 
accordance with the Office of the Federal Register's (OFR) 
interpretations of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 15), 
its implementing regulations (1 CFR 5.9 and parts 21 and 22), and 
the Document Drafting Handbook.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under the FD&C Act, premarket notification (510(k)) submissions are 
required to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and 
effectiveness of class II devices unless FDA determines that the device 
type should be exempt from 510(k) requirements under section 510(m) of 
the FD&C Act.\8\ FDA has not made this determination for oncology 
therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems and, therefore, FDA is not 
proposing for this class II device type to be exempt from 510(k) 
requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ In considering whether to exempt class II devices from 
premarket notification, FDA considers whether premarket notification 
for the type of device is necessary to provide reasonable assurance 
of safety and effectiveness of the device. FDA generally considers 
the factors initially identified in the January 21, 1998 Federal 
Register notice (63 FR 3142) and further explained in FDA's guidance 
issued on February 19, 1998, entitled ``Procedures for Class II 
Device Exemptions from Premarket Notification, Guidance for Industry 
and CDRH Staff'' in determining whether premarket notification is 
necessary for class II devices. FDA also considers that, even when 
exempting devices from the 510(k) requirements, these devices would 
still be subject to certain limitations on exemptions, for example, 
the general limitations set forth in 21 CFR 866.9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If this proposed order is finalized, persons who intend to market 
this type of device must submit to FDA a premarket notification under 
section 510(k) of the FD&C Act prior to marketing the device.

II. Regulatory History of the Devices

    In accordance with section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, oncology 
therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems are automatically 
classified into class III because they were not introduced or delivered 
for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution 
before May 28, 1976, have not been reclassified into class I or II, and 
have not been found substantially equivalent to a device placed in 
commercial distribution after May 28, 1976, which was subsequently 
classified or reclassified into class I or class II. Therefore, these 
devices are subject to the PMA requirements under section 515 of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e).
    On August 17, 2011, FDA approved an original PMA for the first 
oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test system, the cobas 4800 
BRAF V600 Mutation Test (P110020) (product code OWD), a real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) IVD device intended for the qualitative 
detection of the BRAF V600E mutation in DNA extracted from human 
melanoma tissue and intended to be used as an aid in selecting melanoma 
patients for treatment with vemurafenib (Ref. 2). In a January 13, 
2012, Federal Register notice (77 FR 2071), FDA announced the approval 
order and availability of the Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data 
(SSED) for the device.
    Subsequently, on December 19, 2014, FDA approved an original PMA 
for the BRACAnalysis CDx under product code PJG (P140020). The 
BRACAnalysis CDx is an oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test 
intended for the qualitative detection and classification of variants 
in the protein coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of the BRCA1 
and BRCA2 genes using genomic DNA obtained from whole blood specimens. 
Single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions (indels) 
are identified by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Large deletions and 
duplications in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are detected using multiplex PCR. 
Results of the test are intended to be used as an aid in identifying 
ovarian cancer patients eligible for treatment with Lynparza (olaparib) 
(Ref. 3). In an April 22, 2015, Federal Register notice (80 FR 22527), 
FDA announced the approval order and availability of the SSED for the 
device.
    FDA subsequently approved an original PMA for FoundationFocus 
CDxBRCA Assay under the product code PQP on December 19, 2016 
(P160018). FoundationFocus CDxBRCA Assay is an oncology therapeutic 
nucleic acid-based test system using next generation sequencing (NGS) 
technology, intended for the qualitative detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 
alterations in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) ovarian tumor 
tissues, with results of the test intended to be used as an aid in 
identifying ovarian cancer patients for whom treatment with Rubraca 
(rucaparib) is being considered (Ref. 4). In a September 25, 2017 
Federal Register notice (82 FR 44626), FDA announced the approval order 
and availability of the SSED for the FoundationFocus CDxBRCA Assay. FDA 
subsequently approved a panel-track supplement \9\ (P160018/S001), on 
April

[[Page 53265]]

6, 2018, expanding the indications for use of this test to include the 
qualitative detection of genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) from FFPE 
ovarian tumor tissue for which positive homologous recombination 
deficiency (HRD) status (defined as tBRCA-positive or LOH high) in 
ovarian cancer patients is associated with improved progression-free 
survival (PFS) from Rubraca (rucaparib) maintenance therapy (Ref. 
5).\10\ This new indication for use, while not essential to the safe 
and effective use of the corresponding approved oncology therapeutic 
product, is to provide information about known benefits related to the 
use of the approved oncology therapeutic product. With the approval of 
P160018/S001, FDA has thus far approved four oncology therapeutic 
nucleic acid-based test systems that provide information about known 
benefits and/or risks of an approved oncology therapeutic product, 
where the use of the test system is referenced in the product labeling 
of the corresponding approved therapeutic product but the test system 
is not considered to be essential for the safe and effective use of the 
approved therapeutic product.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ The term ``panel-track supplement'' is defined in section 
737(4)(B) of the FD&C Act as, ``a supplement to an approved 
premarket application or premarket report under section 515 that 
requests a significant change in design or performance of the 
device, or a new indication for use of the device, and for which 
substantial clinical data are necessary to provide a reasonable 
assurance of safety and effectiveness.''
    \10\ The original device was approved under the trade name 
FoundationFocus CDxBRCA Assay (P160018). The sponsor originally 
submitted the panel-track PMA supplement application (P160018/S001) 
for the same test with an expanded indication for use under the 
trade name FoundationFocus CDxBRCA <INF>HRD</INF>. However, through 
the review process, the sponsor decided to change the name to 
FoundationFocus CDxBRCA <INF>LOH</INF>. Consistent with the 
authorized device trade name for P160018/S001, the name used 
throughout this reclassification proposed order is FoundationFocus 
CDxBRCA <INF>LOH</INF>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, on August 15, 2025, FDA approved an original PMA for the 
Idylla CDx MSI Test under product code SFL (P250005). The Idylla CDx 
MSI Test is an oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test intended 
for the qualitative detection of a panel of seven monomorphic 
biomarkers (ACVR2A, BTBD7, DIDO1, MRE11, RYR3, SEC31A and SULF2) for 
identification of microsatellite instability (MSI) in colorectal cancer 
(CRC) tissue. The Idylla CDx MSI Test uses FFPE tissue sections from 
patients with CRC, from which nucleic acids are extracted and then 
analyzed using PCR amplification and subsequent melt-curve 
analysis.\11\ The Idylla CDx MSI Test reports MSI status as either 
Microsatellite Stable (MSS), Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-H), 
or invalid. The test is intended as a companion diagnostic to identify

OPDIVO (nivolumab) as a monotherapy and/or treatment with OPDIVO 
(nivolumab) in combination with YERVOY (ipilimumab).\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ As noted above, FDA has determined that the tests assigned 
to product codes OWD, PJG, PQP, and SFL all utilize NAAT and/or 
sequencing-based technology for use with a corresponding approved 
oncology therapeutic product, and have sufficiently similar 
purposes, design considerations, functions, and other features 
related to safety and effectiveness such that all oncology 
therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems have the same or a 
similar risk profile. Further, FDA has not identified any unique 
risks associated with the distinctions across these tests.
    \12\ As of the date of issuance of this proposed order, fewer 
than 6 years have transpired since FDA's approval of the Idylla CDx 
MSI Test (PMA P250005). Therefore, no information from this document 
has been used in support of this proposed order to reclassify 
oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems into class II 
(see section 520(h)(4) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360j(h)(4))).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Since the first approval order for an oncology therapeutic nucleic 
acid-based test system, FDA has reviewed and approved an additional 18, 
2, 13, and 1 original PMAs under the product codes OWD, PJG, PQP, and 
SFL, respectively, and approximately 200, 29, 174, and 0 PMA 
supplements, respectively, for therapeutic nucleic acid-based test 
systems under product codes OWD, PJG, PQP, and SFL.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ FDA has determined that the tests assigned to product codes 
OWD, PJG, PQP, and SFL all utilize NAAT and/or sequencing-based 
technology for use with a corresponding approved oncology 
therapeutic product, and have sufficiently similar purposes, design 
considerations, functions, and other features related to safety and 
effectiveness such that all oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based

    In accordance with the ``six-year rule'' described in section 
520(h)(4) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360j(h)(4)) (Ref. 6), FDA 
considered data contained in the following 17 original PMAs and one 
panel-track supplement to an original PMA, representing oncology 
therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems from three of the four 
product codes (i.e., OWD, PJG, and PQP) for oncology therapeutic 
nucleic acid-based test systems: cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test 
(P110020) (product code OWD) (Ref. 2), therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit 
(P110027) (product code OWD) (Ref. 7), therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit 
(P110030) (product code OWD) (Ref. 8), THxID BRAF Kit (P120014) 
(product code OWD) (Ref. 9), cobas EGFR Mutation Test (P120019) 
(product code OWD) (Ref. 10), therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR Kit (P120022) 
(product code OWD) (Ref. 11), BRACAnalysis CDx (P140020) (product code

PQP) (Ref. 19), and Abbott RealTime IDH1 (P170041) (product code OWD) 
(Ref. 20). No information from PMAs and PMA supplements for which fewer 
than six years have passed since FDA's approval has been used in 
support of this proposed order to reclassify oncology therapeutic 
nucleic acid-based test systems into class II (see section 520(h)(4) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360j(h)(4))).\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ In accordance with section 520(h)(4) of the FD&C Act, FDA 
has not relied on information in PMAs and PMA supplements approved 
within the last 6 years to develop the proposed special controls or 
to otherwise inform this proposed reclassification action.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A review of data from FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device 
Experience (MAUDE) database, which contains Medical Device Reports 
(MDRs) of adverse events, indicates that as of September 8, 2025 there 
have been 147 reported events for oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-
based test systems under product codes OWD (N= 139 MDRs), PJG (N= 1 
MDR), PQP (N= 7 MDRs), and SFL (N= 0 MDR) since the approval of the 
first oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test system in 2011.
    After review of the data, the Agency has determined that false 
positive results account for the device problem associated with a 
significant number (over 80 percent) of the MDR reported events. Other 
device problems that were less frequently reported include, for 
example, incorrect, inadequate or imprecise result or readings, non-
reproducible results, output problem, and false negative results. 
Notably, a significant majority (over 95 percent) of the MDRs reported 
under these product codes listed identified no clinical signs, 
symptoms, or conditions; no known impact or consequence to the patient; 
and/or no patient involvement. Other less frequently reported health 
impacts, include, for example, inadequate/

[[Page 53266]]

inappropriate treatment or diagnostic exposure; minor injury/illness/
impairment; and delay to treatment/therapy.
    A search of these product codes in FDA's Medical Device Recalls 
database indicates that as of September 8, 2025, there have been four 
class III recalls, 23 class II recalls,\15\ and no class I recalls \16\ 
involving oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems. Of the 
23 class II recalls, 12 occurred between 2014 and 2022, have since been 
terminated, and were determined to be due to non-specific molecular 
interactions or fluorescence artifacts, nonconforming material/
component, and a process control issue, all of which led to or could 
lead to false positive test results. There is 1 class II recall that 
was terminated on July 19, 2021, for which the manufacturer's reason 
for the recall was potential false positive test results, but the root 
cause is still under investigation by the firm. Other reasons for the 
class II recalls include erroneous translation of the approved English 
labeling to Hungarian, an incorrect or lack of expiration date, and 
erroneous test results caused by off-label use or a manufacturing or 
design issue of the device.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ The database searches initially identified 13 class II 
recalls reported under the product code OWD. However, after manual 
review of the data it has been determined that there is one recall 
that was improperly coded under the product code OWG although the 
product listed should fall within the product code OWD. As such, for 
the purpose of this proposed order the data related to this recall 
has been included in the Agency's postmarket surveillance analysis 
and discussion surrounding recall data.
    \16\ Class I, II, and III recalls are defined in 21 CFR 7.3(m).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Of the four class III recalls, three occurred between 2012 and 
2015, have since been terminated, and were determined to be due to a 
device design issue leading to the device generating invalid results 
and a mix up of materials/components (i.e., incorrect packaging of 
internal-use only components and released for distribution). The 
remaining class III recall was terminated on December 11, 2017, for 
which the manufacturer's reason for the recall was the device 
generating false positive results, however, the root cause is still 
under investigation by the firm.
    This postmarket data, coupled with the relatively low number of 
reported events that caused patient harm, indicate a generally good 
safety record for these device types. The MDR and recall events provide 
information on the risks to health (identified in section V of this 
proposed order), which FDA believes can be effectively mitigated 
through general controls and the special controls proposed herein.
    In response to FDA's announcement that the Agency intended to 
initiate the reclassification process for certain IVDs including 
companion diagnostic tests (Ref. 21), FDA received a petition on July 
25, 2024 from Foundation Medicine Inc., (Docket No. FDA-2024-P-3484) 
requesting FDA to reclassify next-generation sequencing oncology panel 
devices used for somatic or germline variant detection that include one 
or more companion diagnostic indications (under product code PQP) from 
class III to class II. As discussed in this proposed order, FDA has 
considered the information available to the Agency and believes that 
there is sufficient information available to establish special 
controls, and that the special controls proposed in section VII, 
together with general controls, would provide a reasonable assurance of 
the safety and effectiveness of such devices under the PQP product 
code, as well as other similar devices under product codes OWD, PJG and 
SFL, and is proposing, on its own initiative, that oncology therapeutic 
nucleic acid-based test systems, including those under product code 
PQP, be reclassified from class III to class II.

III. Device Description

    Oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems are 
postamendments devices classified into class III under section 
513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. These oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-
based test systems are prescription IVDs intended for the detection of 
specific genetic variant(s) and/or other nucleic acid biomarkers in 
human clinical specimens using NAAT (e.g., PCR) and/or sequencing 
technology (e.g., NGS), and are indicated for use with a corresponding 
approved oncology therapeutic product. These oncology therapeutic 
nucleic acid-based test systems include IVD CDx devices which are 
devices that provide information that is essential for the safe and 
effective use of a corresponding approved therapeutic product.\17\ The 
use of an IVD CDx device with a therapeutic product is stipulated in 
the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device 
and the corresponding approved therapeutic product, including the 
labeling of any generic equivalents of the therapeutic product.\18\ An 
IVD CDx device could be essential for the safe and effective use of a 
corresponding approved therapeutic product to:

Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,'' August 6, 2014.

    <bullet> Identify patients who are most likely to benefit from the 
therapeutic product;
    <bullet> Identify patients likely to be at increased risk for 
serious adverse reactions as a result of treatment with the therapeutic 
product;
    <bullet> Monitor response to treatment with the therapeutic product 
for the purpose of adjusting treatment (e.g., schedule, dose, 
discontinuation) to achieve improved safety or effectiveness;
    <bullet> Identify patients in the population for whom the 
therapeutic product has been adequately studied, and found safe and 
effective, i.e., there is insufficient information about the safety and 
effectiveness of the therapeutic product in any other population.
    FDA does not include in this definition of a CDx device IVD devices 
that are not essential to the safe and effective use of a therapeutic 
product.\19\ For more information on CDx devices, see FDA's guidance 
titled ``In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices--Guidance for Industry 
and Food and Drug Administration Staff'' (Ref. 1).

    \19\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Additionally, the oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test 
systems in this proposed order include IVD test systems that provide 
information about known benefits and/or risks of patient populations 
related to the use of a corresponding approved therapeutic product and 
are referenced in the labeling for the corresponding approved 
therapeutic product but are not essential for the safe and effective 
use of the therapeutic product. For example, such devices can be used 
to assess a biomarker-defined population of patients and provide 
information regarding the overall survival (OS) rate or objective 
response rate for those patients compared to the broader population of 
patients for whom the corresponding therapy is indicated. The use of 
these devices is not a prerequisite for receiving treatment with the 
corresponding therapeutic product but can aid in the benefit-risk 
assessment as to the use of the corresponding therapy for those 
biomarker-defined patients.
    FDA proposes to revise 21 CFR part 866 to create a new device 
classification regulation with the name ``Nucleic Acid-Based Test 
Systems for Use with a Corresponding Approved Oncology Therapeutic 
Product.'' Nucleic acid-based test systems indicated for use with a 
corresponding approved

[[Page 53267]]

oncology therapeutic product are identified as prescription IVD devices 
intended for the detection of specific genetic variant(s) and/or other 
nucleic acid biomarkers in human clinical specimens using NAAT and/or 
sequencing technology to provide information related to the use of a 
corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product. These test systems 
provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of 
a corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product and/or are test 
systems that, while not essential to the safe and effective use of the 
corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product, provide 
information about known benefits and/or risks related to the use of the 
corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product.

IV. Proposed Reclassification and Summary of Reasons for 
Reclassification

    In accordance with section 513(f)(3) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 
part 860, subpart C, FDA is proposing to reclassify oncology 
therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems from class III into class 
II, subject to 510(k) requirements. FDA believes that there is 
sufficient information available to establish special controls, and 
that these special controls, together with general controls, would 
effectively mitigate the risks to health identified in section V and 
are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and 
effectiveness of therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems.
    Under this proposed order, if finalized, oncology therapeutic 
nucleic acid-based test systems will be identified as prescription IVD 
devices. If the proposed order is finalized, these devices will be 
subject to the prescription labeling requirements for IVD products (see 
21 CFR 809.10(a)(4) and (b)(5)(ii)). Section 510(m) of the FD&C Act 
provides that FDA may exempt a class II device from the premarket 
notification requirements under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, if FDA 
determines that premarket notification is not necessary to provide 
reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. For 
oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems, FDA has not made 
this determination and, therefore, the Agency is not proposing to 
exempt these proposed class II devices from 510(k) requirements.\20\ If 
this proposed order is finalized, persons who intend to market an 
oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test system will need to submit 
a 510(k) to FDA and receive clearance prior to marketing the device.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See supra note 8.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This proposed order, if finalized, will decrease regulatory burden 
on industry, as manufacturers will no longer have to submit a PMA for 
these types of devices but can instead submit a 510(k) to the Agency 
for review prior to marketing their device. The 510(k) pathway is less 
burdensome and generally more cost-effective for industry and FDA than 
the PMA pathway, the most stringent type of device marketing pathway. A 
510(k) typically results in a shorter premarket review timeline 
compared to a PMA, which ultimately may provide more timely access of 
these types of devices to patients. FDA expects that the 
reclassification of these devices would enable more manufacturers to 
develop these types of devices such that patients would benefit from 
increased access to appropriately safe and effective tests.
    Additionally, manufacturers may wish to use predetermined change 
control plans (PCCPs) as a way to implement future modifications to 
their devices without needing to submit a new 510(k) for each 
significant change or modification \21\ while continuing to provide a 
reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.\22\ FDA 
reviews a PCCP as part of a marketing submission for a device to ensure 
the continued safety and effectiveness of the device without 
necessitating additional marketing submissions for implementing each 
modification described in the PCCP. When used appropriately, PCCPs 
authorized by FDA are expected to be least burdensome for manufacturers 
and FDA.\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ For the purpose of this proposed order reference to 
``modification'' means a significant change or modification that 
would generally require a new premarket notification under 21 CFR 
807.81(a)(3).
    \22\ Section 3308 of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 
2022, Title III of Division FF of the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2023, Public Law 117-328 (``FDORA''), enacted on December 29, 
2022, added section 515C ``Predetermined Change Control Plans for 
Devices'' to the FD&C Act. Section 515C has provisions regarding 
predetermined change control plans (PCCPs) for devices requiring 
premarket approval or premarket notification. Under section 515C, 
supplemental applications (section 515C(a)) and new premarket 
notifications (section 515C(b)) are not required for a change to a 
device that would otherwise require a premarket approval supplement 
or new premarket notification if the change is consistent with a 
PCCP approved or cleared by FDA.

    FDA believes that there is sufficient information available to FDA 
through the 17 original PMAs and 1 panel-track supplement for cobas

KRAS RGQ PCR Kit (P110027; product code OWD), therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR

7-20), published peer-reviewed literature on nucleic acid-based 
detection methods, including NAAT and sequencing technologies, and 
FDA's publicly available MAUDE and Medical Device Recalls databases to 
establish special controls that effectively mitigate the risks to 
health identified in section V. More specifically, in evaluating these 
data sources, FDA has identified the risks to health for inclusion in 
the overall risk assessment for oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based 
test systems. The Agency has considered the risks to health identified 
by these sources and used certain information from these sources in 
developing proposed special controls that include mitigation measures 
for each of the risks to health identified in section V. Accordingly, 
there would continue to be a reasonable assurance of safety and 
effectiveness for the devices upon their reclassification from class 
III to class II when there is conformity with general and special 
controls. Absent the special controls identified in this proposed 
order, general controls applicable to these devices are insufficient to 
provide

[[Page 53268]]

reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of oncology 
therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ In accordance with section 520(h)(4) of the FD&C Act. FDA 
has not relied on information in PMAs and PMA supplements approved 
within the last 6 years to develop the proposed special controls or 
to otherwise inform this proposed reclassification action.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

V. Risks to Health

    FDA is providing a substantive summary of the valid scientific 
evidence concerning the public health benefits of the use of oncology 
therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems, and the risks to health of 
these devices (see further discussion of the special controls being 
proposed to mitigate these risks in section VII of this proposed 
order). FDA considered data from 17 PMAs and 1 panel-track supplement 
available to FDA under section 520(h)(4) of the FD&C Act, published 
peer-reviewed literature on nucleic acid-based detection methods, 
including NAAT and sequencing technologies, and postmarket information 
regarding oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems.
    Cancer continues to be one of the two leading causes of death in 
the United States (Ref. 22). Biomarker tests for molecularly targeted 
therapies aim to provide information for health care providers to 
target and/or tailor cancer treatment based on identifiable molecular 
differences between patients, with the goal of improving patient 
outcomes while minimizing risks related to treatment side effects. 
Oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems provide a benefit 
to the public health by aiding in oncology therapeutic product 
treatment decisions. These test systems may provide information that is 
essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding approved 
therapeutic product and/or provide information about known benefits 
and/or risks related to the use of a corresponding approved therapeutic 
product that is not essential for its safe and effective use. For 
example, health care providers may use a relevant oncology therapeutic 
nucleic acid-based test system to identify specific patients who are 
eligible for the safe and effective use of a corresponding oncology 
therapeutic product, including those patients for which the drug is 
contraindicated, or monitor a particular patient's response to an 
approved oncology therapeutic product for the purpose of optimizing a 
dosing regimen. These devices can be used to enable personalization of 
oncology care by identifying patients who are most likely to benefit 
from a specific therapy and yield improved clinical outcomes, or who 
are at varying degrees of risk for a particular side effect related to 
the use of a specific therapy. Ultimately, the use of such devices 
informs treatment decisions and has a significant public health impact 
for cancer patients.
    The Agency has identified the following risks to health associated 
with the use of oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems.
    <bullet> False negative test results or false positive test 
results. False negative test results or false positive test results may 
negatively influence oncology therapeutic product treatment decisions 
for patients. For those test systems intended to provide information 
that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding 
approved oncology therapeutic product, this risk may result in the 
withholding of appropriate oncology therapeutic treatment, delayed 
treatment from an available appropriate alternative therapy, or 
receiving inappropriate therapy with varying degrees of consequence 
(e.g., failing to adjust therapy to achieve optimal clinical outcome or 
exposing a patient to otherwise avoidable serious adverse health risks 
caused by the therapeutic product). For those test systems that provide 
information about known benefits and/or risks related to the use of a 
corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product but are not 
essential for the safe and effective use of the corresponding approved 
oncology therapeutic product, this risk may negatively influence 
patient management based on a misinformed benefit-risk assessment 
related to the use of a corresponding oncology therapeutic product and 
could lead to many of the same negative patient outcomes associated 
with test systems intended to provide information that is essential for 
the safe and effective use of a corresponding approved oncology 
therapeutic product as previously described.
    <bullet> Failure of the test system to perform as intended or 
indicated. For test systems intended to provide information that is 
essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding approved 
oncology therapeutic product, failure of the test system to perform as 
intended or indicated may result in inappropriate clinical management, 
due to, among other things, the potential need to rerun the test, 
leading to a delay in effective treatment or inappropriate treatment 
for a patient based on delayed results that are essential for the safe 
and effective use of a corresponding approved oncology therapeutic 
product. Similarly, for those test systems that provide information 
about known benefits and/or risks related to the use of a corresponding 
approved oncology therapeutic product but are not essential for the 
safe and effective use of the corresponding approved oncology 
therapeutic product, this risk may result in the potential need to 
rerun the test, leading to a delay in treatment or inappropriate 
treatment for a patient based on delayed results that would provide 
important benefit-risk information for a health care provider to aid in 
the clinical decision making related to the use of a corresponding 
oncology therapeutic product.
    <bullet> Failure to correctly interpret test results. Failure to 
correctly interpret test results, such as incorrect interpretation of 
the biomarker classification or information provided regarding the 
therapeutic product, may result in the same negative outcomes 
associated with false negative or false positive test results as 
previously discussed. For example, for test systems intended to provide 
information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a 
corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product, incorrectly 
interpreting the test results as positive (i.e., false positive test 
results) may lead to a patient receiving ineffective or unnecessary 
treatment that may unnecessarily expose them to treatment toxicities. 
Similarly, for those test systems that provide information about known 
benefits and/or risks related to the use of a corresponding approved 
oncology therapeutic product but are not essential for the safe and 
effective use of the corresponding approved oncology therapeutic 
product this risk may, for example, lead to inappropriate patient 
management decisions made by a health care provider, such as, selecting 
a suboptimal treatment for a patient, and failure for the patient to 
realize benefit from a different therapy based on inaccurate benefit-
risk information related to the use of a corresponding oncology 
therapeutic product.

VI. Summary of Data Upon Which the Reclassification Is Based

    The safety and effectiveness of this device type has become well 
established since the initial approval of the first oncology 
therapeutic nucleic acid-based test system in 2011. FDA believes that 
oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems should be 
reclassified from class III (premarket approval) into class II (special 
controls) because special controls can be established to mitigate the 
risks to health identified in section V and are necessary, in addition 
to general controls, to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety 
and effectiveness of these devices. The proposed special controls are 
identified by FDA in section VII of this proposed order.
    Taking into account the health benefits of the use of these devices 
and the nature and known incidence of the

[[Page 53269]]

risks to health of the devices, FDA, on its own initiative is proposing 
to reclassify these postamendments class III devices into class II. FDA 
believes, that when used as indicated, oncology therapeutic nucleic 
acid-based test systems can provide significant benefits to health care 
providers and patients.
    In proposing to reclassify and establish special controls for 
oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems, FDA has 
considered and analyzed the following information: (1) data from 17 
PMAs and 1 PMA panel-track supplement for oncology therapeutic nucleic 
acid-based test systems available to FDA in accordance with section 
520(h)(4) of the FD&C Act, (2) published peer-reviewed literature on 
nucleic acid-based detection methods, including NAAT and sequencing 
technologies, and (3) MDR and recall data from the Agency's publicly 
available MAUDE and Medical Device Recalls databases. The available 
evidence demonstrates that there are public health benefits derived 
from the use of oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems 
which provide information related to the use of a corresponding 
approved oncology therapeutic product. In addition, the nature of the 
associated risks to health are known, and special controls can be 
established to sufficiently mitigate these risks.
    FDA considered the safety and effectiveness of oncology therapeutic 
nucleic acid-based test systems through review of PMA data dating back 
to the initial approval of the first oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-
based test system in 2011, under product code OWD (P110020) (Ref. 2). 
Subsequently, between August 17, 2011 and September 8, 2025, FDA 
approved 35 PMAs and 403 supplements for oncology therapeutic nucleic 
acid-based test systems under the product codes OWD, PJG, PQP, and SFL. 
For the purpose of this reclassification, FDA was able to consider data 
from the following 17 original PMAs and 1 panel-track supplement to an 
original PMA in accordance with section 520(h)(4): cobas 4800 BRAF V600 
Mutation Test (P110020), therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit (P110027), 
therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit (P110030), THxID BRAF Kit (P120014), cobas 
EGFR Mutation Test (P120019), therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR Kit (P120022), 
BRACAnalysis CDx (P140020), cobas KRAS Mutation Test (P140023), cobas 
EGFR Mutation Test v2 (P150044), cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 (P150047), 
FoundationFocus CDxBRCA Assay (P160018), FoundationFocus CDxBRCA 
<INF>LOH</INF> (P160018/S001), Praxis Extended RAS Panel (P160038), 
LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay (P160040), Oncomine Dx Target Test 
(P160045), Abbott RealTime IDH2 (P170005), FoundationOne CDx (P170019), 
and Abbott RealTime IDH1 (P170041) (Ref. 2-5, and 7-20).\25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ In accordance with section 520(h)(4) of the FD&C Act. FDA 
has not relied on information in PMAs and PMA supplements approved 
within the last 6 years to develop proposed special controls or to 
otherwise inform this proposed reclassification.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As part of the Agency's analysis for the proposed reclassification 
of oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems, FDA reviewed 
and considered information provided within each of these applications, 
including information available in the SSEDs and device labeling for 
each application, which demonstrated a reasonable assurance of safety 
and effectiveness of the devices. In developing the proposed special 
controls, the Agency considered the analytical and clinical studies and 
device performance data, all of which demonstrated appropriate 
performance of the device and supported each approval. FDA believes the 
proposed special controls can effectively mitigate the risks to health 
identified in section V and, along with general controls, can provide a 
reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness for oncology 
therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems. Additionally, FDA 
identified the probable adverse effects or risks to health of the tests 
based on information provided within the applications. As diagnostic 
tests, oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems generally 
do not pose additional safety hazards or direct adverse effects to the 
patients being tested beyond those associated with routine procedures 
typical for a diagnostic workup of the disease. The risks to health 
identified within the applications include false test results (i.e., 
false negative or false positive test results), failure to correctly 
interpret test results or incorrect test results interpretations, and 
failure of the device to perform as intended or indicated. Based on 
data collected in the clinical and non-clinical studies conducted, the 
safety profile for the devices was generally deemed acceptable in 
supporting the approvals of these devices.
    While the oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems that 
are the subject of the 17 PMAs and 1 PMA panel-track supplement have 
unique test attributes in certain respects (e.g., the use of a specific 
technology and/or the type of analyte(s) detected by the test system), 
FDA has determined that these tests have sufficiently similar purposes, 
design considerations, functions, and other features related to safety 
and effectiveness such that the information and data reviewed and 
analysis conducted by FDA was analogous across all 18 applications 
available to the Agency in accordance with section 520(h)(4) of the 
FD&C Act. As such, and in order to avoid redundancy, the following 
three summaries are intended to provide examples that are 
representative of the PMA information and data that was reviewed and 
considered by FDA across the 18 applications in proposing to reclassify 
oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems from class III 
(premarket approval) into class II (special controls).
    For example, FDA reviewed the original PMA data for the first FDA-
approved oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based test system, which was 
approved on August 17, 2011, through an original PMA (P110020) (product 
code OWD) (Ref. 2), for a CDx test, cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test, 
intended for the qualitative detection of the BRAF V600E mutation in 
DNA extracted from FFPE human melanoma tissues and to be used as an aid 
in selecting melanoma patients whose tumors carry the BRAF V600E 
mutation for treatment with vemurafenib. The Agency considered the 
submitted studies and data provided in the approved submission, which 
demonstrated reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of this 
test when used in accordance with the indications for use. Such studies 
and data include the results of the international, randomized, open-
label, controlled, multicenter, Phase III clinical study N025026 
(BRIM3) for which the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test was used as a 
CDx test for selecting patients for treatment with vemurafenib 
(Zelboraf). Results from this clinical study demonstrated that patients 
who received treatment with vemurafenib (Zelboraf) based on a BRAF 
V600E positive test result as detected by the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 
Mutation Test met the study's two co-primary efficacy endpoints, OS and 
PFS as compared to dacarbazine. Therefore, the results of this clinical 
study helped to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of the safety and 
effectiveness of the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test for its 
indicated use, as an aid in selecting melanoma patients whose tumors 
carry the BRAF V600E mutation for treatment with vemurafenib. The 
performance of the test was also supported by the analytical validation 
studies. For example, reproducibility studies demonstrated very good 
agreement to

[[Page 53270]]

support analytical performance of the test. The adverse effects of the 
test are based on data collected in the BRIM3 clinical study. As a 
diagnostic test, the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test involves 
testing on FFPE human melanoma tissue sections, which are routinely 
removed as part of the diagnosis of melanoma by pathologists. The test, 
therefore, presents no additional safety hazard to the patient being 
tested. Potential adverse effects of the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation 
Test include failure of the device to perform as expected, failure to 
correctly interpret test results, and/or false positive test results or 
false negative test results which may lead to improper patient 
management decisions in melanoma treatment.
    Additionally, FDA considered the original PMA studies and data from 
the Oncomine Dx Target Test PMA, which FDA approved on June 22, 2017 
(P160045) (product code PQP) (Ref.17). The Oncomine Dx Target Test is a 
qualitative test that uses targeted high throughput, parallel-
sequencing technology to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 
deletions in 23 genes from DNA and fusions in ROS1 from RNA isolated 
from FFPE tumor tissue samples from patients with non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) using the Ion PGM Dx System. The test system is 
indicated to aid in selecting NSCLC patients with V600E and EGFR (Ex. 
19del or L858R variant) mutations in DNA, and ROS1 fusions in RNA for 
the targeted therapies of Tafinlar (dabrafenib) in combination with 
Mekinist (trametinib), Xalkori (crizotinib), and Iressa (gefitinib), 
respectively, in accordance with the approved therapeutic product 
labeling. The Agency considered the submitted studies and data in the 
approved submission, which demonstrated reasonable assurance of safety 
and effectiveness of the Oncomine Dx Target Test when used in 
accordance with the indications for use. Such studies and data include 
the retrospective analyses of patients enrolled in two clinical studies 
(BRF113928 for BRAF V600E mutations and A8081001 for ROS1) and safety 
and efficacy data obtained from these trials. The clinical outcomes, 
based on objective response rate (ORR), observed for both clinical 
studies were maintained based on the ORR estimated from the respective 
bridging studies supporting the effectiveness of the Oncomine Dx Target 
Test to select NSCLC patients whose tumors are positive for BRAF V600E 
or ROS1 fusions for treatment with Tafinlar (dabrafenib) in combination 
with Mekinist (trametinib), Xalkori (crizotinib), respectively. The 
safety and effectiveness of the Oncomine Dx Target Test for the 
selection of NSCLC patients with an EGFR (Ex. 19del or L858R variant) 
mutation was demonstrated in a retrospective analysis of concordance 
between the Oncomine Dx Target Test and the FDA-approved QIAGEN 
therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR Kit. Results demonstrating a high concordance 
between the Oncomine Dx Target Test and the QIAGEN therascreen EGFR RGQ 
PCR Kit and comparable reproducibility performance observed between the 
two tests supported the effectiveness of the Oncomine Dx Target Test to 
identify NSCLC patients whose tumors are positive for the EGFR (Ex. 
19del or L858R variant) mutations for treatment with Iressa 
(gefitinib). Further, analytical performance studies were conducted 
with the Oncomine Dx Target Test using DNA and RNA extracted from FFPE 
tissue of NSCLC patients which demonstrated acceptable sensitivity for 
the tested variants when used in accordance with the directions 
provided. The risks of the test or potential adverse effects of the 
test include failure of the device to perform as expected, failure to 
correctly interpret test results, and/or false positive test results or 
false negative test results that could lead to improper patient 
management decisions in NSCLC treatment. Therefore, the clinical and 
analytical data in this application supported the reasonable assurance 
of safety and effectiveness of the Oncomine Dx Target Test when used in 
accordance with the approved indications for use.
    As a final example, FDA considered PMA studies and data from the 
FoundationFocus CDxBRCA <INF>LOH</INF> \26\ panel-track PMA supplement, 
which FDA approved on April 6, 2018 expanding the indications for use 
of this test (P160018/S001) (product code PQP) (Ref. 5) to include an 
indication for use to provide information that while not essential to 
the safe and effective use of a corresponding approved oncology 
therapeutic product, provides information about known benefits and/or 
risks related to the use of an approved oncology therapeutic product. 
FoundationFocus CDxBRCA <INF>LOH</INF> was originally indicated for the 
qualitative detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 alterations in FFPE ovarian 
tumor tissue to aid in identifying ovarian cancer patients with 
deleterious tumor BRCA variants (tBRCA-positive) who may be eligible 
for treatment with Rubraca (rucaparib), providing information that is 
essential for the safe and effective use of Rubraca (rucaparib). The 
panel-track PMA supplement expanded the indications for use to include 
the qualitative detection of genomic LOH from FFPE ovarian tumor tissue 
to determine HRD status (defined as tBRCA-positive and/or LOH high) in 
ovarian cancer patients, and positive HRD status in such patients is 
associated with improved PFS from Rubraca (rucaparib) maintenance 
therapy. This new indication for use is to provide information about 
known benefits related to the use of the approved oncology therapeutic 
product, although the information provided is not essential to the safe 
and effective use of the corresponding approved oncology therapeutic 
product. In accordance with the six-year rule \27\ and to support this 
proposed reclassification action, the Agency considered the submitted 
studies and data in the approved submission, which demonstrated 
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of this test when used 
in accordance with the indications for use. For example, the clinical 
performance of the test for its new indication was established based on 
results from ARIEL3, a Phase 3, global, randomized, double-blind 
clinical study of Rubraca (rucaparib) maintenance therapy demonstrating 
an improved PFS in patients selected by the FoundationFocus CDxBRCA 
<INF>LOH</INF> and a clinical bridging study that included an analysis 
of the concordance of the LOH results between the FoundationFocus 
CDxBRCA LOH and the clinical trial assay (CTA) used in the therapeutic 
product trial. The primary objective of the therapeutic product 
clinical trial was to evaluate PFS by Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The bridging study, which supports 
extrapolating the clinical performance characteristics of the CTA to a 
candidate device (in this case, the FoundationFocus CDxBRCA 
<INF>LOH</INF>)

[[Page 53271]]

to support the clinical validity of the candidate device, includes 
retrospective testing of clinical trial samples using the 
FoundationFocus CDxBRCA <INF>LOH</INF>. To support that the 
FoundationFocus CDxBRCA <INF>LOH</INF> is clinically meaningful and 
provides information about known benefits and/or risks related to the 
use of the approved oncology therapeutic product, the clinical trial 
data were analyzed using a Cox Proportional Hazard model to demonstrate 
that there is an interaction between the test results (HRD status) and 
the corresponding therapeutic product in the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population. The Proportional Hazard model showed a statistically 
significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to Rubraca as 
compared with placebo in all patients, including the biomarker positive 
subgroups (i.e., HRD and tBRCA subgroups). Thus, results demonstrate 
there is overall probable clinical benefit of the FoundationFocus 
CDxBRCA <INF>LOH</INF> for its approved indication for use. However, 
the approved oncology therapeutic product drug is intended for all 
comers, irrespective of biomarker results, therefore, the information 
provided is not essential to the safe and effective use of the 
corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product. Further, the 
performance of the FoundationFocus CDxBRCA <INF>LOH</INF> was also 
supported by analytical validation studies, such as reproducibility and 
repeatability studies, which demonstrated acceptable analytical 
performance of the assay. The risks of the test are based on data 
collected in the validation studies conducted to support the test 
approval. The FoundationFocus CDxBRCA <INF>LOH</INF> involves testing 
on FFPE ovarian cancer tumor tissue. The risks of the test or potential 
adverse effects of the test include failure of the device to perform as 
expected, failure to correctly interpret test results, and/or false 
positive test results or false negative test results which could lead 
to improper patient management decisions in ovarian cancer treatment. 
Therefore, the clinical and analytical data in this panel-track PMA 
supplement supported the reasonable assurance of safety and 
effectiveness of this test when used in accordance with the indications 
for use.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ The original device was approved under the trade name 
FoundationFocus CDxBRCA (P160018). The sponsor originally submitted 
the panel-track PMA supplement application (P160018/S001) for the 
same device with an expanded indication for use under the trade name 
FoundationFocus CDxBRCA <INF>HRD</INF>. However, through the review 
process, the sponsor decided to change the name to FoundationFocus 
CDxBRCA <INF>LOH</INF>. For the purpose of providing example 
summaries that are representative of the PMA information and data 
that was reviewed and considered by FDA to support the proposed 
reclassification action in accordance with the six-year rule (see 
section 520(h)(4) of the FD&C Act), the name used throughout this 
paragraph is FoundationFocus CDxBRCA <INF>LOH</INF>.
    \27\ In accordance with section 520(h)(4) of the FD&C Act, FDA 
has not relied on information in PMAs and PMA supplements approved 
within the last 6 years to develop the proposed special controls or 
to otherwise inform this proposed reclassification action.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition to the original PMA data from the 17 available PMAs and 
one PMA panel-track supplement, FDA further considered that nucleic 
acid-based detection methods, including NAAT and sequencing, are well-
established technologies, for example, with NAAT, such as PCR, first 
described in the 1980s (Ref. 23). These technologies have been commonly 
used in both research and clinical settings for decades and their 
general principles are well understood and widely published in the 
literature at this time (Ref. 24). There have been significant 
scientific developments aimed at addressing certain limitations for 
NAAT and sequencing technologies and expanding the applications of 
these technologies, such as the introduction of a thermostable DNA 
polymerase in PCR and the emergence of high throughput or next 
generation sequencing techniques (Ref. 25-26). These developments 
further demonstrate the maturity of these technologies, and FDA 
considered the breadth of knowledge available regarding NAAT and 
sequencing technologies in proposing to reclassify oncology therapeutic 
nucleic acid-based test systems from class III (premarket approval) 
into class II (special controls). This includes, for example, the 
establishment of special controls that FDA believes can effectively 
mitigate those identified risks to health (discussed in section V) and, 
along with general controls, are necessary to provide a reasonable 
assurance of the safety and effectiveness for these devices.
    Finally, a search of FDA's publicly available MAUDE database 
revealed 147 reported events for oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-
based test systems under product codes OWD, PJG, PQP, and SFL, a 
significant majority of which did not cause patient harm per the 
reports. A search of FDA's publicly available Medical Device Recalls 
database revealed that there have been four class III recall, 23 class 
II recalls, and no class I recalls involving oncology therapeutic 
nucleic acid-based test systems. The lack of class I recalls, and 
relatively few numbers of class II and class III recalls,\28\ coupled 
with the relatively low number of reported events that caused patient 
harm, indicate a generally good safety record for this device type (see 
further discussion of the MDR and recall data in section II of this 
proposed order).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ As defined in 21 CFR 7.3(m), the numerical designation, 
i.e., I, II, or III, assigned by the FDA to a particular product 
recall indicates the relative degree of health hazard presented by 
the product being recalled. Class I recalls are those classified as 
the highest level of risk in which there is a reasonable probability 
that the use of, or exposure to, a violative product will cause 
serious adverse health consequences or death.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Based on the Agency's review of the information described in this 
proposed order, FDA has determined that special controls, in addition 
to general controls, are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of 
safety and effectiveness for these devices, and that sufficient 
information exists to establish such special controls. Therefore, FDA, 
on its own initiative, is proposing to reclassify oncology therapeutic 
nucleic acid-based test systems from class III (premarket approval) 
into class II (special controls) subject to 510(k) requirements.

VII. Proposed Special Controls

    FDA believes that the following proposed special controls would 
mitigate each of the risks to health described in section V and that 
these special controls, in addition to general controls, would provide 
a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for oncology 
therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems.
    Risks of false positive test results or false negative test 
results, failure of the test system to perform as intended or 
indicated, and failure to correctly interpret test results can be 
mitigated by special controls, including certain design verification 
and validation activities. For example, documentation of clinical 
performance testing which must include clinical data demonstrating 
acceptable performance of the device for its intended use based on data 
generated using a dataset representative of the intended use 
population. This may include, for example, data from use of the device 
as the clinical trial enrollment assay in the therapeutic product 
clinical trial or data from a method comparison study to an appropriate 
FDA-authorized device. The analytical performance testing must include 
data demonstrating appropriate analytical performance of the device 
such as the precision, analytical accuracy, analytical sensitivity, 
analytical specificity, and sample and reagent stability of the test 
system. In addition, device design verification and validation 
information must include the specification for risk mitigation elements 
intended to mitigate risks associated with testing and results 
interpretation including, controls, procedures, and user training 
requirements.
    The risks of false test results, failure to correctly interpret 
test results, and failure of the device to perform as intended or 
indicated can be further mitigated by special controls that require 
specific information in the labeling for these test systems. For 
example, a requirement to provide a device description that includes a 
description of relevant limitations with regard to target/genomic 
region(s) that cannot be targeted and/or detected by the test system, 
as applicable. In addition, these risks can be further mitigated by 
labeling special controls that require an appropriate, as

[[Page 53272]]

determined by FDA, summary of the performance studies performed and the 
results of those studies, thus informing the user of the expected 
performance of the device. Table 1 shows how FDA believes such risks to 
health described in section V would be mitigated by the proposed 
special controls.

      Table 1--Risks to Health and Mitigation Measures for Oncology
               Therapeutic Nucleic Acid-Based Test Systems

                                validation data.
                               Certain labeling information, including
                                certain performance information.

                                certain performance information.
Failure to correctly           Certain design verification and
 interpret test results.        validation activities, including certain
                                analytical validation and clinical
                                validation data.
                               Certain labeling information, including
                                certain performance information.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If this proposed order is finalized, oncology therapeutic nucleic 
acid-based test systems will be identified as prescription IVD devices. 
Therefore, these devices would be subject to the prescription labeling 
requirements for IVD products (see 21 CFR 809.10(a)(4) and (b)(5)(ii)).
    If this proposed order is finalized, oncology therapeutic nucleic 
acid-based test systems will be reclassified into class II (special 
controls) and will be subject to premarket notification requirements 
under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act. As discussed in this proposed 
order, the intent is for the reclassification to be codified in the new 
classification regulation 21 CFR 866.6075. If finalized, firms will be 
required to comply with the particular mitigation measures set forth in 
the special controls. Adherence to the special controls, in addition to 
the general controls, is necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of 
the safety and effectiveness of oncology therapeutic nucleic acid-based 
test systems.

VIII. Analysis of Environmental Impact

    We have determined under 21 CFR 25.34(b) that this action is of a 
type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant 
effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental 
assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.

IX. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995

    While this proposed order contains no new collections of 
information, it does refer to previously approved FDA collections of 
information. The previously approved collections of information are 
subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521). The 
collections of information in 21 CFR part 820 (Quality System 
Regulation) have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0073; the 
collections of information in part 807, subpart E (Premarket 
Notification Procedures), have been approved under OMB control number 
0910-0120; and the collections of information in 21 CFR parts 801 and 
809 (Device Labeling) have been approved under OMB control number 0910-
0485.

X. Proposed Effective Date

    FDA proposes that any final order based on this proposal become 
effective 30 days after the date of its publication in the Federal 
Register.

XI. Codification of Orders

    Under section 513(f)(3) of the FD&C Act, FDA may issue final orders 
to reclassify devices. FDA will continue to codify classifications and 
reclassifications in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Changes 
resulting from final orders will appear in the CFR as newly codified 
orders. Therefore, under section 513(f)(3) of the FD&C Act, in the 
proposed order, we are proposing to codify Nucleic Acid-Based Test 
Systems for Use with a Corresponding Approved Oncology Therapeutic 
Product in the new 21 CFR 866.6075, under which these oncology 
therapeutic nucleic acid-based test systems would be reclassified from 
class III into class II.

2. Add Sec.  866.6075 to subpart G to read as follows:


Sec.  866.6075  Nucleic Acid-Based Test Systems for Use with a 
Corresponding Approved Oncology Therapeutic Product.

    (a) Identification. Nucleic acid-based test systems indicated for 
use with a corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product are 
identified as prescription in vitro diagnostic devices intended for the 
detection of specific genetic variant(s) and/or other nucleic acid 
biomarkers in human clinical specimens using nucleic acid amplification 
(e.g., polymerase chain reaction) and/or sequencing technology (e.g., 
next generation sequencing) to provide information related to the use 
of a corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product. These test 
systems include devices that provide information that is essential for 
the safe and effective use of a corresponding approved oncology 
therapeutic product and devices that, while not essential to the safe 
and effective use of the corresponding approved oncology therapeutic 
product, provide information about known benefits and/or risks related 
to the use of the corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product.
    (b) Classification: Class II (special controls). The special 
controls for this device are:
    (1) Design verification and validation must include:
    (i) A summary of the empirical evidence that establishes the 
appropriate analytical quality metrics and thresholds for the test 
system.
    (ii) Device performance data demonstrating appropriate, as 
determined by FDA, analytical and clinical performance of the device 
for the intended use. This must include:
    (A) Data demonstrating the precision, analytical accuracy, 
analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity, and sample and reagent 
stability of the test system. Analytical performance data must be 
evaluated for each gene/variant, or alternatively, justification for an 
alternative approach must be provided and determined by FDA to be 
appropriate, such as the use of a representative set of genes and/or 
variants.
    (B) Data demonstrating all targeted region(s) that can be detected 
by the test system and disclosure of any region(s) not targeted or 
detected by the test system and/or with limited detection by the test 
system, as applicable.
    (C) Clinical data generated using clinical specimens representative 
of the intended use population demonstrating appropriate, as determined 
by FDA, clinical performance of the device for its intended use.
    (D) Data demonstrating appropriate validation of the intended 
specimen handling protocol and specimen preparation (e.g., nucleic acid 
extraction and purification) as described in the labeling.
    (iii) Specifications and data that appropriately demonstrate the 
validity of the biomarker classification process, including any 
bioinformatic pipeline. This information must include a description of 
the classification process, including protocol(s) and criteria used for 
classification and reporting, and detailed documentation of the basis 
for biomarker interpretation with appropriate references.
    (iv) Specification for risk mitigation elements intended to 
mitigate risks associated with testing and results interpretation 
including controls, procedures, and user training requirements, as 
appropriate.
    (2) Labeling must include the following:
    (i) A device description which includes:
    (A) The biomarker(s) detected by the test system;
    (B) Relevant limitations with regard to target/genomic region(s) 
that cannot be targeted or detected by the test system and/or with 
limited detection by the test system, as applicable;
    (C) A description of the analysis algorithms used for biomarker 
detection and annotation, evaluation, and classification;
    (D) A description of the quality metrics, thresholds, and filters 
utilized at each step of the test system, as applicable.
    (ii) An appropriate summary, as determined by FDA, of the 
performance studies conducted and the results of those studies, 
including those that relate to all design verification and validation 
special controls.
    (iii) For those test systems intended to provide information that 
is essential for

[[Page 53274]]

the safe and effective use of a corresponding approved oncology 
therapeutic product, language indicating that the test system is 
indicated for use with a corresponding FDA-approved oncology 
therapeutic product. Device labeling must be consistent with the 
information set forth in the corresponding FDA-approved oncology 
therapeutic product labeling.
    (iv) For those test systems intended to provide information about 
known benefits and/or risks related to the use of a corresponding FDA-
approved oncology therapeutic product but are not essential for the 
safe and effective use of the corresponding approved oncology 
therapeutic product, language summarizing the benefits and/or risks 
related to the use of a corresponding FDA-approved oncology therapeutic 
product that must be consistent with the information set forth in the 
corresponding FDA-approved oncology therapeutic product labeling.
