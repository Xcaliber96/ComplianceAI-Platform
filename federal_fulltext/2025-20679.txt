SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[OMB Control No. 3235-0728]


Agency Information Collection Activities; Proposed Collection; 
Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17ab2-2

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC or ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
proposed collection of information provided for in Rule 17ab2-2 (17 CFR 
240.17ab2-2) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a 
et seq.). The Commission plans to submit this existing collection of 
information to the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for 
extension and approval.
    Exchange Act Rule 17ab2-2 establishes procedures for making 
determinations affecting covered clearing agencies in certain defined 
circumstances. Exchange Act Rule 17ab2-2(a) establishes procedures for 
the Commission to make a determination, either of its own initiative or 
upon application by any clearing agency or member of a clearing agency, 
whether a covered clearing agency is systemically important in multiple 
jurisdictions. Exchange Act

[[Page 53013]]

Rule 17ab2-2(b) establishes procedures to determine, if the Commission 
deems appropriate, whether any of the activities of a clearing agency 
providing central counterparty services, in addition to clearing 
agencies registered with the Commission for the purpose of clearing 
security-based swaps, have a more complex risk profile. Exchange Act 
Rule 17ab2-2(c) provides a procedure for the Commission to determine, 
either of its own initiative or upon application by any clearing agency 
or member of a clearing agency, whether to rescind any such 
determinations previously made by the Commission.
    A clearing agency or one of its members that seeks a determination 
from the Commission under Rule 17ab2- or rescission of any 
determination previously made by the Commission under Rule 17ab2-2 must 
submit an application to the Commission. A respondent would have the 
burden of preparing such application for submission to the Commission. 
The Commission would use the information in the collection to 
facilitate its determination regarding systemic importance in multiple 
jurisdictions or a recission of a determination. It is unlikely that 
confidential information would be included in the collection of 
information, but such information received would be kept confidential 
subject to provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
    Commission staff believes that Rule 17ab2-2 would impose a PRA 
burden on a clearing agency that applies for a determination from the 
Commission under the rule. Commission staff estimate that two 
respondent clearing agencies (or a member of a clearing agency) could 
submit an application for such a determination.
    Commission staff estimates that each respondent clearing agency 
incurs a one-time burden of 10 hours and a one-time cost of $2,190 to 
draft and review a determination request submitted to the Commission, 
for a total of 20 hours and $4,380 for all respondents. The total 
annualized burden and cost for all respondents are 6.66 hours and 
$1,460.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB Control Number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the SEC, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the SEC's estimate of the burden 
imposed by the proposed collection of information, including the 
validity of the methodology and the assumptions used; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated, 
electronic collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology.
    Please direct your written comments on this 60-Day Collection 
Notice to Austin Gerig, Director/Chief Data Officer, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, c/o Tanya Ruttenberg via email to 
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1646776673646179647d4473726375627f79785775625665737538717960"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9eceffeefbece9f1ecf5ccfbfaebfdeaf7f1f0dffdeadeedfbfdb0f9f1e8">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> by January 23, 2026. There will be a 
second opportunity to comment on this SEC request following the Federal 
Register publishing a 30-Day Submission Notice.

    Dated: November 19, 2025.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
