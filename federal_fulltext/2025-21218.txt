21 CFR Part 882

[Docket No. FDA-2025-N-4680]


Medical Devices; Neurological Devices; Classification of Field 
Generator Positioning Device

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Final amendment; final order.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is 
classifying the field generator positioning device into class I 
(general controls). We are taking this action because we have 
determined that classifying the device into class I (general controls) 
will provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the 
device. We believe this action will also enhance patients' access to 
beneficial innovative devices in part by reducing regulatory burdens.

DATES: This order is effective November 26, 2025. The classification 
was applicable on July 10, 2020.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    Upon request, FDA has classified the field generator positioning 
device as class I (general controls), which we have determined will 
provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for its 
intended use. In addition, we believe this action will enhance 
patients' access to beneficial innovation, in part by reducing 
regulatory burdens by placing the device into the appropriate device 
class based on risk and the regulatory controls sufficient to provide 
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
    FDA may classify a device through an accessory classification 
request under section 513(f)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360c(f)(6)), established by section 707 of 
the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (Pub. L. 115-52). The provision 
allows manufacturers or importers to request classification of an 
accessory distinct from another device upon written request. The 
classification is based on the risks of the accessory when used as 
intended as well as the level of regulatory controls necessary to 
provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, 
notwithstanding the classification of any other device with which such 
accessory is intended to be used. Until an accessory is reclassified by 
FDA, the classification of any accessory distinct from another device 
by regulation or written order issued prior to December 13, 2016, will 
continue to apply.
    Under section 513(f)(6)(D)(ii) of the FD&C Act, a manufacturer or 
importer may request appropriate classification of an accessory that 
has been granted marketing authorization as part of a premarket 
approval application (PMA), premarket notification (510(k)), or De Novo 
classification request. FDA must grant or deny the request not later 
than 85 days after receipt and, if granting, publish a notice in the 
Federal Register within 30 days of announcing the classification.
    Alternatively, under section 513(f)(6)(C), a person filing a PMA or 
510(k) may include a written request for the proper classification of 
an accessory that has not been classified distinctly from another 
device based on the risks of the accessory when used as intended and 
the level of regulatory controls necessary to provide a reasonable 
assurance of safety and effectiveness. When the written request is 
included in a submission for marketing authorization, FDA must grant or 
deny the request along with the response to the PMA or 510(k). Upon 
granting, FDA will publish a notice in the Federal Register within 30 
days of announcing the classification.

II. Accessory Classification

    On April 17, 2020, FDA received Stryker ENT's request for accessory 
classification of the TGS Universal Headrest with Mounting Arm. FDA 
reviewed the request in order to classify the device under the criteria 
for classification set forth in section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act.
    We classify devices into class I if general controls are sufficient 
to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the 
device for its intended use (see section 513(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act). 
After review of the information submitted in the request, we determined 
that the device can be classified into class I (general controls). FDA 
has determined that general controls will provide reasonable assurance 
of the safety and effectiveness of the device.
    Therefore, on July 10, 2020, FDA issued an order to the requester 
classifying the device into class I. In this final order, FDA is 
codifying the classification of the device by adding 21 CFR 
882.4565.\1\ We have named the generic type of device ``field generator 
positioning device,'' and it is identified as a manual, mechanical 
device intended to position the field generator of an electromagnetic 
based stereotaxic navigation system in proximity to a patient. The 
device may operate independently or adapt existing medical equipment, 
such as a procedure chair or surgical bed, by using a mechanical 
interface.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ FDA notes that the ACTION caption for this final order is 
styled as ``Final amendment; final order,'' rather than ``Final 
order.'' Beginning in December 2019, this editorial change was made 
to indicate that the document ``amends'' the Code of Federal 
Regulations. The change was made in accordance with the Office of 
Federal Register's (OFR) interpretations of the Federal Register Act 
(44 U.S.C. chapter 15), its implementing regulations (1 CFR 5.9 and 
parts 21 and 22), and the Document Drafting Handbook.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FDA has identified the following risks to health associated 
specifically with this type of device: mechanical failure (which could 
damage the field generator or cause the device to physically impact the 
patient), interference from items within the projected field, or 
movement of the electromagnetic field projection.
    Section 510(l)(1) of the FD&C Act provides that a device within a 
type that has been classified into class I under section 513 of the 
FD&C Act is exempt from premarket notification under section 510(k), 
unless the device is of substantial importance in preventing impairment 
of human health or presents a potentially unreasonable risk of illness 
or injury (21 U.S.C. 360(l)(1)). Devices within this type are exempt 
from the premarket notification requirements under section 510(k), 
subject to the limitations of exemptions in 21 CFR 882.9.

III. Analysis of Environmental Impact

    The Agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.34(b) that this action is 
of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant 
effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental 
assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.

IV. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995

    This final order establishes special controls that refer to 
previously approved collections of information found in other FDA 
regulations and guidance. These collections of information are subject 
to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521). The collections 
of information in 21 CFR part 860, subpart D, regarding De Novo 
classification have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0844; 
the collections of information in the guidance document ``Medical 
Device Accessories--Describing Accessories and Classification 
Pathways'' have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0823; the 
collections of information in part 814, subparts A through E, regarding 
premarket approval have been approved under OMB control number 0910-
0231; the collections of information in 21 CFR part 820 regarding 
quality system regulation have been approved under OMB control number 
0910-0073; the collections of information in part 807, subpart E, 
regarding premarket notification submissions have been approved under 
OMB control number 0910-0120; and the collections of information in 
part 801 regarding labeling have been approved under OMB control number 
0910-0485.

List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 882

    Medical devices.

    Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under 
authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, 21 CFR part 
882 is amended as follows:
