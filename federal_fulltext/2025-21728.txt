SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    Nonprescription drug products are important for the treatment of 
many conditions and diseases. Unlike prescription drug products, 
nonprescription drug products are accessible to consumers without a 
prescription and may be accessed and used safely and effectively by 
consumers without the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to 
administer such drugs for their intended use. At present, the majority 
of nonprescription drug products are intended to provide temporary 
relief of minor symptoms or to treat self-limited conditions and 
diseases. Nonprescription drug products are usually accessible to 
consumers to purchase at pharmacies, supermarkets, or other retail 
locations, and from online retailers.
    FDA approves drugs as either prescription or nonprescription drug 
products under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 355). A drug must be dispensed by prescription 
when it is not safe for use except under the supervision of a 
practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug product because of 
its toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, or the method of 
its use, or the collateral measures necessary to its use (see section 
503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1))).
    If the drug does not meet the criteria for prescription-only 
dispensing, it may be marketed as nonprescription. There are two 
regulatory pathways to bring a nonprescription drug product to market 
in the United States.\1\ This request for information is focused on the 
new drug application (NDA) process under section 505 of the FD&C Act. 
An applicant seeking to market a nonprescription drug under an NDA must 
submit data to satisfy the applicable statutory and regulatory 
requirements for approval of an NDA. Among other things, an NDA must 
include adequate tests to show that the drug is safe for use under the 
conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed 
labeling,\2\ and there must be substantial evidence that the drug will 
have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the 
conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the 
labeling.\3\ Often, consumer studies are required to demonstrate that 
products can be used safely and effectively in a nonprescription 
setting. Label comprehension studies, self-selection studies, actual 
use studies, human factors studies, and other types of studies may be 
required to evaluate proposed nonprescription drug product labeling and 
to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective for use in self-
medication, as directed in proposed labeling as required under 21 CFR 
310.200(b).\4\ The less that is known about the use of a medication 
without the intervention of a health care practitioner, the more data 
that typically will be required.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The two regulatory pathways to bring a nonprescription drug 
product to market in the United States are: (1) the over-the-counter 
(OTC) monograph drug review process under section 505G of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 355h); 
and (2) the application process under section 505 of the FD&C Act.
    \2\ See section 505(d)(l) and (2) of the FD&C Act.
    \3\ See section 505(d)(5) of the FD&C Act.
    \4\ See, for example, the guidance for industry ``Self-Selection 
Studies for Nonprescription Drug Products,'' available at <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/81141/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/81141/download</a>; and the guidance for industry 
``Label Comprehension Studies for Nonprescription Drug Products,'' 
available at <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/75626/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/75626/download</a>.

II. Purpose of Request for Information

    This request for information provides an opportunity for interested 
parties and the public--including commercial drug developers, health 
care providers, consumers, and other relevant groups--to share their 
perspectives with FDA on increasing access to nonprescription drugs. 
Specifically, FDA is interested in perspectives on the scientific, 
regulatory, and practical considerations that shape nonprescription 
drug access. The collected input will help inform

[[Page 55318]]

topics for a public meeting planned for calendar year 2026.

III. Questions for Consideration

    We seek input on the questions presented below. While the questions 
are aimed at gathering information most pertinent to increasing access 
to nonprescription drugs, we welcome any additional data and 
information regarding access to nonprescription drugs that may improve 
our understanding and advance our public health mission. To help FDA 
review comments efficiently, please identify the question to which you 
are responding by its associated category and number. If you are 
responding to more than one question, please identify each question to 
which you are responding, and categorize each response by question.

General

    1. What are challenges faced in the development of drugs for 
nonprescription use?
    2. What are the biggest opportunities to improve access to 
nonprescription drugs?
    3. How could interested parties--including, but not limited to, 
drug developers, health care providers, patients, consumers, and 
retailers--work together to increase access to safe and effective 
nonprescription drugs?
    4. Looking ahead to a 2026 public meeting, what specific topics or 
questions would you like to see on the agenda for public discussion?

Scientific Considerations

    5. What scientific barriers most limit progress in increasing 
access to nonprescription drugs?
    6. What additional scientific tools, technologies, or data sources 
could support access to nonprescription drugs?
    7. Are there specific diseases or conditions that have not, 
traditionally, been treated with nonprescription drugs for which 
nonprescription drugs could be safely and effectively used without the 
supervision of a licensed healthcare practitioner? If so, what 
information would support such use under the applicable statutory and 
regulatory requirements for nonprescription drugs?

Lowell M. Zeta,
Acting Deputy Commissioner for Policy, Legislation, and International 
Affairs.
