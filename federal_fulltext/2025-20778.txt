SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Primary Dealer Meeting Agenda.
    OMB Control Number: 1505-0261.
    Type of Request: Extension without change of a currently approved 
collection.
    Description: The Primary Dealer Meeting Agenda is a quarterly 
survey sent to all primary dealers, which currently comprise 25 
financial institutions. Primary dealers are trading counterparties of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in its implementation of monetary 
policy. Primary dealers are also expected to have a substantial 
presence as a market maker for Treasury securities and to bid on a pro-
rata basis in all Treasury auctions.
    The Treasury's mission to manage the U.S government's finances and 
resources effectively includes financing the government at the lowest 
cost over time. Treasury meets this objective by issuing debt in a 
regular and predictable

pattern, providing transparency in its decision-making process, and 
seeking continuous improvements in the Treasury auction process. 
Unexpected changes in Treasury's borrowing requirements, changes in the 
demand for Treasury securities, and other factors can create risks for 
Treasury. To mitigate these risks, Treasury closely monitors economic 
conditions, market activity, and, if necessary, responds with 
appropriate changes in debt issuance based on analysis and consultation 
with market participants, including the primary dealers through the 
quarterly survey and subsequent meetings.
    Form: None.
    Affected Public: Businesses or other for-profits.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 25.
    Frequency of Response: Quarterly.
    Estimated Total Number of Annual Responses: 100.
    Estimated Time per Response: 2 Hours.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 200.
    Request for Comments: Comments submitted in response to this notice 
will be summarized and included in the request for Office of Management 
and Budget approval. All comments will become a matter of public 
record. Comments are invited on: (a) whether the collection of 
information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of 
the agency, including whether the information shall have practical 
utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the 
collection of information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, 
and clarity of the information to be collected; (d) ways to minimize 
the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including 
through the use of technology; and (e) estimates of capital or start-up 
costs and costs of operation, maintenance, and purchase of services 
required to provide information.
    Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

Rachel Miller,
Executive Secretary.
