SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB)

    Title: Record of Operations--Importer of Tobacco Products or 
Processed Tobacco.
    OMB Control Number: 1513-0106.
    Type of Request: Extension without change of a currently approved 
collection.
    Description: The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) at 26 U.S.C. 5741 
requires all manufacturers and importers of tobacco products, processed 
tobacco, and cigarette papers and tubes, and all export warehouse 
proprietors to keep records as the Secretary of the Treasury prescribes 
by regulation. Under that authority, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and 
Trade Bureau (TTB) regulations in 27 CFR part 41 require importers of 
tobacco products or processed tobacco to maintain the usual and 
customary business showing the receipt and disposition of imported 
tobacco products or processed tobacco. TTB uses the collected 
information to ensure that importers' activities comply with the IRC 
and that processed tobacco, which is not taxed, is not diverted to 
taxable tobacco product manufacturing.
    Form: None.
    Affected Public: Businesses or other for-profits.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 575.
    Frequency of Response: Once annually.
    Estimated Total Number of Annual Responses: 575.
    Estimated Time per Response: None, as this collection is a usual 
and customary business practice, which, per the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) regulations at 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2), imposes no added 
burden on respondents.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: None.
    Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

Spencer W. Clark,
Treasury PRA Clearance Officer.
