send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this 
collection of information, including the necessity and utility of the 
proposed information collection for the proper performance of the 
agency's functions, the accuracy of the estimated burden, ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), federal agencies must obtain approval from 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for each collection of 
information they conduct or sponsor. The term ``collection of 
information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and 
includes agency requests or requirements that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a third party. 
Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)) requires 
federal agencies to publish a 30-day notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed collection of information, including each 
proposed extension or reinstatement of an existing collection of 
information, before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, CMS is publishing this notice that 
summarizes the following proposed collection(s) of information for 
public comment.
    1. Type of Information Collection Request: Revision of a currently 
approved collection; Title of Information Collection: Drug Price 
Negotiation for Initial Price Applicability Year 2028 under Sections 
11001 and 11002 of the Inflation Reduction Act; Use: Under the 
authority in sections 11001 and 11002 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 
2022 (Pub. L. 117-169), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
(CMS) is implementing the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, 
codified in sections 1191 through 1198 of the Social Security Act 
(``the Act''). The Act establishes the Negotiation Program to negotiate 
maximum fair prices (``MFPs''), defined at 1191(c)(3) of the Act, for 
certain high expenditure, single source selected drugs covered under 
Medicare Part B and Part D. For the third cycle of the Negotiation 
Program, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the ``Secretary'') 
will select up to 15 high expenditure, single source drugs payable 
under Part B and/or covered under Part D for negotiation. In accordance 
with section 1194(f)(4) of the Act, CMS will also renegotiate MFPs for 
drugs selected for renegotiation, if any, for initial price 
applicability year 2028.
    Negotiation Data Elements: The statute requires that CMS consider 
certain data from Primary Manufacturers as part of the negotiation 
process. To the extent that more than one entity meets the statutory 
definition of manufacturer (specified in section

[[Page 52956]]

1193(a)(1) of the Act) for a selected drug for purposes of initial 
price applicability year 2028, CMS will designate the entity that holds 
the New Drug Application(s) (NDA(s))/Biologics License Application(s) 
(BLA(s)) for the selected drug to be ``the manufacturer'' of the 
selected drug (hereinafter the ``Primary Manufacturer''). The Primary 
Manufacturer's data submissions include the non-Federal average 
manufacturer price and related data for selected drugs for the purpose 
of establishing a ceiling price, as outlined in section 1193(a)(4)(A) 
of the Act, and information that the Secretary requires for negotiation 
and renegotiation, pertaining to the negotiation factors outlined in 
section 1194(e)(1) of the Act, for the purpose of formulating offers 
and counteroffers pursuant to section 1193(a)(4)(B) of the Act. Some of 
these data are held by the Primary Manufacturer and are not currently 
available to CMS. Data described in sections 1194(e)(1) and 1193(a)(4) 
of the Act must be submitted by the Primary Manufacturer.
    Section 1194(e)(2) of the Act requires CMS to consider certain data 
on selected drugs and their alternative treatments. Because the statute 
does not specify where these data come from, CMS will allow for 
optional submission from Primary Manufacturers and the public for drugs 
selected for negotiation or renegotiation. CMS will additionally review 
existing literature, conduct internal analyses, and consult subject 
matter and clinical experts on the factors listed in section 1194(e)(2) 
of the Act. Manufacturers may optionally submit this information as 
part of their Negotiation Data Elements Information Collection Request 
Form. The public may also optionally submit evidence about the selected 
drugs and their alternative treatments.
    Drug Price Negotiation and Renegotiation Process: Any MFPs that are 
negotiated or renegotiated for these selected drugs will apply 
beginning in initial price applicability year 2028. For initial price 
applicability year 2028, the negotiation and renegotiation period 
begins on the earlier of the date that the Primary Manufacturer enters 
into a Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program Agreement or February 
28, 2026.
    Section 1194(b)(2)(C) of the Act provides that if the Primary 
Manufacturer does not accept CMS' written initial offer, the Primary 
Manufacturer may submit an optional written counteroffer no later than 
30 days after the date of receipt of CMS' written initial offer. If the 
Primary Manufacturer chooses to develop and submit a written 
counteroffer to CMS' written initial offer during the drug price 
negotiation or renegotiation process for initial price applicability 
year 2028, the Primary Manufacturer must submit the Counteroffer Form.
