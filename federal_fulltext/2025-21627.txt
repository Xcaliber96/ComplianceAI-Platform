SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-104260; File No. 10-00248]


In the Matter of the Application of Dream Exchange Holdings, Inc. 
for Registration as a National Securities Exchange; Findings, Opinion, 
and Order of the Commission

November 25, 2025.

I. Introduction and Procedural History

    On February 14, 2025, Dream Exchange Holdings, Inc. (``DreamEx'') 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a 
Form 1 application (``Form 1'') under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (``Act''), seeking registration as a national securities exchange 
under section 6 of the Act.\1\ Notice of the application was published 
for comment in the Federal Register on March 3, 2025.\2\ The Commission 
received no comments on the Form 1. On May 30, 2025, the Commission 
instituted proceedings pursuant to section 19(a)(1)(B) of the Act \3\ 
to determine whether to grant or deny DreamEx's application for 
registration as a national securities exchange under section 6 of the 
Act.\4\ On July 8, 2025, DreamEx filed an amendment to the Form 1 
(``Amendment No. 1'').\5\ Amendment No. 1 was published for comment in 
the Federal Register on July 14, 2025.\6\ On July 16, 2025, DreamEx 
filed Amendment No. 2 to the Form 1 (``Amendment No. 2'').\7\ The 
Commission received no comments on the Form 1, as amended by Amendment 
Nos. 1 and 2. On August 22, 2025, the Commission extended, pursuant to 
section 19(a)(1)(B) of the Act,\8\ the time period for granting or 
denying the Form 1 for an additional 90 days, until November 28, 
2025.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78f. The Form 1 is available on the Commission's 
website at: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/other-commission-orders-notices-information/dream-exchange-form-1">https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/other-commission-orders-notices-information/dream-exchange-form-1</a>. See also 15 U.S.C. 
78s(a)(1) (stating that the Commission shall, ``[w]ithin ninety days 
of the date of publication of such notice (or within such longer 
period as to which the applicant consents),'' grant the registration 
or institute proceedings to determine whether the registration 
should be denied, that any such proceedings ``shall be concluded 
within one hundred eighty days of the date of a public of notice of 
the filing of the application for registration,'' that ``[a]t the 
conclusion of such proceedings, the Commission, by order, shall 
grant or deny such registration,'' and that ``[t]he Commission may 
extend the time for conclusion of such proceedings for up to ninety 
days if it finds good cause for such extension and publishes its 
reasons for so finding or for such longer period as to which the 
applicant consents'').

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission has reviewed DreamEx's registration application, as 
amended, in order to make a determination whether to grant such 
registration. For the reasons set forth below, this order denies 
DreamEx's application, as amended, for registration as a national 
securities exchange.

II. Statutory Standards and Discussion

    Pursuant to Sections 6(b) and 19(a) of the Act,\10\ the Commission 
shall by order grant an application for registration as a national 
securities exchange if the Commission finds, among other things, that 
the proposed exchange is so organized and has the capacity to be able 
to carry out the purposes of the Act and to comply, and to enforce 
compliance by its members, with the provisions of the Act, the rules 
and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the exchange.\11\ The 
Commission shall deny such registration if it does not make such 
finding.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(1) and 15 U.S.C. 78s(a), respectively.
    \11\ See also supra note 1 (discussing the time for Commission 
action following publication of notice of an application for 
exchange registration).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission is mindful of the important role national securities 
exchanges play in the securities markets.\12\ Not only do they operate 
trading markets, but registered national securities exchanges are also 
self-regulatory organizations charged with a public trust to implement 
and enforce the Federal securities laws and rules, as well as their own 
rules with respect to their members.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 40760 (Dec. 8, 
1998), 63 FR 70844, 70881 (Dec. 22, 1998) (``the self-regulatory 
role of registered exchanges is fundamental to the enforcement of 
the Federal securities laws.''); and Securities Exchange Act Release 
No. 50699 (Nov. 18, 2004), 69 FR 71126, 71132 (Dec. 8, 2004) (``As 
operators of trading markets, front-line regulators of securities 
firms, and standard-setters for listed issuers, national securities 
exchanges . . . are critical to the integrity of the U.S. securities 
markets.'').
    \13\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 50699, 69 FR 71126, 
71131.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In connection with DreamEx's application for registration as a 
national securities exchange, the Commission has reviewed information 
provided by DreamEx publicly in its Form 1 and non-publicly in response 
to Commission requests, as well as additional information derived from 
public and non-public sources related to DreamEx and its officers, 
directors, and affiliates.\14\ The non-public information includes 
information obtained as a result of a formal order of investigation 
issued by the Commission to determine whether there have been any 
violations of the Federal securities laws. Although the Commission has 
not yet made any determinations in connection with the investigation, 
taken together, the information currently before the Commission raises 
questions about DreamEx's capacity to be able to carry out the purposes 
of and comply with the provisions of the Act and the rules and 
regulations thereunder that we are not able to resolve at this 
time,\15\ and may not be resolved until the investigation is 
concluded.\16\ Consequently, the Commission is unable at this time to 
find that DreamEx is so organized and has the capacity to be able to 
carry out the purposes of the Act and to comply, and to enforce 
compliance by its members, with the provisions of the Act, the rules 
and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the exchange consistent 
with Section 6(b)(1) of the Act.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ Among other things, there have been press reports raising 
questions about the potential misuse of funds.
    \15\ See 15 U.S.C. 78s(a)(1), supra note 1. However, nothing 
precludes DreamEx from filing another Form 1 application with the 
Commission in the future.
    \16\ The Commission's analysis and conclusions do not depend on 
the identity or affiliation of any such sources. Rather, the 
Commission has considered the substance of the concerns raised both 
publicly and non-publicly in light of the information before it.
    \17\ See supra note 10.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Conclusion

    It is ordered that the application of DreamEx for registration as a 
national securities exchange be, and it hereby is, denied.

    By the Commission.
Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
