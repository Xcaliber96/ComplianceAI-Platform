    Docket. The EPA established a docket for this rulemaking under 
Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0078. All documents in the docket are 
listed at <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a>. Although listed, some 
information is not publicly available, e.g., Confidential Business 
Information (CBI) or other information whose disclosure is restricted 
by statute. The EPA does not place certain other material, such as 
copyrighted material, on the internet; this material is publicly 
available only as PDF versions accessible only on EPA computers in the 
docket office reading room. The public cannot download certain data 
bases and physical items from the docket but may request these items by 
contacting the docket office at 202-566-1744. The docket office has 10 
business days to respond to such requests. With the exception of such 
material, publicly available docket materials are available 
electronically at <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a>.
    Written Comments. Direct your comments to Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-
2025-0078. The EPA's policy is that all comments received will be 
included in the public docket without change and may be made available 
online at <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a>, including any personal 
information provided, unless the comment includes information claimed 
to be CBI or other information for which a statute restricts 
disclosure. Do not submit electronically to <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> 
any information that you consider to be CBI or other information for 
which a statute restricts disclosure. You should submit this type of 
information as discussed below.
    The EPA may publish any comment received to its public docket. A 
written comment must accompany multimedia submissions (audio, video, 
etc.). The EPA considers the written comment to be the official 
comment, and it should include discussion of all points the commenter 
wishes to make. The EPA will generally not consider comments or comment 
contents located outside of the primary submission (i.e., on the web, 
cloud, or other file sharing system). For additional submission 
methods, the full EPA public comment policy, information about CBI or 
multimedia submissions, and general guidance on making effective 
comments, please visit <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets">https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets</a>.
    The <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> website allows you to submit your 
comment anonymously, which means the EPA will not know your identity or 
contact information unless you provide it in the body of your comment. 
If you send an email comment directly to the EPA without going through 
<a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a>, your email address will be automatically 
captured and included as part of the comment that is placed in the 
public docket and made available on the internet. If you submit an 
electronic comment, the EPA recommends that you include your name and 
other contact information in the body of your comment and with any 
digital storage media you submit. If the EPA cannot read your comment 
due to technical difficulties and cannot contact you for clarification, 
the EPA may not be able to consider your comment. Electronic files 
should not include special characters or any form of encryption and 
should be free of any defects or viruses. For additional information 
about the EPA's public docket, visit the EPA Docket Center homepage at 
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/dockets">https://www.epa.gov/dockets</a>.
    Submitting CBI. Do not submit information containing CBI to the EPA 
through <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a>. Clearly mark the part or all of 
the information that you claim to be CBI. For CBI information on any 
digital storage media that you mail to the EPA, note the docket ID, 
mark the outside of the digital storage media as CBI, and identify 
electronically within the digital storage media the specific 
information that is claimed as CBI. In addition to one complete version 
of the comments that includes information claimed as CBI, you must 
submit a copy of the comments that does not contain the information 
claimed as CBI directly to the public docket through the procedures 
outlined in Written Comments section of this document. If you submit 
any digital storage media that does not contain CBI, mark the outside 
of the digital storage media clearly that it does not contain CBI and 
note the docket ID. The public docket and the EPA's electronic public 
docket will include information not marked as CBI without prior notice. 
The EPA will not disclose information marked as CBI except in 
accordance with procedures set forth in 40 Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) part 2.
    Our preferred method to receive CBI is electronic transmittal, 
using email attachments, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or other online 
file sharing services (e.g., Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive). You must 
send electronic submissions directly to the Office of Clean Air 
Programs (OCAP) CBI Office at the email address <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cca3adbdbcbf93afaea58ca9bcade2aba3ba"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="abc4cadadbd8f4c8c9c2ebcedbca85ccc4dd">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, and, 
as described above, you should include clear CBI markings and note the 
docket ID. If you need assistance with submitting large electronic 
files that exceed the file size limit for email attachments, and if you 
do not have your own file sharing service, please email
