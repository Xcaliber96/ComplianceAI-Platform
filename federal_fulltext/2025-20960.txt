SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), 
Federal agencies must obtain approval from the OMB for each collection 
of information that they conduct or sponsor. ``Collection of 
information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) to 
include agency requests or requirements, imposed on ten or more 
persons, that members of the public submit reports, keep records, or 
provide information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of title 44 
generally requires Federal agencies to provide a 60-day notice in the 
Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, 
including each proposed extension of an existing collection of 
information, before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, the OCC is publishing notice of the 
renewal of this collection.
    Title: Extensions of Credit to Insiders and Transactions with 
Affiliates.
    OMB Control No.: 1557-0336.
    Type of Review: Regular.
    Affected Public: Businesses or other for-profit.
    Description: National banks and Federal savings associations must 
comply with rules of the Federal Reserve Board (Board) regarding 
extensions of credit to insiders (Regulation O) \1\ and transactions 
with affiliates (Regulation W),\2\ which implement section 22(h) and 
sections 23A and 23B, respectively, of the Federal Reserve Act 
(FRA).\3\ Twelve CFR part 31.2 requires national banks, Federal savings 
associations, and their insiders to comply with Regulation O, and 12 
CFR 31.3 requires national banks and Federal savings associations to 
comply with Regulation W. A to part 31 provides interpretive guidance 
on the application of Regulation W to deposits between affiliated 
banks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 12 CFR part 215.
    \2\ 12 CFR part 223.
    \3\ 12 U.S.C. 371c, 371c-1, 375a, and 375b. In addition, section 
11 of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1468, includes certain 
restrictions on transactions with affiliates that are not included 
in FRA section 23A.
    \4\ 12 U.S.C. 371c(f)(2)(B)(i).
    \5\ 12 U.S.C. 1468(d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 31.3(c) implements the statutory standards for authorizing 
an exemption from section 23A of the FRA \4\ or section 11 of the Home 
Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) \5\ in accordance with section 608 of the Dodd 
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). 
Section 608, which became effective on July 21, 2012, amends

[[Page 53420]]

section 23A of the FRA and section 11 of the HOLA to authorize the OCC 
to exempt, by order, a transaction of a national bank or Federal 
savings association, respectively, from the affiliate transaction 
requirements of section 23A and section 11 of the HOLA if: (1) the OCC 
and the Board jointly find the exemption to be in the public interest 
and consistent with the purposes of section 23A or section 11, and (2) 
within 60 days of receiving notice of such finding, the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation does not object in writing to the finding. Such 
objection would be based on a determination that the exemption presents 
an unacceptable risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See section 608(a)(4)(A)(iv) of the Dodd-Frank Act 
(exemptive authority for national banks) and section 608(c) of the 
Dodd-Frank Act (exemptive authority for Federal savings 
associations).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 31.3(d) sets forth procedures that a national bank and 
Federal savings association must follow to request such exemptions. 
These procedures are modeled after the Board's procedures in Regulation 
W. A national bank or Federal savings association may request an 
exemption from the requirements of section 23A or section 11 of the 
HOLA, as applicable, and 12 CFR part 223 for a national bank or Federal 
savings association by submitting a written request to the Deputy 
Comptroller for Licensing with a copy to the appropriate Federal 
Reserve Bank. Such a request must:
    (1) Describe in detail the transaction or relationship for which 
the national bank or Federal savings association seeks exemption;
    (2) Explain why the OCC should exemption the transaction or 
relationship;
    (3) Explain how the exemption would be in the public interest and 
consistent with the purposes of section 23A or section 11 of the HOLA, 
as applicable; and
    (4) Explain why the exemption does not present an unacceptable risk 
to the Deposit Insurance Fund.

    Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized

a matter of public record. Comments are invited on:
    (a) Whether the collection of information is necessary for the 
proper performance of the functions of the OCC, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    (b) The accuracy of the OCC's estimate of the burden of the 
collection of information;
    (c) Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
