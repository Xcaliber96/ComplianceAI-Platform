countervailing duty investigation Nos. 701-TA-780-782 and 731-TA-1767-
1769 (Preliminary) pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 to determine 
whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United 
States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or the 
establishment of an industry in the United States is materially 
retarded, by reason of imports of van-type trailers and subassemblies 
from Canada, China, and Mexico, provided for in subheadings 8716.39.00, 
8716.90.50, 7308.30.50, 7308.90.95, 7326.90.86, 8708.29.15, and 
8708.99.81 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that 
are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value and 
alleged to be subsidized by the Governments of Canada, China, and 
Mexico. Unless the Department of Commerce (``Commerce'') extends the 
time for initiation, the Commission must reach a preliminary 
determination in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations in 
45 days, or in this case by January 5, 2026. The Commission's views 
must be transmitted to Commerce within five business days thereafter, 
or by January 12, 2026.
