    Abstract: The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is a federal 
law enforcement agency charged with enforcing the controlled substances 
laws and regulations of the United States. Its principal 
responsibilities include investigation and prosecution of major 
violators of controlled substances laws.
    Because of the nature of DEA's mission, and its status as a law 
enforcement agency, past use of illegal drugs by potential employees 
presents special concerns, and therefore the agency evaluates a job 
applicant's illegal drug use and abuse during the application process. 
Executive Order 12564 is supported in the DEA Pre-Employment Drug 
Policy that a history of illegal drug use or abuse may be a 
disqualification for employment with DEA.
    This amended form notifies job applicants of the DEA Pre-Employment 
Drug Policy and asks them to acknowledge their understanding of those 
requirements to move forward in the employment process.

Overview of This Information Collection

    1. Type of Information Collection: Revision.
    2. The Title of the Form/Collection: Drug Enforcement 
Administration Pre-Employment Drug Policy Notification and 
Acknowledgement.
    3. The agency form number, if any, and the applicable component of 
the Department sponsoring the collection: Form number: DEA-200. The 
sponsoring component is the Drug Enforcement Administration.
    4. Affected public who will be asked or required to respond, as 
well as the obligation to respond: DEA job applicants are asked to 
complete the form. While not mandatory, an applicant can be 
disqualified in the hiring process for failing to provide the requested 
acknowledgement.
    5. An estimate of the total number of respondents and the amount of 
time estimated for an average respondent to respond: The total or 
estimated number of respondents for the DEA-200 is 4727. The time per 
response is 7 minutes.
    6. An estimate of the total annual burden (in hours) associated 
with the collection: The total annual burden hours for this collection
