SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    1. In this Notice of Inquiry, the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (Commission) is inviting comments on whether certain 
activities can be implemented without case-specific authorization from 
the Commission under Part I of the Federal Power Act (FPA) and on what 
changes, if any, the Commission should make to its processes for 
reviewing and authorizing post-licensing activities at hydropower 
facilities, including maintenance, repairs, and upgrades to hydropower 
project infrastructure.

I. Background

A. Statutory Framework

    2. Section 4(e) of the FPA authorizes the Commission to issue 
licenses ``for the purpose of constructing, operating,

[[Page 53311]]

and maintaining dams, water conduits, reservoirs, power houses, 
transmission lines, or other project works necessary or convenient . . 
. for the development, transmission, and utilization of power.'' \1\ In 
issuing these hydroelectric licenses, the Commission is required to 
consider power and development purposes and ``give equal consideration 
to the purposes of energy conservation, the protection, mitigation of 
damage to, and enhancement of, fish and wildlife (including related 
spawning grounds and habitat), the protection of recreational 
opportunities, and the preservation of other aspects of environmental 
quality.'' \2\ After considering power and environmental 
considerations, the Commission will include in a license conditions 
that ensure that the project is best adapted to a comprehensive plan 
for improving or developing a waterway.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 16 U.S.C. 797(e).
    \2\ Id.
    \3\ 16 U.S.C. 803(a)(1). Section 10(a)(1) of the FPA requires 
that any project, for which the Commission issues a license be best 
adapted to a comprehensive plan for improving or developing a 
waterway or waterways for the use or benefit of interstate or 
foreign commerce; for the improvement and use of waterpower 
development; for the adequate protection, mitigation, and 
enhancement of fish and wildlife; and for other beneficial public 
uses, including irrigation, flood control, water supply, recreation, 
and other purposes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. After issuance of a license, projects require ongoing 
maintenance and often require modification during the term of the 
license. With respect to post-licensing activities, section 10(b) of 
the FPA states ``except when emergency shall require for the protection 
of navigation, life, health, or property, no substantial alteration or 
addition not in conformity with the approved plans shall be made to any 
dam or other project works . . . without the prior approval of the 
Commission'' (emphasis added).\4\ Similarly, pursuant to section 
23(b)(1) of the FPA, a licensee may not ``commence any significant 
modification of any [licensed] project . . . unless such modification 
is authorized in accordance with terms and conditions of such license . 
. . and the applicable requirements of [Part I of the FPA]'' (emphasis 
added).\5\ The Commission understands these provisions to allow 
licensees to make alterations that are not ``substantial'' or 
``significant'' without further authorization. Post-licensing 
activities that do not fit within these categories, including some 
maintenance, repairs, and upgrades, require Commission approval before 
implementation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ 16 U.S.C. 803(b). For conditions affecting the safety of a 
project or its works, should emergency modifications be necessary at 
the project, licensees are required to report the incident and 
details of the modification according to certain reporting 
requirements. 18 CFR 12.11 and 18 CFR 12.10(a).
    \5\ 16 U.S.C. 817(2). In order to ensure dam safety, the 
Commission's dam safety regulations also require licensees to report 
modifications of the project or project works to the applicable 
Commission Regional Engineer in writing. 18 CFR 12.11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. Applicants for post-licensing activities must also comply with 
federal laws for the protection of environmental resources, such as the 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),\6\ Endangered Species Act of 
1973, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the Clean Water 
Act.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ On July 23, 2025, the Commission adopted two categorical 
exclusions from the United States Bureau of Reclamation, for 
``[m]aintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement of existing 
facilities which may involve a minor change in size, location, and/
or operation'' and for ``[m]inor safety of dam construction 
activities where the work is confined to the dam, abutment areas, or 
appurtenant features, and where no major change in reservoir or 
downstream operation is anticipated as a result of the construction 
activities.'' See Adopting Categorical Exclusions under the Nat'l 
Env't Pol'y Act, 192 FERC ] 61,019, at P 2 (2025) (first citing 
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. 118-5, 137 Stat. 10 (June 
3, 2023), and then citing 42 U.S.C. 4336c); id. PP 4-5, 10-13, 
ordering para. (A).
    \7\ Other federal statutes, such as the Marine Mammal Protection 
Act, may apply in particular cases.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Commission Regulations for Amendment Applications

    5. Commission regulations require amendment applications when a 
licensee seeks to: make a change in the physical features of the 
project or its boundary, or make an addition, betterment, abandonment, 
or conversion, of such character as to constitute an alteration of the 
license; or make a change in the plans for the project under 
license.\8\ Requirements regarding these applications vary depending on 
whether the application is for a capacity or non-capacity amendment.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ 18 CFR 4.200.
    \9\ A ``capacity related amendment'' is one where the applicant 
seeks ``to amend a license for a hydropower project that involves 
additional capacity not previously authorized, and that would 
increase the actual or proposed total installed capacity of the 
project, would result in an increase in the maximum hydraulic 
capacity of the project of 15 percent or more, and would result in 
an increase in the installed name-plate capacity of 2 megawatts or 
more.'' 18 CFR 4.201(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. Commission regulations require specific information to be 
submitted as part of a capacity-related amendment application.\10\ For 
non-capacity-related amendments, the Commission requires an applicant 
to submit revised versions of any exhibits (such as project maps) that 
require revision in light of the proposed amendment.\11\ Additionally, 
to ensure that state and federal agencies and Indian Tribes have the 
opportunity to discuss the proposal with the applicant, the applicant 
must complete pre-filing consultation requirements for capacity-related 
amendments as well as specified non-capacity-related amendments.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ Id. (specifying required exhibits depending on the type of 
project).
    \11\ 18 CFR 4.201(c).
    \12\ These include amendments that would involve the 
construction of a new dam or diversion in a location where there is 
no existing dam or diversion; any repair, modification, or 
reconstruction of an existing dam that would result in a significant 
change in the normal maximum surface area or elevation of an 
existing impoundment; or the addition of new water power turbines 
other than to replace existing turbines. 18 CFR 4.38(a)(6)(iv)-(v); 
see also 18 CFR 4.38(a)(7).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7. Ensuring the protection of human life, health, and property is a 
key aspect of the Commission's regulation of hydropower projects.\13\ 
Accordingly, the Commission's dam safety regulations set forth the 
authority of Commission staff in inspecting, reviewing, and requiring 
modifications to licensed projects for the purposes of ensuring the 
safety, stability, security, and integrity of the project works.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See 16 U.S.C. 803(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Minor Changes Authorized by License Articles

    8. The Commission includes in every license two articles, Articles 
2 and 3, which give licensees the ability to make minor changes without 
the need to obtain approval from the Commission. Article 2 provides:

    No substantial change shall be made in the maps, plans, 
specifications, and statements described and designated as exhibits 
and approved by the Commission in its order as a part of the license 
until such change shall have been approved by the Commission: 
Provided, however, [t]hat if the Licensee or the Commission deems it 
necessary or desirable that said approved exhibits, or any of them, 
be changed, there shall be submitted to the Commission for approval 
a revised, or additional exhibit or exhibits covering the proposed 
changes which, upon approval by the Commission, shall become a part 
of the license and shall supersede, in whole or in part, such 
exhibit or exhibits theretofore made a part of the license as may be 
specified by the Commission.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ See, e.g., Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Form L-1, 
Article 2 (October 1975).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Article 3 provides:

    The project works shall be constructed in substantial conformity 
with the approved exhibits referred to in Article 2 herein or as 
changed in accordance with the provisions of said article. Except 
when emergency shall require for the protection of navigation, life, 
health, or property, there shall not be made without prior approval 
of the Commission any substantial alteration or addition not in 
conformity with the approved plans to any dam or other project works 
under the license or any substantial use of project lands and

[[Page 53312]]

waters not authorized herein; and any emergency alteration, 
addition, or use so made shall thereafter be subject to such 
modification and change as the Commission may direct. Minor changes 
in project works, or in uses of project lands and waters, or 
divergence from such approved exhibits may be made if such changes 
will not result in a decrease in efficiency, in a material increase 
in cost, in an adverse environmental impact, or in impairment of the 
general scheme of development; but any of such minor changes made 
without the prior approval of the Commission, which in its judgment 
have produced or will produce any of such results, shall be subject 
to such alteration as the Commission may direct.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See, e.g., Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Form L-1, 
Article 3 (October 1975).

    The Commission has explained that, pursuant to Article 3, ``certain 
minor changes in the specifications approved in the license can be 
reflected in the as-built exhibit filings without prior Commission 
approval.'' \16\ The Commission has emphasized that ``the determination 
of whether a particular change is substantial must be made on a case-
by-case basis.'' \17\

D. Current Processes for Post-Licensing Activities

    9. Some activities do not require an amendment but may require 
review and authorization to start construction from Commission dam 
safety staff.\18\ Commission approval of an amendment may be needed for 
more complex activities. Other minor post-licensing activities may 
require an amendment if they are inconsistent with the project license. 
For example, if the proposed work would cause a temporary change to an 
impoundment elevation or minimum flow requirement, an amendment may be 
required.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ Examples include in-kind replacements of racks/rakes/gates, 
flowlines, or turbines; generator rewinds; electrical equipment 
upgrades within a powerhouse; substation upgrades or rewiring; 
transmission line pole replacements; or minor repair of walls, 
tailraces, or spillways.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    10. For substantial changes to the specifications approved in the 
license, a licensee must file a license amendment. If a licensee is 
unsure whether an activity is authorized by the license or would 
require an amendment, the licensee may seek advice from Commission 
staff.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ See 18 CFR 4.201(d)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

E. Existing Commission Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act 
Authorizing Routine Activities by Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline 
Companies Without Case-Specific Authorization

    11. Under Part 157, Subpart F of the Commission's regulations,\20\ 
interstate pipelines that hold a certificate of public convenience and 
necessity under section 7 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) may apply for a 
one-time blanket certificate to undertake, without a case-specific 
authorization, certain activities automatically, subject only to annual 
reporting requirements \21\ and certain other activities after prior 
notice.\22\ The blanket certificate program ``provide[s] streamlined 
procedures which increase flexibility and reduce regulatory burden'' 
for a generic class of routine activities with particular conditions 
and procedures for consistency with the Commission's statutory 
obligations under the NGA and environmental statutes.\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ 18 CFR part 157, subpart F.
    \21\ Id. 157.203(b), 157.208(a), (e).
    \22\ Id. 157.203(c), 157.208(b).

Order No. 234, 47 FR 24254, at 24256, 24263 (June 4, 1982), FERC 
Stats. & Regs. ] 30,368, at 30,201 (1982) (cross-referenced at 19 
FERC ] 61,216); see also Revisions to the Blanket Certificate 
Reguls. & Clarification Regarding Rates, Order No. 686, 71 FR 63680 
(Oct. 31, 2006), 117 FERC ] 61,074, at P 7 (2006) (``The blanket 
certificate program was designed to provide an administratively 
efficient means to authorize a generic class of routine activities, 
without subjecting each minor project to a full, case-specific NGA 
section 7 certificate proceeding.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    12. In 1982, in instituting the blanket certificate program, the 
Commission explained that:

    [T]he final regulations divide the various actions that the 
Commission certificates into several categories. The first category 
applies to certain activities performed by interstate pipelines that 
. . . have relatively . . . little effect on pipeline operations. 
This first category also includes minor investments in facilities 
which are so well understood as an established industry practice 
that little scrutiny is required to determine their compatibility 
with the public convenience and necessity. The second category of 
activities provides for a notice and protest procedure and comprises 
certain activities in which various interested parties might have a 
concern. In such cases there is a need to provide an opportunity for 
a greater degree of review and to provide for possible adjudication 
of controversial aspects. Activities not authorized under the 
blanket certificate are those activities which . . . propose such 
important considerations that close scrutiny and case-specific 
deliberation by the Commission is warranted prior to the issuance of 
a certificate.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ Order No. 234, FERC Stats. & Regs. ] 30,368 at 30,200.

    13. The notice and protest procedures for prior notice projects 
allow anyone, including Commission staff, to protest a prior notice 
project within 60 days and, if a protest is not withdrawn or dismissed, 
the project is reviewed as an application for case-specific 
authorization under NGA section 7(c).\25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ 18 CFR 157.205(h).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    14. Blanket certificate activities are subject to the conditions in 
the Commission's regulations implementing NEPA,\26\ as well as 
requirements that all blanket certificate activities be consistent with 
all applicable laws, including the Endangered Species Act, National 
Historic Preservation Act, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and other 
applicable statutes relating to environmental concerns.\27\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ 18 CFR part 380. Certain activities undertaken pursuant to 
the blanket certificate are categorically excluded from NEPA review.

II. Subject of the Notice of Inquiry

    15. The Commission is inviting comments on (A) what opportunities, 
if any, are there to streamline or improve the process for licensees 
for using their authority under FPA section 10(a) and standard license 
Articles 2 and 3 to undertake minor modifications at a hydropower 
facility and whether the Commission should develop processes to address 
these opportunities, and (B) what changes, consistent with the 
requirements of the FPA and other applicable statutes, the Commission 
could make to its processes for reviewing and authorizing through 
amendment proceedings post-licensing activities, including whether 
certain activities can be implemented without case-specific 
authorization. The Commission seeks comment on the following questions:

A. Minor Post-Licensing Activities

    A1. What opportunities, if any, are there to streamline or improve 
the process for licensees for using their authority under FPA section 
10(a) and standard license Articles 2 and 3 to undertake minor 
modifications at a hydropower facility that do not require an 
amendment?
    A2. Should the Commission create a process for identifying minor 
post-licensing activities that can be undertaken pursuant to FPA 
section 10 and Articles 2 and 3?
    A3. Are there categories of minor post-licensing activities that 
should not require prior Commission approval? If so, what specific 
types of minor activities should qualify under each category?

[[Page 53313]]

    A4. What documentation should the Commission require to verify and 
ensure that these activities do not result in potentially adverse 
environmental or safety impacts?
    A5. What activities that do not require amendments should still 
require consultation or dam safety review? For those activities, what 
standard information should licensees file to expedite review of the 
proposed activity?
    A6. What applicable federal laws, permits, and regulations could be 
relied upon to verify minimal or no significant environmental and 
safety impacts throughout construction and operation of minor post-
licensing activities?
    A7. Should the Commission allow stakeholder input for activities 
not requiring an amendment? And if so, how should the comments be 
addressed?
    A8. Should specified maintenance activities be analyzed and 
approved during the licensing process as part of a life cycle approach 
to accepting, implementing, and maintaining a license for 30 to 50 
years?

B. Post-Licensing Activities Requiring Amendments

Process-Related Questions
    B1. If the Commission promulgates rules to allow for post-licensing 
activities at hydropower facilities, including maintenance, repairs, 
and upgrades to hydropower project infrastructure, without a case-
specific authorization under Part I of the FPA, should the Commission 
require each licensee to apply for a blanket FPA authorization as it 
does for natural gas pipelines pursuant to Part 157, Subpart F (see 18 
CFR 157.204(a)) or should all current and new licensees be 
automatically granted a blanket authorization?
    B2. Under the Commission's existing Part 157, Subpart F blanket 
certificate regulations for activities under NGA section 7, there is a 
two-tiered process whereby some activities are automatically authorized 
while others require prior notice (see 18 CFR 157.203(a)-(c)). Should 
the Commission adopt a similar tiered approach for post-licensing 
activities at hydropower facilities, including maintenance, repairs, 
and upgrades to hydropower project infrastructure? If so, should there 
be additional or different tiers, and what specific types of activities 
should correspond to each tier?
    B3. If the Commission allows for post-licensing activities at 
hydropower facilities, including maintenance, repairs, and upgrades to 
hydropower project infrastructure, automatically under a blanket FPA 
Part I authorization, should the Commission:
    a. require licensees to notify Commission staff of certain types of 
such activities prior to implementing them? And, if so, what amount of 
time would be sufficient?; and/or
    b. require a licensee to file a semi-annual or annual report 
documenting the post-licensing maintenance, repairs, and/or upgrades to 
hydropower project infrastructure undertaken during the previous 
calendar year pursuant to the blanket authorization program? If so, 
what information should be included in such reports? Should reporting 
of blanket authorization activities be incorporated into any reporting 
already required by the Commission in a licensee's license articles?
    B4. If the Commission requires prior notice for some post-licensing 
activities at hydropower facilities, including maintenance, repairs, 
and upgrades to hydropower project infrastructure, under a blanket FPA 
Part I authorization, should the Commission adopt the same notice 
requirements as those detailed in the Commission's blanket certificate 
regulations, including a 60-day notice period (see 18 CFR 157.205)?
    B5. Should the Commission adopt the same process concerning 
protests to prior notice post-licensing activities at hydropower 
facilities, including maintenance, repairs, and upgrades to hydropower 
project infrastructure, as is currently in place for prior notice 
blanket certificate pipeline projects (see 18 CFR 157.205) or should 
another process be required? If another process should be required, 
what types of protests should be dismissed?
    B6. What, if any, affected landowner notification requirements 
should the Commission adopt for post-licensing activities at hydropower 
facilities, including maintenance, repairs, and upgrades to hydropower 
project infrastructure, undertaken pursuant to a blanket authorization 
program?
    B7. Should the Commission require post-licensing maintenance, 
repairs, and/or upgrades to hydropower project infrastructure under a 
blanket Part I FPA authorization be constructed and placed into service 
within a specified timeframe? If so, what timeframe?
    B8. Are there processes that other federal or state agencies use to 
streamline review that the Commission could adapt?
    B9. What are the historic and estimated range of costs for 
preparation of an application for post-licensing amendments for 
maintenance, repairs, and upgrades at existing hydropower facilities?
Post-Licensing Activities That Could Fit a Blanket Program
    B10. If the Commission adopts a tiered approach similar to that in 
the natural gas blanket certificate regulations (18 CFR 157.203(b)-
(c)), what categories of post-licensing activities should be eligible 
for automatic authorization? What categories of post-licensing 
activities should be eligible for prior notice authorization? How 
should the Commission divide these categories, e.g., based on 
anticipated environmental effects or based on safety or security 
concerns?
    B11. What categories of post-licensing activities would result in 
no adverse impacts to the environment or safety at authorized and 
existing licensed hydropower facilities? Specifically, what types of 
facility modifications, systems, or components would have no adverse 
environmental or safety impacts, or would provide beneficial impacts, 
to the following resources:
    <bullet> Water Quality;
    <bullet> Water Resources;
    <bullet> Wetlands;
    <bullet> Fisheries and Wildlife, including Endangered Species;
    <bullet> Vegetation;
    <bullet> Cultural Resources;
    <bullet> Socioeconomics;
    <bullet> Geology and Soils;
    <bullet> Land Use;
    <bullet> Recreation;
    <bullet> Visual Resources; and
    <bullet> Safety.
    B12. What categories of post-licensing activities would provide 
equivalent or greater level of environmental protection and safety 
compared to the status quo? Specifically, what types of hydropower 
infrastructure modifications, systems, or components would result in 
different impacts but nevertheless provide an equivalent or greater 
level of protection to the resources listed in question B11?
    B13. What categories of post-licensing activities would result in 
less than significant impacts to the environment and safety at licensed 
hydropower facilities such that the Commission could categorically 
determine that such activities are in the public interest under the 
section 10(a)(1) comprehensive development standard of the FPA? 
Specifically, what types of facility modifications, systems, or 
components would result in less than significant impacts to the 
resources listed in question B11?
    16. While the Commission will consider all comments filed, the

[[Page 53314]]

Commission may not, and is not required to, take further action.
