DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

[Project No. 15380-000]


Robertson Power Company, LLC; Notice of Preliminary Permit 
Application Accepted for Filing and Soliciting Comments, Motions To 
Intervene, and Competing Applications

    On October 31, 2024, Robertson Power Company, LLC, filed an 
application for a preliminary permit, pursuant to section 4(f) of the 
Federal Power Act (FPA), proposing to study the feasibility of the 
Somersworth Mill Hydroelectric Project No. 15380-000 (project), to be 
located at the Somersworth Mill dam on the Salmon Falls River near the 
Town of Somersworth in Strafford County, New Hampshire, and Berwick, 
York County, Maine. The sole purpose of a preliminary permit, if 
issued, is to grant the permit holder priority to file a license 
application during the permit term. A preliminary permit does not 
authorize the permit holder to perform any land-disturbing activities 
or otherwise enter upon lands or waters owned by others without the 
owners' express permission.
    The proposed project would consist of the following features: (1) 
an existing 400-foot-long, 16.5-foot-high stone gravity dam (Stone 
Dam); (2) an existing impoundment having a surface area of

[[Page 52945]]

50 acres and a storage capacity of 300 acre-feet at a water surface 
elevation of 98.7 feet mean sea level; (3) an existing gatehouse with 
four intake gates and a fill gate leading to a power canal; (4) an 
existing 1,600-foot-long, 20-foot-wide, and 15-foot-deep granite block 
and stone constructed power canal; (5) a new 600-foot-long, 10-foot-
diameter penstock to be made of concrete or steel; (6) an existing 32-
foot-high, 40-foot-wide brick and concrete powerhouse containing two 
1,100 kilowatt (kW) turbine-generator units, each with a maximum 
hydraulic capacity of 460 cubic feet per second; (7) an existing 107-
foot-long, 19-foot-high gravity lower stone dam adjacent to the 
powerhouse (Back Dam); (8) an existing .48/4.16 kilovolt (kV) 
transformer; (9) a 250-foot-long 4.16 kV transmission line; and (10) 
appurtenant facilities. The proposed project would have an estimated 
annual generation of 6.7-gigawatt-hours.
