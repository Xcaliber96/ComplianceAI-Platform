[Docket No. FRA-2025-0852, Notice No. 1]


Review of Quiet Zone in Miami, Florida

AGENCY: Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Department of 
Transportation (DOT).

ACTION: Notice of quiet zone review.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: FRA is providing notice of its intent to review a quiet zone 
(THR-000000111223) located in Miami, Florida. Based on a high rate of 
reported accidents/incidents between January 2020 and January 2025, FRA 
has made a preliminary determination that safety systems and measures 
implemented within the quiet zone do not fully compensate for the 
absence of routine sounding of the locomotive horn due to a substantial 
increase in risk with respect to loss of life or serious personal 
injury within the quiet zone. Further, FRA discovered that the 
documentation submitted and relied upon by the City of Miami (the 
Public Authority) to establish the quiet zone may contain substantial 
errors that have an adverse impact on public safety. Therefore, FRA 
intends to review existing conditions within the quiet zone to 
determine whether it should be terminated or whether additional safety 
measures may be necessary to ensure safety.

DATES: Written comments must be received on or before December 24, 
2025. FRA will consider comments filed after this date to the extent 
practicable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    In a Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment (NOE) letter, dated August 
27, 2012, the Public Authority established a quiet zone by designation 
under 49 CFR 222.39(a)(3) with an effective date of September 30, 2012. 
The quiet zone, which extends from NE 71st Street (U.S. DOT Crossing 
Inventory No. 272622C) to the Bayside pedestrian crossing (U.S. DOT 
Crossing Inventory No. 273139L), includes the following highway-rail 
and pedestrian grade crossings:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    According to the NOE, this crossing corridor qualified for quiet 
zone status on the basis of having a Quiet Zone Risk Index (QZRI) that 
was below the Risk Index With Horns (RIWH).\2\ Therefore, the NOE 
indicated that the Public Authority had taken sufficient measures to 
compensate for the excess risk that results from restricting routine 
train horn sounding at the grade crossings identified in the notice.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ U.S. DOT Crossing Inventory No. 273133V was not included in 
the NOE dated August 27, 2012 from the Public Authority but falls 
within the boundaries of the quiet zone.
    \2\ See 49 CFR 222.39(a)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Substantial Increase in Risk

    Between January 2020 and January 2025, there have been 23 accident/
incidents within this quiet zone.\3\ As reflected in the table below, 
11 accident/incidents have resulted in either injury or fatality, with 
9 persons injured and 2 fatalities.\4\ Therefore, in accordance with 49 
CFR 222.51(c), FRA has made a preliminary determination that there is 
significant risk with respect to loss of life or serious personal 
injury within this quiet zone necessitating FRA review.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Since January 2025, additional incidents continue to be 
reported within the quiet zone.
    \4\ The table only lists incidents that resulted in an injury or 
a fatality. There were 17 incidents at grade crossings and 6 
incidents involving trespassers not at grade crossings. Five grade 
crossing incidents resulted in injury and four trespasser incidents 
resulted in injury. In addition, two separate trespasser incidents 
resulted in fatalities.

Inadequate Safety Measures

    In 2012, initially to demonstrate to FRA that the QZRI was lower 
than the RIWH, the Public Authority relied upon pre-existing 
Supplemental Safety Measures (SSMs) \8\ to reduce existing risk levels 
within the quiet zone. However, railroad operating circumstances have 
significantly changed since 2012. Most notably, beginning in May 2018, 
Brightline (BLF) now operates passenger trains to and from a newly 
built station, MiamiCentral. In early 2024, the South Florida Regional 
Transportation Authority (SFRV or Tri-Rail) began operating passenger 
trains to MiamiCentral as well. This has resulted in an increase in 
train traffic from approximately 4 trains per day to over 50 trains per 
day. The accidents/incidents described above, along with the increase 
in train traffic, has caused

[[Page 53053]]

the QZRI for this quiet zone to rise to a level above the RIWH.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Florida East Coast Railway (FEC).
    \6\ Brightline Florida (BLF).
    \7\ South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRV or 
Tri-Rail).
    \8\ A Supplementary Safety Measure (SSM) is a safety system or 
procedure established in accordance with 49 CFR part 222, which is 
provided by the appropriate traffic control authority or law 
enforcement authority responsible for safety at the highway-rail 
grade crossing, that is determined by the FRA Associate 
Administrator for Railroad Safety to be an effective substitute for 
the locomotive horn in the prevention of highway-rail casualties. 
See 49 CFR 222.9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, the maximum timetable speed \9\ for all trains, 
including passenger, increased from 20 miles per hour (mph) to 40 mph 
for several miles of track, and a second main track was constructed. 
The crossings affected by the speed increase were on the Port Lead from 
MP PL 0.00 to PL 3.75. The Public Authority has not implemented any 
SSMs or Alternative Safety Measures (ASMs) \10\ since the establishment 
of the quiet zone to compensate for the increased train traffic, new 
railroad infrastructure, and higher train speeds. All twelve quiet zone 
crossings on the Port Lead were affected by this maximum timetable 
speed increase.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ The maximum timetable speed references the highest maximum 
speed any train may travel through the crossing and is determined by 
the railroad in accordance with the relevant operating conditions 
and track class. This speed is denoted on the U.S. DOT Crossing 
Inventory Form in Part II, Box 3. The maximum timetable speed is 
factored into determining the RIWH and QZRI by the Quiet Zone 
Calculator.
    \10\ An Alternative Safety Measure (ASM) is a safety system or 
procedure, other than an SSM, established in accordance with 49 CFR 
part 222, which is provided by the appropriate traffic control 
authority or law enforcement authority and which, after individual 
review and analysis by the FRA Associate Administrator for Railroad 
Safety, is determined to be an effective substitute for the 
locomotive horn in the prevention of highway-rail casualties at 
specific highway-rail grade crossings. See 49 CFR 222.9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improper Documentation

    FRA noted the following inaccuracies when comparing the 
documentation relied upon to establish the quiet zone with current 
conditions:
    <bullet> The required list of crossings in the NOE does not include 
the pedestrian grade crossing at MP DL 1.15 (U.S. DOT Crossing 
Inventory No. 273133V).
    <bullet> The Quiet Zone Calculator data in the NOE does not include 
the Port Boulevard crossing (U.S. DOT Crossing Inventory No. 272960A), 
which artificially reduced the QZRI.
    <bullet> A diagnostic team review of the pedestrian grade crossings 
in the quiet zone was required by 49 CFR 222.27. No record or comments 
from a diagnostic team review of any pedestrian grade crossing were 
included in the NOE.
    During FRA's review of the documentation submitted to establish the 
quiet zone, FRA noted additional discrepancies, including outdated 
annual average daily traffic counts and incomplete Quiet Zone 
Calculator documentation.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ The U.S. DOT Crossing Inventory forms contained in the NOE 
indicated that an Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) analysis had 
not been performed since 1988 on any highway-rail grade crossings in 
the quiet zone.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Non-Compliance With the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices 
(MUTCD)

    FRA conducted a field inspection of each quiet zone crossing in 
October 2024 and provided a summary of its findings to the Public 
Authority in January 2025. The inspection uncovered numerous exceptions 
to the standards and guidance of the MUTCD.\12\ Most notable was the 
absence or improper use of ``No Train Horn'' signs or plaques at 
several grade crossings. FRA conducted a follow-up inspection in April 
2025 and observed that, except for the installation of several ``No 
Train Horn'' signs, most of the exceptions have not been corrected. The 
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has reviewed the documented MUTCD 
non-compliance and concurs with FRA's findings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ FHWA publishes the MUTCD, which contains national design, 
application, and placement standards, guidance, options, and support 
provisions for traffic control devices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scope of Review

    From the inception of FRA's rulemaking on the use of locomotive 
horns at public highway-rail grade crossings (indeed, beginning with 
FRA's issuance of Emergency Order No. 15 \13\ in 1991), FRA has adopted 
a corridor-wide approach to evaluating and mitigating risk within quiet 
zones, instead of requiring the implementation of risk mitigation 
measures at each public highway-rail grade crossing located within a 
quiet zone. A corridor-wide approach permits the most efficient 
deployment of risk reduction measures and encourages public authorities 
to focus their resources on addressing the most hazardous public 
highway-rail grade crossings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ 56 FR 36190 (July 31, 1991).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This quiet zone is located on the BLF and SFRV passenger rail 
corridor. When first established in 2012, the Dodge Island Lead (DL) 
consisted of one continuous track into the Port of Miami. Since then, 
this rail line has been split into two different sections: the Port 
Lead (PL) and the DL.\14\ This quiet zone contains PL and DL crossings. 
Accordingly, the scope of FRA's review may include an analysis of the 
current configuration of the quiet zone.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ The PL connects the FEC mainline southbound to MiamiCentral 
(PL 0.00 to PL 4.51). The DL splits off at PL 3.53 and then runs 
parallel until it crosses under the elevated PL at the NW 8th Street 
crossing (U.S. DOT Crossing Inventory No. 272647X) and turns east to 
the Port of Miami. The DL terminates at the Port of Miami.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Interested parties are invited to submit written comments to the 
docket. FRA is interested in obtaining information from the public 
about any unsafe actions that have been observed at any of the above-
listed grade crossings. This could include information about motorists 
or pedestrians who have been observed engaging in unsafe actions. FRA 
is also interested in obtaining information from the Public Authority 
about the effectiveness of existing quiet zone crossing safety 
improvements, as well any additional quiet zone safety improvements 
that may be under consideration and the anticipated timeline for 
implementing any such improvements.
    After the comment period closes, the Associate Administrator may 
require that additional safety measures be taken or that the quiet zone 
be terminated. The Associate Administrator will provide a copy of his 
decision to the Public Authority as well as the railroads that operate 
through the quiet zone and the State agencies responsible for grade 
crossing, highway, and road safety.
