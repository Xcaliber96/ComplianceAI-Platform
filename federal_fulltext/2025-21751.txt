DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration

[Docket No. FMCSA-2025-0084]


Entry-Level Driver Training: Application for Exemption; Montana 
Trucking Association

AGENCY: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), Department 
of Transportation (DOT).

ACTION: Notice of final disposition; grant of application for 
exemption.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: FMCSA announces its decision to grant an exemption from the 
qualification requirements pertaining to entry-level driver training 
(ELDT) theory instructors for Montana Trucking Association's Safety 
Coordinator, Mr. William Cole. The exemption will allow Mr. Cole to 
conduct classroom (theory) training for entry-level drivers who intend 
to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMV) used in the transportation 
of hazardous materials (HM). The exemption excuses Mr. Cole from the 
requirement to possess a commercial driver's license (CDL) or have 
previously held a CDL. FMCSA analyzed the application and public 
comments and determined that granting the exemption is likely to 
achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the 
level that would be achieved in the absence of the exemption.

DATES: The exemption is effective December 2, 2025 and expires December 
2, 2030.

II. Legal Basis

    FMCSA has authority under 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b) to grant 
exemptions from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. FMCSA 
must publish a notice of each exemption request in the Federal Register 
(49 CFR 381.315(a)). The Agency must provide the public an opportunity 
to inspect the information relevant to the application, including the 
applicant's safety analysis. The Agency must provide an opportunity for 
public comment on the request.
    The Agency reviews the application, safety analyses and public 
comments submitted and determines whether granting the exemption would 
likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the 
level that would be achieved absent such exemption, pursuant to the 
standard set forth in 49 U.S.C. 31315(b)(1). The Agency must publish 
its decision in the Federal Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, 
the notice will identify the regulatory provision from which the 
applicant will be exempt, the effective period, and all terms and 
conditions of the exemption (49 CFR 381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption is 
denied, the notice will explain the

[[Page 55331]]

reason for the denial (49 CFR 381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may be 
renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)).

III. Background

Current Regulatory Requirements

    The Agency's ELDT regulations, set forth in 49 CFR part 380, 
subparts F and G, establish theory and behind-the wheel (BTW) training 
requirements for individuals seeking to obtain a Class A or Class B CDL 
or a passenger (P), school bus (S), or hazardous materials (H) 
endorsement for the first time. The regulations require that ELDT be 
conducted only by qualified training providers and training 
instructors; drivers must obtain ELDT from a training provider listed 
on FMCSA's Training Provider Registry.
    As set forth in the definition of ``theory instructor'' in 49 CFR 
380.605, theory instructors must meet one of these qualifications: (1) 
The instructor holds a CDL of the same (or higher) class and with all 
endorsements necessary to operate the CMV for which training is to be 
provided and has at least 2 years of experience driving a CMV requiring 
a CDL of the same (or higher) class and/or the same endorsement and 
meets all applicable State qualification requirements for CMV 
instructors; or (2) the instructor holds a CDL of the same (or higher) 
class and with all endorsements necessary to operate the CMV for which 
training is to be provided, and has at least 2 years of experience as a 
BTW CMV instructor and meets all applicable State qualification 
requirements for CMV instructors. The definition of ``theory 
instructor'' in 49 CFR 380.605 includes an exception from the 
requirement that the instructor currently hold a CDL and relevant 
endorsements, if the instructor previously held a CDL of the same or 
higher class and complies with the other requirements set forth in the 
definition.
    Because applicants are not required to take an HM-specific skills 
test to obtain the H endorsement, the ELDT regulations do not contain a 
BTW curriculum requirement applicable to that endorsement. There are, 
however, BTW ELDT requirements for applicants seeking a Class A or 
Class B CDL or a P or S endorsement.

Applicant's Request

    Montana Trucking Association's request for an exemption was 
described in detail in a Federal Register notice on May 20, 2025 (90 FR 
21820) and will not be repeated as the facts have not changed.

IV. Public Comments

    The Agency received three comments; two opposing comments and one 
comment that was neither for nor against the exemption. AWM Associates, 
LLC said, ``If Mr. Cole has never had a CDL? How can he teach the 
curriculum? I appreciate Mr. Cole's expertise; however, it's better 
suited for the training requirements in 49 CFR Part Sec.  172.704. Mr. 
Cole's application should be denied.''
    Cliff Abbott commented, ``If it is necessary, or desirable, to make 
changes to required training, it should be done for all drivers, not 
simply for students of one particular instructor regardless of his/her 
credentials list.''
    Michael Ravnitzky suggested a pilot program that would allow Mr. 
Cole to teach the theory portions of the HM curriculum independently, 
have a co-instructor or guest lecturer with the required 
qualifications, track accidents involving Mr. Cole's trainees, and 
analyze performance data.

V. FMCSA Decision

    FMCSA has evaluated Mr. Cole's application for exemption and the 
public comments. The Agency evaluated Mr. Cole's qualifications, which 
includes a resume highlighting 14 years of experience as a CMV 
Enforcement Officer specializing in HM transportation. His credentials 
also feature certifications from the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance 
(CVSA) for completing the Introduction to HM Instructor Training and 
the Advanced Courses in HM Instructor Training, both awarded in 2023. 
FMCSA's National Training Center verified that Mr. Cole successfully 
completed 40 hours of General Hazardous Materials training in 2010 and 
40 hours of North American Standard--Parts A and B in 2013.
    While two commenters opposed the application, they did not 
specifically challenge Mr. Cole's credentials. FMCSA granted a similar 
exemption to an instructor for Oak Harbor Freight Lines, Inc. in 2022 
(87 FR 30551). Because Mr. Cole will be limited to conducting classroom 
theory training and not BTW training, the Agency believes the exemption 
will likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater 
than, the level that will be achieved absent such exemption, in 
accordance with 49 CFR 381.305(a).

VI. Exemption

A. Applicability of Exemption

    This exemption from qualification requirements set forth in the 
definition of ``theory instructor'' in 49 CFR 380.605 will allow Mr. 
William Cole to provide ELDT theory instructions for the H endorsement 
curriculum in Appendix E of Part 380 without possessing a CDL or having 
to have previously held a CDL.

B. Terms and Conditions

    To provide ELDT instruction under this exemption, Mr. Cole must, 
within 30 days of employment, submit the name of the registered 
training provider(s) he is employed by and any subsequent changes to 
his employer to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f9b4baa9aabdb99d968dd79e968f"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2b66687b786f6b4f445f054c445d">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

C. Preemption

    In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31315(d), as implemented by 49 CFR 
381.600, during the period this exemption is in effect, no State shall 
enforce any law or regulation applicable to interstate commerce that 
conflicts, or is inconsistent, with this exemption with respect to a 
firm or person operating under the exemption. States may, but are not 
required to, adopt the same exemption with respect to operations in 
intrastate commerce.

VII. Termination

    FMCSA does not believe there will be any deterioration in safety 
stemming from this exemption. However, the exemption will be rescinded 
if: (1) William Cole fails to comply with the terms and conditions of 
the exemption; (2) the exemption has resulted in a lower level of 
safety than would be achieved in the absence of the exemption; or (3) 
continuation of the exemption would not be consistent with the goals 
and objects of 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b).
