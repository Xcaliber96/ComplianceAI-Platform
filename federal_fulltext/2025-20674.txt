Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

[Docket No. CP25-551-000]


Great Basin Gas Transmission Company; Notice of Schedule for the 
Preparation of an Environmental Assessment for the Gabs Lateral NASF 
Relocation Project

    On September 29, 2025, Great Basin Gas Transmission Company (Great 
Basin) filed an application in Docket No. CP25-551-000 requesting a 
Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity pursuant to Section 
7(c) and Authorization pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act 
to construct and operate and abandon certain natural gas pipeline 
facilities. The proposed project is known as the Gabbs Lateral Naval 
Air Station Fallon (NASF) Relocation Project (Project) and would 
support the relocation of its existing Gabbs Lateral through the 
installation of approximately 32.6 miles of replacement pipeline and 
the abandonment in-place or by removal of approximately 20.9 miles of 
pipeline in Mineral and Nye Counties, Nevada. The Project would not 
provide any incremental capacity. Additionally, the Project would 
accommodate the U.S. Navy's expansion of the Naval Air Station Fallon.
    On October 10, 2025, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
(Commission or FERC) issued its Notice of Application for the Project. 
Among other things, that notice alerted agencies issuing federal 
authorizations of the requirement to complete all necessary reviews and 
to reach a final decision on a request for a federal authorization 
within 90 days of the date of issuance of the Commission staff's 
environmental document for the Project.
    This notice identifies Commission staff's intention to prepare an 
environmental assessment (EA) for the Project and the planned schedule 
for the completion of the environmental review.\1\ The EA will be 
issued for a 30-day comment period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For tracking purposes under the National Environmental 
Policy Act, the unique identification number for documents relating 
to this environmental review is EAXX-019-20-000-1762338293.

Schedule for Environmental Review

Issuance of EA--March 13, 2026
90-day Federal Authorization Decision Deadline \2\--June 11, 2026
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The Commission's deadline applies to the decisions of other 
federal agencies, and state agencies acting under federally 
delegated authority, that are responsible for federal 
authorizations, permits, and other approvals necessary for proposed 
projects under the Natural Gas Act. Per 18 CFR 157.22(a), the 
Commission's deadline for other agency's decisions applies unless a 
schedule is otherwise established by federal law.

    If a schedule change becomes necessary, additional notice will be 
provided so that the relevant agencies are kept informed of the 
Project's progress.

Project Description

    The Project would accommodate the U.S. Navy's congressionally 
authorized Fallon Range Training Complex Modernization Project. Great 
Basin proposes to: (1) install about 18.8 miles of new 8-inch-diameter 
pipeline and 13.8 miles of new 6-inch-diameter pipeline; and (2) 
abandon in place or by removal about 5.4 miles of existing 8-inch-
diameter pipe and 15.8 miles of existing 6-inch-diameter pipe. 
Additionally Great Basin would install two above-ground valve 
assemblies, replace a thermoelectric generator with a natural gas 
burning generator for the cathodic protection system, and relocate an 
appurtenant facility.

Background

    On October 9, 2024, the Commission issued a Notice of Scoping 
Period Requesting Comments on Environmental Issues for the Proposed 
Gabbs Lateral FNAS Relocation Project (Notice of Scoping). The Notice 
of Scoping was issued during the pre-filing review of the Project in 
Docket No. PF24-6-000 and was sent to affected landowners; federal, 
state, and local government agencies; elected officials; environmental 
and public interest groups; Native American tribes; other interested 
parties; and local libraries and newspapers. In response to the Notice 
of Scoping, the Commission received comments from Joe Burgess and the 
Nevada Department of Wildlife. The commenters requested that an 
environmental analysis should be completed and that baseline surveys of 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) sensitive and state listed species 
should be conducted. All substantive comments will be addressed in the 
EA.
    The BLM and the U.S. Navy are cooperating agencies in the 
preparation of the EA.
