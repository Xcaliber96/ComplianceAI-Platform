SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Background: FASTA created the PBRB as an independent Board to 
identify opportunities for the Federal government to significantly 
reduce its inventory of civilian real property and thereby reduce 
costs. The Board is directed, within 6 months of its formation, to 
recommend to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) the sale of not 
fewer than five properties not on the list of surplus or excess with a 
fair market value of not less than $500 million and not more than $750 
million. The Board, to date, has submitted three rounds of 
recommendations. The Thomas R. Carper Water Resources Development Act 
of 2024 (WRDA) extended the Board to December 31, 2026 and allows for 
the submission of one additional round of recommendations (Round 3).
    Format and Registration: The format for the meeting will be panel 
discussions with appropriate time allowed for a Q&A segment. 
Participants may also view the meeting virtually. Interested
