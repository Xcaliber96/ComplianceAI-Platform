Services at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#efaca2acbcaf8c829cc187879cc1888099"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6a292729392a09071944020219440d051c">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    This notice provides information regarding the provision of certain 
information collected by the Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS), Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), with U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its component agency U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CMS partners with states to 
administer Medicaid. In doing so, CMS collects information regarding 
individuals for a variety of purposes related to administration, 
oversight, and program integrity. This notice applies to data collected 
by CMS in connection with its role in the Medicaid program.
    CMS receives information related to immigration status because it 
is relevant to the Medicaid program. For example, under Medicaid, 
states are prohibited from claiming federal financial participation 
(FFP) for ``medical assistance furnished to an alien who is not 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently 
residing in the United States under color of law.'' Section 1903(v)(1) 
of the Social Security Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1396b(v)(1)). The 
exception to this prohibition is that FFP can be paid if the care and 
services are ``necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical 
condition of the alien,'' the alien otherwise meets the eligibility 
requirements for Medicaid, and the care and services are not related to 
an organ transplant procedure. Section 1903(v)(2) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 
1396b(v)(2)).
    Federal laws govern the collection, use, and disclosure of CMS 
information. Depending on the type of information, applicable laws may 
include the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), section 1106(a) of the 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1306(a)(1)) and CMS implementing regulations at 42 CFR 
part 401, subpart B, and other federal laws. In addition, CMS has 
established a robust privacy and security program (<a href="https://security.cms.gov/topic/privacy">https://security.cms.gov/topic/privacy</a>). CMS has previously stated on its 
website that the information regarding individuals that it collects 
will only be used for administration of its programs. See, e.g., CMS, 
CMS Privacy Home Page, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/about-cms/information-systems/privacy">https://www.cms.gov/about-cms/information-systems/privacy</a> (``To protect your privacy, we'll tell you before we 
collect any personal information we need to run our health care 
programs, and only use it for that purpose.''). CMS also has stated on 
its website that it will not use immigration status for immigration 
enforcement purposes. See CMS, More information for immigrant 
households, <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/immigrants/immigrant-families/">https://www.healthcare.gov/immigrants/immigrant-families/</a> 
(``We won't use any immigration status you share with us for 
immigration enforcement purposes.''). This policy statement was made in 
the context of and in reliance on a 2013 ICE policy that stated that 
ICE would not use CMS data or information provided by individuals to 
obtain coverage for certain benefits under CMS programs as the basis 
for pursuing a civil immigration enforcement action. ICE has rescinded 
this policy.\1\ See ICE Policy Memorandum 11066.2, Use of HHS 
Information and Rescission of ICE Policy Memorandum 11066.1, 
Clarification of Existing Practices Related to Certain Health Care 
Information (October 25, 2013, 2013 Policy Memorandum), (Oct. 27, 2025, 
ICE Policy Memorandum 11066.2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ ICE notes that it is currently precluded from using this 
information due to a Preliminary Injunction and it will proceed with 
this policy when the Preliminary Injunction is lifted. See ICE 
Policy Memorandum 11066.2, see also California v. HHS, No. 25-05536 
(N.D. Cal. filed July 1, 2025). Under that same Preliminary 
Injunction, CMS is currently precluded from sharing certain Medicaid 
data with ICE for immigration enforcement purposes. Similarly, CMS 
will proceed with this policy when the Preliminary Injunction is 
lifted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Legal Authority

    Several federal laws authorize CMS to make certain information 
available to

[[Page 53325]]

DHS. See ICE Policy Memorandum 11066.2.
    <bullet> Under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security shall have access to information ``relating to 
matters under the responsibility of the Secretary that may be 
collected, possessed, or prepared by an agency of the Federal 
Government as the President may further provide.'' 6 U.S.C. 122(a)(2). 
Additionally, the Secretary of Homeland Security can obtain this 
information upon request and can enter into cooperative agreements with 
other agencies to provide DHS officials with access to the data on a 
regular or routine basis, including requests or arrangements involving 
broad categories of material, access to electronic databases, or both. 
6 U.S.C. 122(b).
    <bullet> Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, ``[a]ny 
information in any records kept by any department or agency of the 
Government as to the identity and location of aliens in the United 
States shall be made available to'' immigration authorities. 8 U.S.C. 
1360(b). This ``expansive'' language reaches ``broad[ ] swaths of 
information'' in the possession of the federal government. United 
States v. California, 921 F.3d 865, 892 (9th Cir. 2019).
    Moreover, under 8 U.S.C. 1373, ``[n]otwithstanding any other 
provision of Federal, State, or local law, a Federal, State, or local 
government entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, 
any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, 
[DHS] information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, 
lawful or unlawful, of any individual.'' 8 U.S.C. 1373(a). 
Additionally, ``[n]otwithstanding any other provisions of Federal, 
State, or local law, no person or agency may prohibit, or in any way 
restrict, a Federal, State, or local government entity'' from 
transmitting, maintaining, or exchanging information regarding 
immigration status with any other Federal, State, or local government 
entity. 8 U.S.C. 1373(b).
    <bullet> The Privacy Act of 1974 does not provide authority for a 
disclosure. However, with respect to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent 
residents, an exception in the law would not require an agency to 
obtain prior written consent of the individual to whom the record 
pertains to disclose a record contained in a system of records to 
another federal agency ``for a civil or criminal law enforcement 
activity if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the 
agency has made a written request to the agency which maintains the 
record specifying the particular portion desired and the law 
enforcement activity for which the record is sought,'' See 5 U.S.C. 
552a(b)(7).\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The Privacy Act of 1974 only applies to U.S. citizens and 
lawful permanent residents. See 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(2) (defining 
individual to include U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Purpose of Information Sharing

    This notice announces CMS policy that CMS will provide certain 
information to ICE upon request from ICE consistent with federal laws 
to advance administration priorities related to immigration laid out in 
the following Executive Orders.
    <bullet> Executive Order 14159, ``Protecting the American People 
Against Invasion''--The purpose of this Executive Order is to ``ensure[ 
] that the Federal Government protects the American people by 
faithfully executing immigration laws of the United States.'' (90 FR 
8443, January 29, 2025).
    <bullet> Executive Order 14165, ``Securing Our Borders''--This 
Executive Order establishes a policy of the United States ``to take all 
appropriate action to secure the borders of our Nation'' through a 
range of means, including deterring and preventing the entry of illegal 
aliens into the United States, and removing promptly all aliens who 
enter or remain in violation of Federal law. (90 FR 8467, January 30, 
2025).
    <bullet> Executive Order 14218, ``Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of 
Open Borders''--This Executive Order directs federal agencies to 
faithfully carry out the immigration laws and ``to ensure, to the 
maximum extent permitted by law, that no taxpayer-funded benefits go to 
unqualified aliens.'' (90 FR 10581, February 25, 2025).
    <bullet> Executive Order 14243, ``Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse 
by Eliminating Information Silo''--One of the purposes of this 
Executive Order is to promote inter-agency data sharing. It directs 
agencies to ``take all necessary steps, to the maximum extent 
consistent with law,'' to ensure access to information ``for purposes 
of pursuing Administration priorities related to the identification and 
elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse.'' (90 FR 13681, March 25, 
2025).
    As noted by ICE in ICE Policy Memorandum 11066.2, certain 
information held by CMS is useful for immigration enforcement purposes 
and to support the full and efficient execution of ICE's mission. ICE 
Policy Memorandum 11066.2 at 4. This CMS information ``represents a 
particular set of accurate and quality data that can be used to enhance 
ICE's data and improve its law enforcement actions.'' Id. More broadly, 
using CMS information as detailed in the ICE Policy Memorandum 11066.2 
``allows ICE to more efficiently achieve its mission of preserving 
national security and public safety.'' Id.

IV. Information To Be Shared

    ICE announced that, at this time, it contemplates requesting from 
CMS available biographical, contact, and location information, though 
ICE reserved the right, in a specific case, to consider requesting 
other information on a case-by-case basis as permitted by law. Id. at 
2. This CMS information may include Medicaid information or data shared 
with CMS by states. CMS will share the minimum required information 
with ICE, giving due consideration to the information requested by ICE, 
the federal laws that govern the provision of information to DHS and 
the CMS information requested, the capabilities of CMS systems, and the 
CMS resources available to respond to ICE information requests. 
Examples of information that CMS may share with ICE include the 
following: citizenship and immigration status, location, and phone 
numbers, and, in specific cases, other information on a case-by-case 
basis as permitted by law. CMS will respond to requests made by ICE and 
will transfer any information to ICE in a secure manner and establish 
appropriate safeguards for the information provided, including through 
written agreements or other arrangements with ICE.
    CMS intends its provision of various categories of information to 
be severable from each other. For instance, CMS's provision of 
biographical information about aliens is severable from its provision 
of location information about aliens or from its provision of other 
types of information that ICE does not presently intend to request for 
immigration enforcement purposes. In the event a court finds that ICE 
does not have a right to access a specific type of data (or that CMS is 
not authorized to provide such data), CMS intends that the provision of 
specific categories of data be severable from each other.

V. Reliance Interests

    CMS has considered the fact that states, providers, beneficiaries, 
health insurance issuers, other regulated entities, and the general 
public may have relied on past CMS statements that information 
collected by CMS would only be used for program administration purposes 
and would not be used for immigration enforcement purposes. The CMS 
statements were made against the backdrop of federal laws that 
authorize

[[Page 53326]]

CMS to share information with DHS, upon request, and a policy choice 
made by ICE not to use certain information as the basis for pursuing a 
civil immigration enforcement action. These federal laws have long 
apprised the regulated public that immigration authorities have access 
to ``broad swaths'' of information possessed by other federal agencies 
relevant to immigration enforcement. Brief of Appellee State of 
California in United States v. California, No. 18-16496, 2018 WL 
5880015 (9th Cir. Nov. 5, 2018) (``When Congress has intended to reach 
broad swaths of information, or specifically a person's address, it has 
used different words. For example . . . the INA requires federal 
agencies to communicate to ICE, upon request, `[a]ny information in any 
records . . . as to the identity and location of aliens,' [8 U.S.C. 
1360(b).]'')); see also Policy Memorandum 11066.2 at 4. To ensure that 
the public is aware that CMS intends to disclose certain information to 
DHS consistent with federal laws, including available information 
contained in program eligibility information, CMS is publishing this 
notice and will update relevant websites to reflect that federal laws 
authorize CMS to share certain information with DHS.
    ICE determined, as stated in ICE Policy Memorandum 11066.2, that 
the ``value of this information to immigration and criminal law 
enforcement operations outweighs any relevant reliance interests.'' ICE 
Policy Memorandum 11066.2 at 4. Pursuant to the 6 U.S.C. 122(a)-(b), 8 
U.S.C. 1360(b), and 8 U.S.C. 1373, ``ICE has always had authority to 
request and receive information for immigration enforcement purposes.'' 
ICE Policy Memorandum 11066.2 at 5.
    As ICE stated, ``[t]he statutory provisions that both give ICE the 
right to request this information, and that require aliens to 
affirmatively provide that information to ICE upon request, are 
longstanding, and there is no exception to their application under 
Medicaid.'' ICE Policy Memorandum 11066.2 at 6.
    Given the longstanding legal requirements for aliens to apprise 
immigration authorities of their whereabouts, whatever reliance states, 
providers, beneficiaries, health insurance issuers, other regulated 
entities, and the general public have placed on DHS's exercise of its 
enforcement discretion and CMS's information not being shared with 
immigration authorities due to that exercise of discretion is entitled 
to little to no weight. The biographical and location information that 
ICE intends to seek from CMS is information that ICE has long had a 
right to access. Accordingly, any interests in not sharing this 
information with ICE are greatly diminished and outweighed by ICE's 
legitimate law enforcement interests.
    Moreover, while some states and providers contend that it would be 
detrimental to public health if aliens do not partake in federal health 
benefits for which they are eligible (for example, federally funded 
Medicaid services for emergency medical conditions) because if CMS 
shares information with ICE, the legal requirements regarding 
information sharing with ICE long predate restrictions on Medicaid to 
unqualified aliens. Compare, e.g., 8 U.S.C. 1360(b) (enacted in 
Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 163, 234 (1952)), with 42 
U.S.C. 1396b(v)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1611(b)(1)(A) (enacted in Personal 
Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, 110 
Stat. 2105, 2180). The concerns of states and providers are entitled to 
little to no weight because they reflect the scheme that Congress 
created, which provides benefits to aliens under certain limited 
circumstances and gives immigration authorities the right to access 
information that arises from the conferral of those benefits.
    Finally, to the extent that states provide data to CMS on aliens 
who receive health benefits or services funded only by the state, 
states are doing so voluntarily. CMS only requires states to submit 
data associated with beneficiaries who receive federally-funded 
Medicaid services. It is incumbent upon the states to separate the data 
that they collect when submitting it to CMS. Any reliance interests 
with respect to the population of aliens who receive health benefits or 
services funded only by states are entitled to no weight since states 
are not required to submit this information to CMS.

VI. Additional Information

    Although notice and comment is unnecessary for this statement, CMS 
has been explicitly instructed by the district court in California v. 
HHS, No. 3:25-cv-05536 (N.D. Cal.), to address its reasons for forgoing 
notice and comment.
    As explained above, CMS's prior policy statement that it would not 
use CMS data or information for immigration enforcement purposes was 
made in the context of ICE's prior policy, as described in its 2013 
Policy Memorandum, to exercise its enforcement discretion to abstain 
from requesting information from CMS as the basis for pursuing a civil 
immigration enforcement action. CMS's prior policy statement did not 
change legal norms, as described above, created by Congress.
    This notice communicates a CMS policy that CMS will share certain 
information consistent with federal law authorizing such sharing with 
respect to requests for CMS information from DHS and ICE. CMS is 
accordingly updating its policy statement in this regard. CMS is 
publishing this notice solely to inform interested parties of its 
decision to provide information to ICE consistent with federal law. 
This is, at the most, a policy statement as defined by 5 U.S.C. 
553(b)(A) and (d)(2) and is exempt from notice and comment for that 
reason alone. See Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Ass'n, 575 U.S. 92, 95 
(2015) (not all rules must be issued through notice and comment, 
including interpretive rules and general statements of policy under 
section 4(b)(A) of the Administrative Procedure Act.).
    The Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
(CMS), Mehmet Oz, having reviewed and approved this document, 
authorizes Evell Barco Holland, who is the Federal Register Liaison, to 
electronically sign this document for purposes of publication in the 
Federal Register.
