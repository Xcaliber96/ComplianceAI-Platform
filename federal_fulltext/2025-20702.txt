sent via the U.S. Postal Service must be addressed to: Debbie-Anne A. 
Reese, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First 
Street NE, Room 1A, Washington, DC 20426. Submissions sent via any 
other carrier must be addressed to: Debbie-Anne A. Reese, Secretary, 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 12225 Wilkins Avenue, Rockville, 
MD 20852. All filings must clearly identify the project name and docket 
number on the first page: Pine Valley Hydroelectric Project (9282-040).
    m. The application is not ready for environmental analysis at this 
time.
    n. Project Description: The Pine Valley Hydroelectric Project 
includes a 200-foot-long, 23-foot-high stone-masonry gravity dam with a 
128-foot-long spillway. The dam is equipped with two waste gates and 
topped with 4-foot-high flashboards with a crest elevation of 323.6 
feet National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD 29) at the top of 
the flashboards. The dam creates an impoundment that has a surface area 
of 7 acres at 323.6 feet NGVD 29.
    From the impoundment, water flows into an intake structure located 
a short distance upstream of the dam on the eastern shoreline of the 
impoundment. The intake includes trashracks with 1.625-inch clear bar 
spacing and a gatehouse with an 8-foot-wide hydraulically operated 
headgate. From the intake, water flows through an 8-foot-diameter, 
approximately 0.5-mile-long penstock, directly to a 525-kilowatt 
horizontal Francis turbine-generator unit located on the lower level of 
a former mill building. Water is discharged from the turbine-generator 
unit to a 155-foot-long tailrace. The project creates an approximately 
3,258-foot-long bypassed reach.
    The project includes a downstream fish passage facility adjacent to 
the intake structure that consists of a surface inlet weir, a bypass 
inlet box, and a 24-inch diameter bypass pipe that discharges into the 
bypassed reach. The downstream fish passage facility operates annually 
from April 1 to June 1.
    Electricity generated by the turbine-generator unit is transmitted 
to the electric grid via a 200-foot-long, 4.16-kilovolt transmission 
line. The minimum and maximum hydraulic capacities of the turbine-
generator unit are 24 and 240 cubic feet per second (cfs), 
respectively. The average annual energy production of the project from 
2019 through 2024, was 1,458 megawatt-hours.
    The current license requires the project to operate in a run-of-
river mode such that project outflow approximates inflow to the 
impoundment. Pine Valley Hydro maintains the normal maximum surface 
elevation of the impoundment at 323.6 feet NGVD 29. The current license 
also requires Pine Valley Hydro to release a minimum flow of 24 cfs or 
inflow, whichever is less, from the project to the bypassed reach. The 
minimum flow is released either through a sluice gate adjacent to the 
spillway during project operation, over the spillway when not 
operating, or through the downstream fish passage facility from April 1 
to June 30.
    Pine Valley Hydro proposes to: (1) continue operating the project 
in a run-of-river mode; (2) increase the minimum flow from 24 cfs or 
inflow, whichever is less, to 50 cfs or inflow, whichever is less; (3) 
install a flow gage in the bypassed reach to monitor streamflow and 
project discharge; (4) continue operating the downstream fish passage 
facility from April 1 to June 1; (5) consult with resource agencies on 
the scope and schedule of any future eel passage protection measures 
that may be necessary; and (6) develop an operations compliance 
monitoring plan.
