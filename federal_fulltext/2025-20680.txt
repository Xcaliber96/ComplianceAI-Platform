    Abstract: The Secretary establishes regulations for Federal Pell 
Grants (Pell Grants or Pell) for Prison Education Programs (PEPs), to 
implement the statutory requirements in the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2021, that amend the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended 
(HEA), to establish Pell Grant eligibility for a confined or 
incarcerated individual enrolled in a PEP. These regulations are a 
result of negotiated rulemaking and added new title IV regulations to 
especially in Subpart P of 34 CFR 668. The Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2021 added section 484(t) to the HEA to formally establish Pell 
Grant eligibility for confined or incarcerated individuals, as long as 
they are enrolled in a PEP as defined under the HEA. The regulations 
implement the statutory requirements allowing access to Federal Pell 
Grants for individuals who are confined or incarcerated when enrolled 
in programs that meet necessary standards.
    This collection established the burden under regulations at 34 CFR 
668.237--Accreditation requirements. These regulations prescribe 
program evaluation at the first two additional Prison Education Program 
(PEP)

locations of a participating institution of higher education to ensure 
institutional ability to offer and implement the PEP in accordance with 
the accrediting agency's standards. The regulations require the 
accrediting agency to conduct a site visit no later than one year after 
the institution has initiated a PEP at its first two additional 
locations at correctional facilities. Additionally, the regulations 
require accrediting agencies to review the methodology used by an 
institution in determining the PEP meets the same standards for 
substantially similar non-PEP programs offered at the institution.

Chief Data Officer, Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy 
Development.
