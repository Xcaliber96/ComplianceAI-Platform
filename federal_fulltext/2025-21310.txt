II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. Chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a request for renewal of 
an existing collection of information to OMB for review entitled, 
``Exemptions and Continued Regulatory Authority in Agreement States and 
in Offshore Waters Under Section 274.'' The NRC hereby informs 
potential respondents that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and 
that a person is not required to respond to, a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on July 2, 2025, 90 FR 29054.
    1. The title of the information collection: 10 CFR part 150, 
``Exemptions and Continued Regulatory Authority in Agreement States and 
in Offshore Waters Under Section 274.''
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0032.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: One-time or 
as needed.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Agreement States who 
have signed section 274(b) Agreements with the NRC.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 9.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 9.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 190.5.
    10. Abstract: The NRC regulations in part 150 of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Exemptions and Continued 
Regulatory Authority in Agreement States and in Offshore Waters Under 
Section 274,'' provide certain exemptions to persons in Agreement 
States from the licensing requirements contained in Chapters 6, 7, and 
8 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and certain regulations 
of the Commission. The regulations in 10 CFR part 150 also define the 
Commission's continued regulatory authority over Agreement State 
activities which include byproduct, source, and special nuclear 
material reporting requirements related to reciprocity and enforcement. 
10 CFR part 150 requires telephonic notification to the NRC when an 
Agreement State licensee identifies attempted theft or diversion of 
special nuclear material, byproduct material, and tritium. This 
notification must be followed by a written report either 15 or 60 days 
after the initial report, depending on the materials involved. If 
additional information is available after submission of the written 
report, an additional report is submitted. These reports are used to 
inform the Commission, staff, and other Federal agencies when special 
nuclear material, byproduct material, or tritium is lost or stolen.

    Dated: November 24, 2025.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Heather Dempsey,
Acting NRC Clearance Officer, Office of the Chief Information Officer.
