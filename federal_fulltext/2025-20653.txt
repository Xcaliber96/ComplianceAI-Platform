SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), a 
Federal agency must receive approval from the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) before it collects certain information from the public, 
and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information 
by a Federal agency unless the collection displays a valid OMB control 
number. In compliance with these requirements, this notice announces 
that the following information collection request will be submitted to 
OMB.
    Title: Occupant Anthropometry and Seating.
    OMB Control Number: New.
    Form Number(s): NHTSA Form 1824, NHTSA Form 1825, NHTSA Form 1826, 
NHTSA Form 1827, NHTSA Form 1828, and NHTSA Form 1848.
    Type of Request: New information collection.
    Type of Review Requested: Regular.
    Requested Expiration Date of Approval: 3 years from date of 
approval.
    Summary of the Collection of Information: NHTSA proposes to collect 
information from the public as part of a study to update obsolete 
information on body size and shape, posture, and motion of vehicle 
occupants. This research will support NHTSA in the development of tools 
used for occupant protection during crashes, add to the body of 
knowledge, and inform future agency activities; however, it is not 
associated with immediate regulatory activities.
    The designs of anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs, commonly known 
as crash test dummies) are based on measurements of volunteers sitting 
in vehicle and laboratory seats. The current generation of ATDs is 
based on data gathered at University of Michigan Transportation 
Research Institute (UMTRI) in the 1980s. Since that time, the U.S. 
population has changed substantially, most notably due to the large 
increase in body mass. Measurement technologies have also improved 
dramatically with the development of fast three-dimensional surface 
measurement systems. Seating configurations have also expanded from the 
traditional seat posture collected in the 1980s with increased recline 
angles in modern vehicles. This combination of a population size shift 
and more variable seat configurations presents a clear need for updated 
seated anthropometry to be collected with new advanced anthropometry 
measurement capabilities.
    The individual data collections, approved by the Institutional 
Review Board at the University of Michigan, will each be performed 
once. Study participants will be male and female licensed adult drivers 
from the general public, and participation will be voluntary with 
compensation. For an in-lab study, the following information 
collections include (1) an online screening questionnaire; (2) a phone 
call to confirm eligibility, interest, and to schedule a time in the 
lab; and (3) informed consent for the in-lab study and anthropometric 
measurement. A subset of the in-lab participants will be asked to 
participate in an in-vehicle study to include (4) a pre-drive 
questionnaire for the in-vehicle study; (5) informed consent and 
anthropometric measurements for the in-vehicle study; and (6) a post-
drive questionnaire for the in-vehicle study.
    This research study will gather a new database of information on 
adult body size, shape, posture, and motion to support advancement in 
these safety applications. This study will add to the body of the 
knowledge on motor vehicle anthropometry and will support crash safety 
and occupant protection through the development of human body models 
(HBMs) and anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs).
    Description of the Need for the Information and Proposed Use of the 
Information: Early ATDs, including the Hybrid-III family that was 
initially designed in the 1970s, were constructed using manually 
gathered anthropometric data, such as segment lengths and 
circumferences. Minimal 3D information was available, and seated 
postures were approximated. In 1980, NHTSA funded a large-scale study 
at UMTRI to develop anthropometric specifications for a new generation 
of ATDs. The Anthropometry of Motor Vehicle Occupants (AMVO) study 
gathered data and developed detailed 3D body shapes for small female, 
midsize male, and large male occupants, using 5th percentile female, 
50th percentile male, and 95th percentile male stature and body weight 
as the target reference values. Drawing packages were developed 
detailing landmark and joint locations, and physical 3D surface shells 
were constructed using landmark data and minimal 3D contour 
information. These data have formed the anthropometric basis for most 
adult ATDs developed since that time.
    AMVO had some limitations, however. Due to the limits of the 
technology available at the time, a small number of participants were 
measured (25 per size bin were used to create the final 
specifications), and no 3D surface information was collected. Moreover, 
the analysis was based on simple averaging per size bins, so no 
information was provided for other occupant sizes. Additionally, the 
midsize female was dropped for cost reasons, so the only female data 
were gathered from very small individuals.
    Over the past 20 years, HBMs have become an important addition to 
the biomechanics toolkit. Using the same logic that was applied to 
selecting body sizes for ATDs, the HBMs have typically been targeted to 
the same stature and body weight reference values as were used in AMVO. 
However, unlike the averaging process used in AMVO, most HBMs have been 
developed using data primarily or entirely from a single individual. A 
consequence of this approach is that HBM development has not provided 
meaningful additions to the anthropometric data available to 
characterize vehicle occupants.
    In the decades since AMVO, UMTRI has conducted a large number of 
studies of occupant posture and body shape and has developed 
advancements in both measurement and analysis methodology. Of 
particular importance, rather than averaging data to create a 
representation of a single body size, UMTRI has developed continuous 
statistical models that can generate accurate specifications for a wide 
range of sizes and shapes (for examples, see <a href="http://HumanShape.org">http://HumanShape.org</a>). 
Simultaneously analyzing both landmark locations and 3D body shapes has 
enabled the development of

[[Page 53055]]

parametric human body modeling, in which HBMs are morphed to represent 
people with widely varying size and shape.
    Concurrent with the development of parametric HBMs, crash injury 
data analyses have highlighted the potential benefits of these new 
tools. In particular, the field data indicate that female occupants 
experience higher risks of some injuries in certain types of crashes. 
Notably, lower-extremity injury risks are markedly higher for female 
drivers than for male drivers in frontal impacts. Detailed 
anthropometric and posture data for female drivers could help to 
elucidate the causes of this difference. Crash injury data also show 
that individuals with high body mass are at higher risks of some 
injuries, possibly due to differences in the interaction with the 
restraint systems. Minimal data are available to describe the seated 
postures and body shapes of this cohort, which is increasingly 
important in the U.S.
    60-Day Notice: A Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period soliciting public comments on the following information 
collection was published on December 30, 2024 (89 FR 106741). During 
the public comment period for the 60-day notice, NHTSA received one 
comment from the Partnership for Dummy Technology and Biomechanics 
(PDB).
    NHTSA appreciates PDB's thoughtful and constructive engagement. PDB 
``highly appreciates the intension [sic] of NHTSA to update fundamental 
anthropometric data'' and provided detailed comments regarding (1) the 
study design, (2) the in-lab study, and (3) the in-vehicle study. NHTSA 
values the depth and thoroughness of PDB's input and has carefully 
considered their recommendations.
    Regarding the study design, PDB emphasized that participant body 
sizes should represent the overall population and recommended ensuring 
a sufficient number of participants at characteristic percentiles (5th, 
50th, and 95th) for males and females. They also recommended 
considering age alongside anthropometry because age influences seating 
position. NHTSA agrees with these points and the sample design will 
reflect selection criteria intended to ensure population representation 
and inclusion of specific characteristics. In a currently funded 
effort, UMTRI is reanalyzing data from over 400 seated subjects across 
varied anthropometries, sexes, and ages. Identified gaps and low sample 
sizes from these data were used to develop a participant recruitment 
matrix within a task implementation plan for this ICR. Participants 
will be 18 years of age and older, with ages distributed across three 
bins (20-39, 40-59, and 60-80 years). This collection aims to obtain 
about half the participants in the middle bin to address relatively 
small numbers of subjects in that age range in earlier studies. Stature 
will span from below the 5th percentile to above the 95th percentile 
for adult women and men in the U.S. population (1498 to 1875 mm). 
Recruitment will use three stature bins with approximately 2x 
oversampling in the tails to ensure robust statistical power for 
regression modeling. BMI will be sampled in three bins, with 50% of 
participants having BMI >30 kg/m2 (roughly 40% of U.S. adults) and 
about one-sixth with BMI >40. Age, stature, and BMI will be 
approximately independent, though exact equivalence of age 
distributions within bins may be constrained by sampling challenges.
    PDB recommended including second-row seat position measurements 
alongside driver and front passenger positions. NHTSA concurs that 
second-row positioning data are important. Although second-row seats 
are not included among the six mockup seats selected for in-lab data 
collection in the task implementation plan, the test conditions will 
incorporate fixed seat back angles typical of second- and third-row 
seats, including highly reclined conditions. NHTSA believes these test 
conditions address PDB's intent and satisfies their suggestion.
    PDB also suggested the in-vehicle study be conducted at a 
consistent time of day, preferably in the morning, to reduce spine 
relaxation effects from daily activities. NHTSA appreciates and 
understands the rationale behind this recommendation; however, due to 
time constraints and the large sample size required, the study cannot 
restrict data collection to a specific time of day. NHTSA does not 
expect this variation to have a significant impact on the data, but 
time of day can be considered as a covariate in analyses to clearly 
shed light on effects, if any.
    In discussion of the laboratory study, PDB highlighted the 
importance of manual data collection in addition to 3D scans and 
recommended collecting the same locations measured in the first AMVO 
study. NHTSA thanks PDB for this practical and helpful guidance and 
agrees with both recommendations. The study will incorporate 
comprehensive manual data collection of all locations from the first 
AMVO study alongside 3D scans. A complete list of measurement 
requirements is outlined in the task implementation plan with UMTRI and 
provided in Tables 1 and 2. These tables specify measurements to be 
gathered from each participant using standard manual anthropometry. 
Many additional dimensions can be extracted from the 3D scans beyond 
those listed. NHTSA intends to compare all new measurements from this 
study to prior AMVO measurements and will use both manual measures and 
3D scans to obtain comparable data.
    Table 2 lists the surface landmarks used to define posture and 
estimate internal joint center locations. All landmarks are measured in 
the laboratory hardseat, which provides access to both anterior and 
posterior landmarks; these data are used to create a subject-specific 
skeletal linkage that informs interpretation of vehicle seating 
conditions, where posterior landmarks below C7 are generally not 
accessible. Landmark locations, including points used to quantify belt 
fit, will be measured in the mockup conditions using the FARO Arm in a 
comparable manner. NHTSA is confident that the study design and 
measurement plan will fulfill PDB's request for thorough manual data 
collection.
    PDB provided a list of landmarks desired for Human Body Model (HBM) 
positioning. NHTSA appreciates these recommendations and will ensure 
the data collected under this ICR to provide sufficient landmark data 
for positioning and orienting both HBMs and ATDs. Body landmark data 
from the mockups will be analyzed using methods similar to those in 
prior UMTRI publications (e.g., Park et al., 2016). First, hardseat 
data will be used to estimate internal joint center locations and 
construct a skeletal linkage for each subject. Next, the skeletal 
linkage and surface landmarks will be used to estimate joint center 
locations in each mockup condition. Regression analysis will predict 
landmark locations as functions of subject characteristics (stature, 
BMI, etc.) and test condition variables (seat height, seat back angle, 
etc.). The VITUS laser scanner 3D data will be processed following 
established methods (e.g., Park et al., 2022): props (seats, handholds, 
etc.) are manually removed from the scan, an automatic surfacing 
process fills holes to obtain a watertight mesh, and texture data are 
used to manually digitize landmark locations in Meshlab. A standardized 
template is fitted to the mesh using UMTRI-developed methods. NHTSA is 
confident this collection will capture the landmark data discussed by 
PDB.

    PDB recommended measuring belt routing in mockup configurations. 
NHTSA will incorporate belt routing into the study design and 
appreciates PDB's emphasis on this point. In the task implementation 
plan, drivers will be measured in a core set of conditions (middle 
steering wheel position at three seat heights). A subset of 
participants will be assigned to a belt matrix in which belt fit is 
measured across a variety of belt anchorage locations, and another 
subset will be measured in the remaining package conditions.
    PDB also recommended collecting reclined postures with seat back 
angles up to around 45-50 degrees. NHTSA appreciates this 
recommendation and have included reclined postures up to 45 degrees in 
the task implementation plan. Posture will be measured using the FARO 
Arm at three seat back angles in each seat (20, 25, and 30 degrees) and 
at 35, 40, and 45 degrees for each participant in one randomly assigned 
seat (so highly reclined postures will be captured for approximately 
\1/6\ of participants in each seat). For postures reclined >30 degrees, 
NHTSA will use methods from Reed et al. (2019) to identify each 
participant's preferred supported head location. While PDB suggested 
angles up to about 50 degrees, NHTSA believes capturing up to 45 
degrees provides sufficient coverage for the intended analyses.
    PDB suggested that landmarks measured during the in-vehicle portion 
match in-lab landmarks whenever possible. NHTSA agrees and incorporated 
landmark matching efforts into the implementation plan. Because the ICR 
will recruit subjects from the in-lab study for the in-vehicle study, 
UMTRI will have comprehensive anthropometry and an accurate three-
dimensional, articulated avatar for each driver participant, enabling 
fitting to vehicle 3D data and accurate whole-body posture estimation. 
Seated posture, belt fit, and the position of selected vehicle 
components will be recorded using a FARO Arm coordinate measurement 
system and the vehicle DAS once participants are comfortably seated. 
PDB also recommended using the FMVSS 208 procedure to establish a 
consistent coordinate system. FMVSS 208 specifies the vehicle 
centerline at the rear bumper as the coordinate system origin; in this 
study, driver data will be defined in a package coordinate system 
anchored to the pedals and steering wheel so results are generalizable 
across vehicles. Seat back kinematics, including seat back angle 
change, will also be measured. These methods align with SAE and FMVSS 
practices. The collected seat H-point and vehicle interior dimensions 
will be sufficient to reproduce the package configuration in simulation 
or other physical mockups.
    Finally, PDB asked NHTSA to consider pressure distribution on the 
seat pan during static in-vehicle measurements. NHTSA appreciates the 
technical rationale for this suggestion but has determined that adding 
pressure distribution data collection would increase data collection 
efforts substantially and would be difficult to generalize because 
pressure maps depend heavily on seat design. Therefore, NHTSA will not 
add pressure distribution to this ICR. NHTSA published a 60-day notice 
on December 30, 2024, that stated NHTSA's intention to submit this ICR 
to OMB for approval (89 FR 106741).
    Affected Public: Respondents will be licensed drivers, ages 18+, in 
the Ann Arbor, MI region, and willing to travel to UMTRI. Study 
participants will be male and female licensed adult drivers from the 
general public, and participation will be voluntary with compensation. 
The screening questionnaire is provided as a Google Form through the 
University of Michigan's Health Research portal and is completed online 
by prospective participants. Eligible participants are those whose 
answers to the Google Form questions are consistent with the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria.
    Eligibility requirements include the ability to read and speak 
English, to drive for two hours continuously, hold a current and 
unrestricted U.S. driver's license, have at least one year as a 
licensed driver, drive a car daily for an average of at least 15 
minutes, and be comfortable driving on the highway and local roads. 
Exclusion criteria include individuals with musculoskeletal ailments, 
impeding the ability to walk or sit comfortably, or musculoskeletal 
deformities such as scoliosis or amputations.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 2,000. We estimate that 2,000 
screening questionnaires will be filled out to obtain the needed number 
of subjects. The form has 23 questions, including name, address, and 
time slots available. We estimate that up to 600 individuals will need 
to be contacted to obtain the needed number of 300 subjects for the lab 
study. This considers that some people's schedules may not match up 
with lab openings or they may not show up for their scheduled 
appointment. A subset of the in-lab study participants will be asked to 
participate in the in-vehicle study with the targeted 100 participants.
    Frequency: Once. This is a one-time collection of information with 
two studies: in-lab and in-vehicle. A subset

[[Page 53057]]

of the in-lab participants will be asked to participate in the in-
vehicle study. The initial pre-screening time is roughly 5 minutes and 
can be done at the respondents' convenience using a device of their 
choosing. The only requirement is an internet connection to access the 
online pre-screening. Not all who begin this pre-screening will 
complete the form in its entirety, and not everyone will meet study 
criteria. Those who meet study criteria could be contacted for an 
eligibility phone call prior to study enrollment.
    Number of Responses: 2,000. Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 
The annual estimated time burden to complete the collection of 
information is 341 hours and an annual opportunity cost of $11,329 over 
the study period. Note that these figures are slightly less than those 
posted in the 60-day notice for this information collection. The 60-day 
notice overestimated the total time per response for the entirety of 
the in-vehicle study, which is corrected herein. Further, the 60-day 
notice included a private industry workers' wage adjustment, which has 
since been deemed unnecessary for this information collection's burden 
estimates, as participants are engaging on their own time as volunteers 
for all aspects of this study. Therefore, this monetary adjustment to 
the opportunity cost per hour has been omitted.
    Using the University of Michigan's Health Research portal, the 
research team expects to have 2,000 participants respond to the 
screening questionnaire in total. Across the three years of the study 
collection, NHTSA estimates 667 respondents for the screening 
questionnaire. A complete questionnaire is estimated at 5 minutes. Of 
the screened individuals, we anticipate that up to 600 total (200 
annually) will need to be contacted for an eligibility phone call to 
obtain the needed number of 300 total participants (100 annually) 
scheduled for the in-lab study. Scheduled participants who do not show 
up will be replaced from the remaining pool of screened participants to 
ensure a total of 300 total participants (100 annually) arrive for in-
lab measurements. After completion of the 2-hour process for informed 
consented and in-lab data collection, some participants will be asked 
if they are interested in the in-vehicle study. From the 300 total in-
lab participants, a total of 100 (34 annually) will be scheduled to 
return to the lab for the in-vehicle study. The in-vehicle pre-drive 
and post-drive questionnaires will each take 5 minutes, the informed 
consent and anthropometric measurements will take 10 minutes, and the 
vehicle drive itself will take 100 minutes, totaling 2 hours for the 
entirety of the in-vehicle study.
    To calculate the opportunity cost associated with the forms and 
other relevant activities necessary for this collection of new 
information, NHTSA looked at average hourly earnings for employees 
across all occupations in the Ann Arbor, MI area. The Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS) estimates that the average hourly wage for this group 
is $33.43, thus serving as the opportunity cost per hour. NHTSA 
therefore estimates the total opportunity cost associated with the 
1,017 burden hours to be $33,989. Annual burden cost is estimated to be 
$11,329, and annual burden hours are estimated to be 341. There may be 
a slight variation in the comparison of total to annual burden over the 
three years due to rounding. The annual burden figures will be those 
represented in ROCIS.
