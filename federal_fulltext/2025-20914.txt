Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

[Docket No. CP25-10-000[


Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC; Notice of 
Availability of the Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Southeast 
Supply Enhancement Project

    The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or 
Commission) has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for the 
Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (Project), proposed by 
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) in the above-
referenced docket.\1\ Transco requests authorization to construct, 
modify, and operate facilities along its existing pipeline system in 
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, to 
provide 1,596,900 dekatherms per day of year-round firm transportation 
service to the southeastern United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For tracking purposes under the National Environmental 
Policy Act, the unique identification number for documents relating 
to this environmental review is EAXX-019-20-000-1732530814.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FERC is the lead federal agency for authorizing interstate natural 
gas transmission facilities under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and 
the lead federal agency for preparation of the EA. The EA assesses the 
potential environmental effects of the Project in accordance with the 
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) \2\ and 
the Commission's implementing regulations.\3\ The principal purposes of 
the EA are to: identify and assess the potential effects on the natural 
and human environment; describe and evaluate reasonable alternatives; 
identify and recommend mitigation measures; and facilitate public 
involvement in the environmental review process. The EA concludes that 
approval of the Project would not constitute a major federal

[[Page 53288]]

action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended 
(Public Law [Pub. L.] 91-190. 42 United States Code [U.S.C.] 4321-
4347, as amended by Pub. L. 94-52, July 3, 1975; Pub. L. 94-83, 
August 9, 1975; Pub. L. 97-258, 4(b), September 13, 1982; Pub. L. 
118-5, June 3, 2023; Pub. L. 119-21, July 4, 2025).
    \3\ 18 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 380.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Norfolk District and the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Virginia Ecological Services Field 
Office participated as cooperating agencies in the preparation of the 
EA. Cooperating agencies have jurisdiction by law or special expertise 
with respect to resources potentially affected by the proposal and 
participate in the NEPA analysis. The USACE has authority under section 
404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate the discharge of dredged 
or fill materials into Waters of the United States, as well as sections 
10 and 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act.\4\ The EA addresses 
environmental effects associated with the subject Project as it relates 
to these statutes, but it does not serve as a public notice for any 
USACE permit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The USACE's regulations for permits under section 10 of the 
Rivers and Harbors Act (33 U.S.C. 403) can be found at 33 CFR 322, 
while regulations for permits under section 404 of the CWA are at 33 
CFR 323 and processing of permits is at 33 CFR 325.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The mission of the FWS is to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, 
wildlife, and plants and their habitats. Toward that goal, the FWS 
works to enforce federal wildlife laws, protect endangered species, 
manage migratory birds, conserve habitats including wetlands, and 
restore fisheries. FERC is required to consult with the FWS under 
section 7 of the Endangered Species Act to determine whether any 
federally listed or proposed endangered or threatened species or their 
designated critical habitats would be affected by the Project. The EA 
addresses this required consultation.
    The Southeast Supply Enhancement Project would consist of:
    <bullet> Construction of about 31.2 miles of 42-inch-diameter 
pipeline loop with four mainline valves in Pittsylvania County, 
Virginia, and Rockingham County, North Carolina, designated as the Eden 
Loop.
    <bullet> Construction of about 24.2 miles of 42-inch-diameter 
pipeline loop with six mainline valves in Guilford, Forsyth, and 
Davidson Counties, North Carolina, designated as the Salem Loop.
    <bullet> Regulator installation in Rockingham County, North 
Carolina, designated as the Eden Regulator Station.
    <bullet> Construction of about 294 feet of 30-inch-diameter 
pipeline and ancillary valves in Rockingham County, North Carolina, 
designated as the Dan River Inlet Piping.
    <bullet> Addition of compressor units at Transco's existing 
Compressor Stations 165 in Pittsylvania County, Virginia; 155 in 
Davidson County, North Carolina; and 150 in Iredell County, North 
Carolina.
    <bullet> Replacement of three existing compressor units with larger 
compressor units at Transco's existing Compressor Station 145 in 
Cleveland County, North Carolina.
    <bullet> Modifications to valve controls at existing mainline 
valves in Lincoln and Gaston Counties, North Carolina.
    <bullet> Piping modifications at Transco's existing Compressor 
Stations 135 in Anderson County, South Carolina; 125 in Walton County, 
Georgia; and 105 in Coosa County, Alabama.
    <bullet> Regulator installation and piping modifications at 
Transco's existing Compressor Station 120 in Henry County, Georgia.
    The Commission mailed a copy of the Notice of Availability of the 
Environmental Assessment for the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project 
to federal, state, and local government representatives and agencies; 
elected officials; environmental and public interest groups; Native 
American tribes; potentially affected landowners and other interested 
individuals and groups; and newspapers and libraries in the Project 
area. The EA is available only in electronic format. It may be viewed

    The EA is not a decision document. It presents Commission staff's 
independent analysis of the environmental issues for the Commission to 
consider when addressing the merits of all issues in this proceeding. 
Under section 7(c) of the NGA, the Commission determines whether 
interstate natural gas transportation facilities are in the public 
convenience and necessity and, if so, grants a Certificate of Public 
Convenience and Necessity to construct and operate them. Section 7(b) 
of the NGA specifies that no natural gas company shall abandon any 
portion of its facilities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction 
without the Commission first finding that the abandonment will not 
negatively affect the present or future public convenience and 
necessity. The Commission bases its decisions on both economic issues, 
including need, and environmental effects.
    Any person wishing to comment on the EA may do so. Your comments 
should focus on the EA's disclosure and discussion of potential 
environmental effects, reasonable alternatives, and measures to avoid 
or lessen environmental effects. The more specific your comments, the 
more useful they will be. To ensure that the Commission has the 
opportunity to consider your comments prior to making its decision on 
this project, it is important that the Commission receives your 
comments in Washington, DC on or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 
December 1, 2025.
    The EA also includes site-specific construction plans for 
residences within 50 feet of Project workspaces (see appendix D); 
affected landowners are encouraged to review these plans and provide 
comments within the comment period described above.
    For your convenience, there are three methods you can use to file 
your comments to the Commission. The Commission encourages electronic 
filing of comments and has staff available to assist you at (866) 208-

Only intervenors have the right to seek rehearing or judicial review of 
the Commission's decision. At this point in this proceeding, the 
timeframe for filing timely intervention requests has expired. Any 
person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion 
to intervene out-of-time pursuant to Rule 214(b)(3) and (d) of the 
Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures (18 Code of Federal 
Regulations 385.214(b)(3) and (d)) and show good cause why the time 
limitation should be waived. Motions to intervene are more fully 
described at <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/how-intervene">https://www.ferc.gov/how-intervene</a>.
