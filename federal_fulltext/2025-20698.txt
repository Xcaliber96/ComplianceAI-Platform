DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

[Docket No. CP25-528-000]


Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc; Notice of Schedule for 
the Preparation of an Environmental Assessment for the Appalachian 
Reliability Project

    On July 24, 2025, Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. (EGTS) 
filed an application in Docket No. CP25-528-000 requesting a 
Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity pursuant to Section 
7(c) of the Natural Gas Act to construct and operate certain natural 
gas pipeline facilities. The proposed project is known as the 
Appalachian Reliability Project (Project) and would allow EGTS to 
provide about 550,000 dekatherms per day of additional firm natural gas 
transportation service to points along the interstate pipeline grid in 
Ohio and Pennsylvania.
    On August 7, 2025, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
(Commission or FERC) issued its Notice of Application for the Project. 
Among other things, that notice alerted agencies issuing federal 
authorizations of the requirement to complete all necessary reviews and 
to reach a final decision on a request for a federal authorization 
within 90 days of the date of issuance of the Commission staff's 
environmental document for the Project.
    This notice identifies Commission staff's intention to prepare an 
environmental assessment (EA) for the Project and the planned schedule 
for the completion of the environmental review.\1\ The EA will be 
issued for a 30-day comment period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For tracking purposes under the National Environmental 
Policy Act, the unique identification number for documents relating 
to this environmental review is EA-XX-019-20-000-1756811530.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Schedule for Environmental Review

Issuance of EA February 27, 2026
90-day Federal Authorization Decision Deadline \2\ May 28, 2026
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The Commission's deadline applies to the decisions of other 
federal agencies, and state agencies acting under federally 
delegated authority, that are responsible for federal 
authorizations, permits, and other approvals necessary for proposed 
projects under the Natural Gas Act. Per 18 CFR 157.22(a), the 
Commission's deadline for other agency's decisions applies unless a 
schedule is otherwise established by federal law.

    If a schedule change becomes necessary, additional notice will be 
provided so that the relevant agencies are kept informed of the 
Project's progress.

Project Description

    EGTS proposes to construct and operate about 3.9 miles of 
interstate natural gas transmission pipeline and modify its existing 
compression and metering regulation facilities in Armstrong, Greene and 
Westmoreland Counties, Pennsylvania, and Monroe County, Ohio.

Background

    On September 4, 2025, the Commission issued a Notice of Scoping 
Period Requesting Comments on Environmental Issues for the Proposed 
Appalachian Reliability Project (Notice of Scoping). The Notice of 
Scoping was sent to affected landowners; federal, state, and local 
government agencies; elected officials; environmental and public 
interest groups; Native American tribes; other interested parties; and 
local libraries and newspapers. Prior to issuing the Notice of Scoping, 
we received numerous comments supporting the Project. In response to 
the Notice of Scoping, we received eight comments. We received comments 
from three landowners, two non-profit organizations; Protect PT (Penn-
Trafford) and the Clean Air Council, the Teamsters National Pipeline 
Labor Management Cooperation Trust, the Energy Equipment and 
Infrastructure Alliance, and the Monroe County, OH Board of County 
Commissioners. The primary issues raised by the commenters concern 
noise and air emissions from the JB Tonkin Compressor Station and their 
effects on air quality, nearby residences, and public health, the 
Project's potential effects on agricultural and livestock lands and 
business operations, streams and wetlands, and federally protected 
threatened and endangered species. We also received comments concerning 
the purpose and need for the Project, environmental justice, past EGTS' 
air permit compliance issues, and alternatives. Lastly, we received a 
request to hold in-person public scoping sessions. Given the limited 
scope of the Project, we determined that our solicitation of written 
comments was sufficient. The Teamsters National Pipeline Labor 
Management Cooperation Trust, the Energy Equipment and Infrastructure 
Alliance, and the Monroe County, OH Board of County Commissioners all 
submitted comments supporting the Project. All substantive comments 
will be addressed in the EA.

Additional Information
