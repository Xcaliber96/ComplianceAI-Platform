SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521), Federal 
Agencies must obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) for each collection of information they conduct or sponsor. 
``Collection of information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 
1320.3(c) and includes Agency requests or requirements that members of 
the public submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a 
third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)) 
requires Federal Agencies to provide a 60-day notice in the Federal 
Register concerning each proposed collection of information, including 
each proposed extension of an existing collection of information, 
before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To comply with 
this requirement, FDA is publishing notice of the proposed collection 
of information set forth in this document.
    With respect to the following collection of information, FDA 
invites comments on these topics: (1) whether the proposed collection 
of information is necessary for the proper performance of FDA's 
functions, including whether the information will have practical 
utility; (2) the accuracy of FDA's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways 
to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, 
including through the use of automated collection techniques, when 
appropriate, and other forms of information technology.

Human Drug Compounding Under Sections 503A and 503B of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

OMB Control Number 0910-0800--Extension

    This information collection helps support the implementation of 
sections 503A and 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 353a and 353b); Pharmacy Compounding and 
Outsourcing Facilities. Compounding is generally a practice in which a 
licensed pharmacist, a licensed physician, or, in the case of an 
outsourcing facility, a person under the supervision of a licensed 
pharmacist, combines, mixes, or alters ingredients of a drug to create 
a medication tailored to the needs of an individual patient. Although 
compounded drugs can serve an important medical need for certain 
patients, they also present risk. Our compounding program aims to 
protect patients from unsafe, ineffective, and poor quality compounded 
drugs, while preserving access to lawfully-marketed compounded drugs 
for patients who have a medical need for them.
    Respondents to the information collection are those engaged in the 
practice of pharmacy compounding. The information collection is 
intended to account for burden attributable to activities pertaining to 
the registration of outsourcing facilities and reporting of drugs, as 
established in sections 503B(b)(1) through 503B(b)(3) of the FD&C Act. 
Additionally, the information collection is intended to account for 
burden attributable to activities associated with the submission of 
adverse event reports, as required under section 503B(b)(5) of the FD&C 
Act. Finally, the information collection is intended to account for 
burden attributable to activities associated with States entering into 
memoranda of understanding with the Secretary, as described in section 
503A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act.
    To help respondents understand statutory requirements applicable to 
compounding activities governed by the

[[Page 52967]]

FD&C Act, we have developed the following topical guidance documents:
    <bullet> ``Electronic Drug Product Reporting for Human Drug 
Compounding Outsourcing Facilities Under Section 503B of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act'' (January 3, 2017), available on our 
website at <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/90173/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/90173/download</a>. The guidance is 
intended for entities that compound human drugs and elect to register 
as outsourcing facilities under section 503B of the FD&C Act. Once an 
entity has elected to register as an outsourcing facility, it must 
submit reports identifying the drugs compounded by the outsourcing 
facility. The guidance describes who must report, the format of the 
report, the content to include in each report, when to report, how 
outsourcing facilities may submit reports to FDA, and the consequences 
of outsourcing facilities' failure to submit reports.
    <bullet> ``Adverse Event Reporting for Outsourcing Facilities Under 
Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act'' (October 8, 
2015), available at <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/90997/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/90997/download</a>.
    The guidance documents were issued consistent with FDA's good 
guidance practice regulations in 21 CFR 10.115, which provide for 
public comment at any time.
    We estimate the burden of this collection of information as 
follows:
