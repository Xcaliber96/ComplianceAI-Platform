[Docket No. RM98-1-000]


Records Governing Off-the-Record Communications Public Notice

    This constitutes notice, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.2201(b), of 
the receipt of prohibited and exempt off-the-record communications.
    Order No. 607 (64 FR 51222, September 22, 1999) requires Commission 
decisional employees, who make or receive a prohibited or exempt off-
the-record communication relevant to the merits of a contested 
proceeding, to deliver to the Secretary of the Commission, a copy of 
the communication, if written, or a summary of the substance of any 
oral communication.
    Prohibited communications are included in a public, non-decisional 
file associated with, but not a part of, the decisional record of the 
proceeding. Unless the Commission determines that the prohibited 
communication and any responses thereto should become a part of the 
decisional record, the prohibited off-the-record communication will not 
be considered by the Commission in reaching its decision. Parties to a 
proceeding may seek the opportunity to respond to any facts or 
contentions made in a prohibited off-the-record communication and may 
request that the Commission place the prohibited communication and 
responses thereto in the decisional record. The Commission will grant 
such a request only when it determines that fairness so requires. Any 
person identified below as having made a prohibited off-the-record 
communication shall serve the document on all parties listed on the 
official service list for the applicable proceeding in accordance with 
Rule 2010, 18 CFR 385.2010.
    Exempt off-the-record communications are included in the decisional 
record of the proceeding, unless the communication was with a 
cooperating agency as described by 40 CFR 1501.6, made under 18 CFR 
385.2201(e)(1)(v).
    The following is a list of off-the-record communications recently 
received by the Secretary of the Commission. Each filing may be viewed 
on the Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ferc.gov">http://www.ferc.gov</a> using the eLibrary
