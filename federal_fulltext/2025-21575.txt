Overview of This Information Collection

    1. Type of Information Collection: Revision to currently approved 
collection.
    2. Title of the Form/Collection: Juvenile Facility Census Program 
(JFCP).
    3. Agency form number, if any, and the applicable component of the 
Department of Justice sponsoring the collection: The form numbers are 
CJ-14 (Youth Characteristics Module) and CJ-15 (Facility Operations 
Module). The applicable components within the Department of Justice are 
the National Institute of Justice and the Office of Juvenile Justice 
and Delinquency Prevention, in the Office of Justice Programs.

well as a brief abstract: State, local and tribal governments,

    Abstract: This request for clearance of the Juvenile Facility 
Census Program (JFCP) will combine two previously, separately cleared 
data collections: the Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement 
(CJRP, OMB # 1121-0218) and the Juvenile Residential Facility Census 
(JRFC, OMB # 1121-0219). The JFCP collects information from all secure 
and nonsecure residential placement facilities that house persons 
younger than age 21 who are being held as a result of some contact with 
the juvenile justice system for a law violation. This encompasses both 
status offenses and delinquency offenses and includes youth who are 
either temporarily detained by the court or committed after 
adjudication for an offense. The JFCP consolidates the content of the 
CJRP and JRFC into a single, unified program. It collects general 
information on facility characteristics and the number of youth housed, 
and includes two rotating content modules that are administered 
separately during a two-year collection cycle: the Youth Population 
module and the Facility Operations module. The Youth Population module 
collects detailed information on individual youth housed in facilities, 
including demographic details, placement characteristics, and length of 
stay. The Facility Operations module collects information on resident 
services, facility features, and operations. The information gathered 
in these national collections will be used in published reports and 
statistics. The reports will be made available to the U.S. Congress, 
Executive Office of the President, practitioners, researchers, 
students, the media, others interested in juvenile residential 
facilities, and the general public via the OJP agency websites. The two 
data collections are being consolidated the attain cost savings and 
reduce respondent burden.
    5. Obligation to Respond: Voluntary.
    6. Total Estimated Number of Respondents: The total estimated 
respondents is 1,636 for each module for each year.
    7. Estimated Time per Respondent: It takes an average of 6 hours to 
complete the JFCP. The total burden is 9,816, including the two 
rotating content modules that are administered separately during a two-
year collection cycle. The Youth Characteristics module takes an 
average of 4 hours to complete. The total burden for the Youth 
Characteristics module is 6,544 hours. The Facility Operations module 
takes an average of 2 hours to complete. The total burden for the 
Facility Operations module is 3,272 hours.
    8. Frequency: The JFCP is a biennial data collection with two 
content modules administered separately during a two-year collection 
cycle.
    9. Total Estimated Annual Time Burden: The average annual burden is 
4,908 or 9,816 total hours for the two-year collection cycle.
    10. Total Estimated Annual Other Costs Burden: The estimated annual 
cost for JFCP is $1,142,115. The estimated cost for one collection 
cycle is $2,284,230.
