21 CFR Part 876

[Docket No. FDA-2025-N-4645]


Medical Devices; Gastroenterology-Urology Devices; Classification 
of the Anchored Esophageal Sheath

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Final amendment; final order.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is 
classifying the anchored esophageal sheath into class II (special 
controls). The special controls that apply to the device type are 
identified in this order and will be part of the codified language for 
the classification of the anchored esophageal sheath. We are taking 
this action because we have determined that classifying the device into 
class II (special controls) will

[[Page 54231]]

provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the 
device. We believe this action will also enhance patients' access to 
beneficial innovative devices, in part by reducing regulatory burdens.

DATES: This order is effective November 26, 2025. The classification 
was applicable on April 16, 2019.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    Upon request, FDA has classified the anchored esophageal sheath as 
class II (special controls), which we have determined will provide a 
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for its intended use. 
In addition, we believe this action will enhance patients' access to 
beneficial innovation, in part by reducing regulatory burdens by 
placing the device into the appropriate device class based on risk and 
the regulatory controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of 
safety and effectiveness.
    FDA may classify a device through an accessory classification 
request under section 513(f)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360c(f)(6)), established by section 707 of 
the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (Pub. L. 115-52). The provision 
allows manufacturers or importers to request classification of an 
accessory distinct from another device upon written request. The 
classification is based on the risks of the accessory when used as 
intended as well as the level of regulatory controls necessary to 
provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, 
notwithstanding the classification of any other device with which such 
accessory is intended to be used. Until an accessory is reclassified by 
FDA, the classification of any accessory distinct from another device 
by regulation or written order issued prior to December 13, 2016, will 
continue to apply.
    Under section 513(f)(6)(D)(ii) of the FD&C Act, a manufacturer or 
importer may request appropriate classification of an accessory that 
has been granted marketing authorization as part of a premarket 
approval application (PMA), premarket notification (510(k)), or De Novo 
classification request. FDA must grant or deny the request not later 
than 85 days after receipt and, if granting, publish a notice in the 
Federal Register within 30 days of announcing the classification.
    Alternatively, under section 513(f)(6)(C) of the FD&C Act, a person 
filing a PMA or 510(k) may include a written request for the proper 
classification of an accessory that has not been classified distinctly 
from another device based on the risks of the accessory when used as 
intended and the level of regulatory controls necessary to provide a 
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. When the written 
request is included in a submission for marketing authorization, FDA 
must grant or deny the request along with the response to the PMA or 
510(k). Upon granting, FDA will publish a notice in the Federal 
Register within 30 days of announcing the classification.

II. Accessory Classification

    On July 9, 2018, FDA received BAROnova, Inc.'s request for 
accessory classification of the BAROnova Access Sheath. FDA reviewed 
the request in order to classify the device under the criteria for 
classification set forth in section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act.
    We classify devices into class II if general controls by themselves 
are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and 
effectiveness, but there is sufficient information to establish special 
controls that, in combination with the general controls, provide 
reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for 
its intended use (see section 513(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act). After 
review of the information submitted in the request, we determined that 
the device can be classified into class II with the establishment of 
special controls. FDA has determined that these special controls, in 
addition to the general controls, will provide reasonable assurance of 
the safety and effectiveness of the device.
    Therefore, on April 16, 2019, FDA issued an order to the requester 
classifying the device into class II. In this final order, FDA is 
codifying the classification of the device by adding 21 CFR 
876.1510.\1\ We have named the generic type of device ``anchored 
esophageal sheath,'' and it is identified as a device used to provide 
an endoluminal pathway to facilitate insertion of an endoscope or other 
compatible device into the upper gastrointestinal tract. A distal 
anchor assists in keeping the sheath in place to facilitate positioning 
of the endoscope or other compatible device.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ FDA notes that the ACTION caption for this final order is 
styled as ``Final amendment; final order,'' rather than ``Final 
order.'' Beginning in December 2019, this editorial change was made 
to indicate that the document ``amends'' the Code of Federal 
Regulations. The change was made in accordance with the Office of 
Federal Register's (OFR) interpretations of the Federal Register Act 
(44 U.S.C. chapter 15), its implementing regulations (1 CFR 5.9 and 
parts 21 and 22), and the Document Drafting Handbook.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FDA has identified the following risks to health associated 
specifically with this type of device and the measures required to 
mitigate these risks in table 1.

    Table 1--Anchored Esophageal Sheath Risks and Mitigation Measures

    <bullet> Retraction of anchoring
     component against GEJ.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FDA has determined that special controls, in combination with the 
general controls, address these risks to health and provide reasonable 
assurance of safety and effectiveness. For a device to fall within this 
classification, and

[[Page 54232]]

thus avoid automatic classification in class III, it would have to 
comply with the special controls named in this final order. The 
necessary special controls appear in the regulation codified by this 
final order. This device is subject to premarket notification 
requirements under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)).
    Section 510(m) of the FD&C Act provides that FDA may exempt a class 
II device from the premarket notification requirements under section 
510(k) if, after notice of our intent to exempt and consideration of 
comments, we determine that premarket notification is not necessary to 
provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device. 
At a future date, we may publish a separate notice in the Federal 
Register announcing our intent to exempt this device type.

III. Analysis of Environmental Impact

    The Agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.34(b) that this action is 
of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant 
effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental 
assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.

IV. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995

    This final order establishes special controls that refer to 
previously approved collections of information found in other FDA 
regulations and guidance. These collections of information are subject 
to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521). The collections 
of information in 21 CFR part 860, subpart D, regarding De Novo 
classification have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0844; 
the collections of information in the guidance document ``Medical 
Device Accessories--Describing Accessories and Classification 
Pathways'' have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0823; the 
collections of information in part 814, subparts A through E, regarding 
premarket approval have been approved under OMB control number 0910-
0231; the collections of information in part 820 regarding quality 
system regulation have been approved under OMB control number 0910-
0073; the collections of information in part 807, subpart E, regarding 
premarket notification submissions have been approved under OMB control 
number 0910-0120; and the collections of information in part 801 
regarding labeling have been approved under OMB control number 0910-
0485.
