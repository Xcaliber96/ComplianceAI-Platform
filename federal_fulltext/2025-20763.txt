Determination of Size Standard Review

AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

ACTION: Notice of determination.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This action serves as notice that NMFS has determined, after 
review consistent with NMFS' small business size standards regulations, 
the U.S. Small Business Administration's review requirements under the 
Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, the Small Business Administration's 
regulations establishing size standards, and Small Business 
Administration's size standards methodology, the NMFS-established and 
codified single small business size standard of $11 million in annual 
gross receipts for all businesses in the commercial fishing industry 
continues to reflect the size distribution of all businesses in the 
commercial fishing industry and is appropriate for continued use for 
Regulatory Flexibility Act purposes only. Therefore, no revision to the 
standard is warranted at this time.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 29, 2015, the National Marine 
Fisheries Service (NMFS) issued a final rule establishing a single 
small business size standard of $11 million in annual gross receipts 
for all businesses primarily engaged in the commercial fishing industry 
(North American Industry Classification System [NAICS] 11411) for 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) compliance purposes only (80 FR 81194, 
December 29, 2015) (see 50 CFR 200.2). For the purposes of the rule, a 
``commercial fishing business'' is a business primarily engaged in 
commercial fishing, the ``commercial fishing industry'' is composed of 
all such businesses, and the $11 million standard only applies to this 
industry (Idem at 81194). The standard is used in place of the U.S. 
Small Business Administration's (SBA) current standards of $25 million, 
$14 million, and $11.5 million for the finfish (NAICS 114111), 
shellfish (NAICS 114112), and other marine fishing (NAICS 114119) 
sectors of the U.S. commercial fishing industry in all NMFS rules 
subject to the RFA after July 1, 2016. This standard does not apply to 
businesses primarily engaged in seafood processing (NAICS 311170), 
seafood wholesale activities (NAICS 424460), or any other activity 
within the seafood industry. Under the RFA, an agency must prepare an 
initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA/FRFA) for each 
proposed and final rule, respectively, unless it certifies that a rule 
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
small entities. Agencies generally rely on the SBA size standards to 
identify small entities for RFA purposes. For NMFS, rulemaking 
activities that may be impacted by changes to the size standards for 
defining ``small'' businesses include, but are not limited to, 
regulatory actions and analyses undertaken pursuant to the Magnuson-
Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act Endangered Species Act 
Marine Mammal Protection Act and National Environmental Policy Act.
    Consistent with NMFS' small business size standards regulations (50 
CFR 200.2), SBA's review requirements under the Small Business Jobs Act 
of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-240, 124 Stat. 2504, Sept. 27, 2010 regulations 
establishing size standards (13 CFR 121.102), and SBA's Size Standards 
Methodology (available at <a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/support-2024-size-standards-methodology-white-paper">https://www.sba.gov/document/support-2024-size-standards-methodology-white-paper</a> and noticed in 89 FR 74109), 
NMFS reviews this standard at least once every 5 years to determine if 
a change is warranted. A change may be warranted because of changes in 
industry structure, market conditions, inflation, or other relevant 
factors (50 CFR 200.2(b)). NMFS reviews all of the applicable factors 
simultaneously as part of its size standard review, in order to 
minimize the frequency of changes to the standard and the need for 
additional rulemakings.

Review Methodology

    In establishing the $11 million size standard during 2015, NMFS 
determined that the data used by SBA to develop size standards were not 
representative of all commercial fishing businesses. Specifically, in 
establishing commercial fishing size standards during 2013 (78 FR 
37198, June 20, 2013), SBA relied primarily on specialized tabulations 
from the U.S. Census Bureau's economic census. The sample frame for the 
economic census and related Census Bureau data such as County Business 
Patterns or Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages from the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics (BLS) are for establishments or firms that are subject 
to payroll tax. While some commercial fishing businesses do have wage-
based employees, remuneration for the majority of commercial fishing 
business crew is based on a share of total revenue on each fishing 
trip. For

[[Page 52918]]

this reason, commercial fishing crew are considered co-ventures or sole 
proprietorships and not subject to payroll tax, which means that the 
majority of fishing businesses do not have wage-based employees.
    Given the determination that the data used by SBA were not 
representative of how fishing businesses operate, NMFS used available 
Census Bureau data for the limited number of commercial fishing 
businesses that did have wage-based employees and requested specialized 
data from the Census Bureau's non-employer series. The non-employer 
series includes any commercial fishing establishment or individual that 
files income tax (e.g., Schedule C) and that does not report any paid 
employees. These data were combined with the data for wage-based 
commercial fishing businesses to establish a single size standard of 
$11 million solely for purposes of conducting NMFS' regulatory analyses 
under the RFA (80 FR 81194, December 29, 2015).
    Since 2015, the SBA changed the methods for determining size 
standards from an anchor-based size standard to one in which industry 
factors are ranked relative to the 20th and 80th percentile within a 
group of industries. The revised SBA methodology was published in 2019 
and then updated in 2024. Additionally, the SBA changed the basis for 
calculating receipts-based size standards from a 3-year to a 5-year 
average (84 FR 66561, December 5, 2019). In addressing these changes, 
NMFS has determined that commercial fishing revenue reported through 
NMFS seafood dealers or first-receivers would be the best available 
data upon which to update the commercial fishing size standard. All 
commercial fishing businesses that fish in the U.S. Exclusive Economic 
Zone (EEZ) waters are required to have a Federal permit, which also 
carries a requirement to report commercial fishing landings and revenue 
through a NMFS dealer reporting or a trip-ticket system. This means 
that the NMFS commercial fishing receipts data would include both 
entities that have wage-based employees and some but not all 
establishments included in the Census Bureau's non-employer series. The 
non-employer series includes establishments that own fishing vessels 
but also includes individuals who fish from shore, as well as fishing 
crew, who would not be included in the commercial fishing receipts 
data. This creates uncertainty over whether or not an establishment is 
a ``small business concern,'' as defined under the RFA and over the 
number of non-employer establishments that would not be directly 
regulated by NMFS's actions, and therefore, would not be counted for 
RFA purposes, because they fish exclusively in State waters. By 
contrast, the NMFS data focuses on commercial fishing businesses that 
are most likely to be regulated under the RFA. NMFS revenue data is 
also more current than alternative data from either BLS or Census 
Bureau and is replicable, which improves responsiveness to updates for 
inflation or any future adjustments to the size standard. Importantly, 
use of NMFS data makes it possible to evaluate the robustness of size 
standards to potential economic effects and it ensures consistency with 
the data used for conducting small entity impact analysis under the 
RFA.
    In order to undertake a more precise review, NMFS developed a 
National database of total annual receipts from commercial fishing 
operations constructed from data reported to NMFS in the Pacific 
Islands, Alaska, West Coast, Southeast, and Greater Atlantic regions, 
and for Atlantic Highly Migratory Species. Total nominal receipts from 
all available sources of fishing revenue earned while fishing in State 
or EEZ waters from any commercial fishing vessel issued a Federal 
permit were included. Annual total revenues were compiled for the most 
recent 5-year period of available complete data, which was from 2019 to 
2023. Ownership information of fishing vessels is included on the forms 
submitted by vessel owners for annual renewal of fishing permits for 
some but not all fisheries. For this reason, vessel-level annual 
receipts were the unit of observation for each commercial fishing 
entity. This is an establishment-based definition for entity size.
    The resulting database consisted of 16,374 entities with average 
annual receipts from 2019 to 2023 of $2.956 billion for all 
establishments (table 1). The distribution of fishing revenue by 
interval of fishing revenue size is also shown in table 1. Nation-wide, 
there were 5,923 vessel entities (36 percent of the total) with 5-year 
average revenue of less than $5,000 with aggregate receipts of $7.2 
million or 0.24 percent of total receipts. By contrast, the largest 
share of aggregate receipts was 28.8 percent for the 572 entities (3.5 
percent of the total) with average receipts of between $1 million and 
less than $2.5 million.
    The SBA methodology identifies four primary factors for describing 
industry structure; average firm size, start-up costs, industry 
competition, and size distribution of firms. Following the SBA 
methodology, average firm size is measured by the simple and weighted 
average of annual receipts; startup costs are measured by average 
assets; industry competition is measured by the four-firm concentration 
ratio; and the size distribution of firms is measured by the Gini 
coefficient (13 CFR 121.102(a)). Of these primary factors, NMFS does 
not have sufficient data on the capital value of fishing vessel assets 
and permits to reliably estimate fishing firm asset values. For this 
reason, NMFS used the simple average, weighted average, four-firm 
concentration ratio, and Gini coefficient measures of commercial 
fishing industry structure. The values for these four metrics based on 
the 5-year average receipts for each of the 16,374 entities are shown 
in column two of table 2. The SBA's industry factors at the 20th and 
80th percentiles for receipts-based size standards for all industries, 
excluding Subsectors 111 and 112 (see SBA, SBA's Size Standards 
Methodology, p. 37, table 5, June 2024), are shown in columns one and 
three, respectively, in table 2.
    Following the size standard estimation procedures and applying the 
formulas in SBA's Size Standards Methodology (June 2024) results in the 
size standards shown in column 4 of table 2. The estimated size 
standards are rounded to the nearest $500 thousand as required by SBA. 
Specifically, the size standard for the NMFS National simple average of 
$180 thousand would be $10 million; the size standard for the NMFS 
National weighted average of $1.84 million would be $13 million; the 
size standard for the NMFS National four-firm concentration ratio of 
less than 2 percent would be $9 million; and the size standard for the 
NMFS National Gini coefficient of 0.811 would be $35.5 million. 
Applying these size standards to the national database of commercial 
fishing establishments results in a range of small entities from 16,361 
small (13 large) to 16,374 small (0 large) (see table 3). For purposes 
of comparison, the current NMFS size standard of $11 million is shown 
in the bottom row of table 3. Under the current NMFS size standard 
there would be 16,367 entities classified as small and 7 classified as 
large. All entities would be classified as small using the Gini 
coefficient factor. For all other industry structure factors, at least 
99 percent of NMFS national commercial fishing establishments would be 
classified as small entities. Omitting the Gini coefficient, the 
average of the size standards for simple average, weighted average, and 
four-firm concentration ratio is $10.7 million, which rounded to the 
nearest whole million would be $11 million.

Sensitivity Analysis
    For the initial estimation of size standards reported in tables 2 
and 3, the 5-year average revenue was based on all vessels reporting 
fishing revenues during at least 1 year from 2019 to 2023. This means 
that the 5-year average revenue includes years where commercial fishing 
receipts for some establishments or entities were zero. Additionally, 
the 5-year period from 2019 to 2023 includes the year 2020, during 
which the COVID-19 global pandemic had general effects on the U.S. 
economy but was also particularly disruptive for seafood markets and 
trade. More recently, prices received by commercial fishing vessel 
owners were down by a nation-wide average of 10 percent during 2023 
compared to average prices during 2019 to 2022. While the declines in 
prices received in Alaska were more pronounced, prices were also lower 
in other fisheries throughout the United States.
    To examine the robustness of the size standards reported in table 
2, adjusted average receipts were estimated to (1) account for 
participants with zero receipts in some years by using only non-zero 
receipts for the years from 2019 to 2023; (2) remove the effects of the 
COVID-19 global pandemic by using the 4-year average from 2019 to 2023, 
excluding 2020; and (3) remove the 2023 Low Price Effects by using the 
4-year average from 2019 to 2022. The resulting industry metrics and 
size standards for the three evaluated scenarios are reported in table 
4. For each scenario, the industry metrics differed from the ``Base'' 
reported in table 2; however, the small entity size standard for 
weighted average was unchanged at $13 million and the size standards 
for the simple average and four-firm concentration ratio differed by no 
more than $0.5 million. Across all three scenarios the Gini coefficient 
was lower than the Base, but, as was the case shown in table 3 for all 
of the sensitivity scenarios, 100 percent of commercial fishing 
establishments would still be classified as small (see table 5). 
Additionally, at least 99 percent of small entities would be classified 
as small under any of the evaluated scenarios.

    The size standards by industry structure metric for the Base (5-
year average including $0 receipts values) and for the three 
sensitivity scenarios are reported in table 6.

    As previously noted, the size standard for weighted average 
receipts is unchanged and the simple average size standard was $10 
million for Base and two of the three sensitivity scenarios. The four-
firm concentration ratio was $8.5 million for all three sensitivity 
scenarios compared to $9 million for the Base. Excluding the Gini 
coefficient, when averaging across all other factors, the Base and the 
three sensitivity scenarios yield an average size standard of $10.6 
million, which rounded to the nearest whole million would be $11 
million.
Market Conditions
    NMFS produces an annual summary of economic performance for U.S. 
commercial fisheries in the Fisheries Economics of the United States 
Report (FEUS). The most recent report, from 2022, is available at 
<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/fisheries-economics-united-states-reports">https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/fisheries-economics-united-states-reports</a>. The report provides information on landing, 
revenue and trends. The report also describes the U.S. commercial 
fisheries' economic impact on the economy. Per the FEUS 2022 report, 
there was a continued decline in revenue over the prior 5 years (see 
table 1 on page 6 and figure 3 on page 7). Specifically in 2022, U.S. 
commercial fisheries experienced a 16-percent decrease in revenues as a 
result of falling prices, which dropped 11 percent in real 2022 
dollars. The report also notes that while average landing prices had 
increased in 2021 likely due to inflationary pressures and stronger 
recovery from the COVID-19 global pandemic, 2022 landing prices had 
reverted back to pre-pandemic levels. The primary species that 
contributed the most to the decline in revenue were Alaska pollock, 
Gulf shrimp, American lobster, and sea scallops. The FEUS 2022 report 
also notes a number of structural factors throughout the supply chain 
that likely contributed to the decline in landing prices and the 
resulting decline in average revenue.
    NMFS recently published the Alaska Seafood Snapshot in August of 
2024 (available at <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/s3/2024-10/ak-seafood-industry-snapshot-10-31-2024-afsc.pdf">https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/s3/2024-10/ak-seafood-industry-snapshot-10-31-2024-afsc.pdf</a>), which reported that the 
Alaska seafood industry experienced a direct loss of $1.8 billion 
between 2022 and 2023. The decrease in revenues in 2023 was largely 
driven by low seafood prices across nearly all Alaska species as a 
result of global market forces; high inventories and high levels of 
global supply; lower global consumer demand for seafood due to 
inflation; and lower cost of seafood production and

processing in countries that compete with U.S. seafood products.
    With regards to Gulf Shrimp, revenue decline is largely 
attributable to decreased landings price as domestic shrimp producers 
faced a supply and demand mismatch and unfair competition from imports, 
as determined by the U.S. International Trade Commission. In an article 
by Blank, C., they noted that U.S. shrimp sales were down in 2023, and 
market difficulties were expected to continue in 2024 (available at 
<a href="https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/premium/foodservice-retail/shrimp-sales-down-in-2023-experts-forecast-continued-difficulties-in-2024">https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/premium/foodservice-retail/shrimp-sales-down-in-2023-experts-forecast-continued-difficulties-in-2024</a> 
(accessed July 11, 2025)). To date, the Department of Commerce has 
levied countervailing and antidumping duties on imports of select 
countries and the NMFS' Shrimp Futures Initiative is working to 
understand the challenges facing the Southeast's shrimp fisheries.
    NMFS does not anticipate these various structural factors 
throughout the supply chain to be fully resolved in the near term. 
Therefore, NMFS will continue to monitor these factors and assess if 
additional reviews or revisions to the size standard are warranted.
Determination
    Based on the results of the review, NMFS has determined the small 
business size standard of $11 million in annual gross receipts 
continues to reflect the size distribution of all businesses in the 
commercial fishing industry and is appropriate for continued use for 
RFA purposes only. Therefore, no revision to the standard is warranted 
at this time. NMFS will monitor industry structure, market conditions 
and other relevant factors as necessary to ensure the size standard 
remains appropriate to meet the intent of the RFA.
