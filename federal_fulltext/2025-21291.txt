14 CFR Part 71

[Docket No. FAA-2025-1187; Airspace Docket No. 24-AWP-84]
RIN 2120-AA66


Modification and Revocation of Class E Airspace; Hawaiian 
Islands, HI

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This action modifies the Class E5 airspace areas extending 
upward from 700 feet above the surface at Lihue Airport (LIH), Lihue, 
HI; Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL), Honolulu, HI; and 
Ellison Onizuka Kona International at Keahole Airport (KOA), Kailua-
Kona, HI, by adding an additional layer of Class E5 airspace area 
extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface. This action 
complies with the international laws and treaties, and satisfies the 
State of Hawaii's domestic airspace requirements. Additionally, this 
action revokes the portions of the existing Class E5 airspace area 
1,200 feet above the surface that extends beyond 12 miles from the 
shorelines of the Hawaiian Islands into international airspace. This 
action further modifies the Class E4 airspace area designated as an 
extension to a Class D or Class E surface area at KOA and revokes the 
Class E4 airspace area at LIH. These actions support the safe and 
efficient management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at 
airports within the Hawaiian Islands.

DATES: Effective date 0901 UTC, January 22, 2026. The Director of the 
Federal Register approves this incorporation by reference action under 
1 CFR part 51, subject to the annual revision of FAA Order JO 7400.11 
and publication of conforming amendments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Authority for This Rulemaking

    The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is 
found in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, Section 106 
describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, 
Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's 
authority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described 
in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, 
the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of 
the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the 
efficient use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority as it revokes the Class E5 1,200 feet above the surface 
airspace area designated as the ``Hawaiian Islands'' and the Class E4 
airspace area at LIH, and modifies the Class E4 airspace area at KOA 
and the Class E5 700 feet above the surface airspace areas at LIH, HNL, 
and KOA. These actions comply with international laws and treaties, 
while also supporting IFR operations for the State of Hawaii.

History

    The FAA published an NPRM for Docket No. FAA 2025-1187 in the 
Federal Register (87 FR 36400; August 4, 2025), proposing to: (a) 
modify the Class E5 airspace areas 700 feet above the surface at Lihue 
Airport, Lihue, HI; Daniel K. Inouye International Airport, Honolulu, 
HI; and Ellison Onizuka Kona International at Keahole Airport, Kailua-
Kona, HI; (b) revoke the Class E5 airspace area 1,200 feet above the 
surface surrounding the Hawaiian Islands; (c) modify the Class E4 
airspace area for KOA; and (d) revoke the Class E4 airspace area for 
LIH. This action complies with the international law associated with 
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 
international treaties provision from Proclamation 5928, Territorial 
Sea of the United States. A final rule issued by the FAA in 2019 rule 
incorrectly applied the concept of ``archipelagic states'' under UNCLOS 
to justify connecting the islands with contiguous Class E airspace. 
However, FAA has since determined that because Hawaii is a U.S. state, 
it is not an archipelagic state under international law, and therefore 
is not entitled to such treatment. This notice proposes corrective 
action to realign the Hawaiian Class E airspace with U.S. jurisdiction 
and international legal standards, restricting it to airspace over U.S. 
land and territorial waters.
    Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking 
effort by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. Two 
comments were received in favor of the airspace proposal.
    One commenter recommended that the FAA consider additional 
clarification to the flying public regarding aircraft separation 
standards while transiting between the Hawaiian Islands in situations 
where flight operations may transition between domestic and 
international airspace boundaries.
    The FAA acknowledges the commenter's suggestion. However, aircraft 
separation standards do not change in this context, as the FAA has been 
delegated controlling authority for air traffic service in the Hawaiian 
region, both domestically and internationally.

[[Page 54229]]

    One commenter suggested that the FAA ``provide a brief 
environmental review on the potential impacts of modified approach 
procedures to the local community and sensitive habitat.''
    The comment is not germane to the scope of this airspace action. 
The FAA's action modifies only the controlled airspace areas associated 
with Hawaiian Islands; it does not modify approach procedures for any 
of the Hawaiian airports, although some airspace boundaries are 
modified to better contain existing procedures. The potential 
environmental impacts of this action have been addressed under the 
FAA's environmental review process, as discussed below, and after 
evaluation was determined to qualify for categorical exclusion rather 
than a higher level of environmental review.

Differences From the NPRM

    The FAA is modifying the airport reference points (ARP) geographic 
coordinates used in the airspace legal description for the Class E5 
airspace area associated with HNL, Class E4 and Class E5 airspace areas 
associated with KOA, as proposed in the NPRM. However, in addition to 
those proposed changes, this final rule also modifies the ARP 
geographic coordinates within the Class E5 airspace area legal 
description. These changes align with the FAA's aeronautical database.
    These changes are needed to maintain consistency with the proposed 
controlled airspace areas parameters. Specifically, the FAA has 
substituted alternative geographical coordinates (Point in Space) to 
replace previously used reference points to describe the airspace 
boundaries associated with the legal descriptions of the airports' 
controlled airspace areas.
    These changes are minor and ministerial in nature, and do not 
impose additional requirements on regulated parties. Accordingly, the 
FAA finds good cause to bypass additional notice and comment.

Incorporation by Reference

    Class E4 and Class E5 airspace areas are published in paragraphs 
6004 and 6005, respectively, of FAA Order JO 7400.11, Airspace 
Designations and Reporting Points, which is incorporated by reference 
in 14 CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This document amends the current 
version of that order, FAA Order JO 7400.11K, dated August 4, 2025, and 
effective September 15, 2025. These amendments will be published in the 
next update to FAA Order JO 7400.11. FAA Order JO 7400.11K, which lists 
Class A, B, C, D, and E airspace areas, air traffic service routes, and 
reporting points, is publicly available as listed in the ADDRESSES 
section of this document.

The Rule

    This action amends 14 CFR part 71 by modifying Class E5 airspace 
areas 700 feet above surface at LIH, HNL, and KOA. Additionally, this 
action revokes the Class E5 airspace area extending upward from 1,200 
feet above the surface over the Hawaiian Islands. The Class E5 (1,200 
feet above the surface) airspace area is redefined to comply with U.S. 
territorial boundaries and international airspace sovereignty 
provisions by limiting the airspace to 12 miles from the State's 
coastline, as explained above. Each of the three airports' Class E5 
(700 feet above the surface) airspace areas are modified to include an 
additional layer of Class E5 (1,200 feet above the surface) airspace 
area, designed to contain its respective island groups' territorial 
lands and coastal waters.
    The LIH Class E5 (700 feet above the surface) airspace area is 
modified to incorporate additional Class E5 airspace area extending 
upward from 1,200 feet above the surface that encompasses the islands 
of Kauai and Niihau, and the islet of Kaula, limited to 12 miles from 
the coastline. The Class E5 (700 feet above the surface) airspace area 
is also modified to better contain the Very High Frequency 
Omnidirectional Range (VOR) or Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) Runway 
(RWY) 21 instrument approach procedure for LIH, extending upward from 
700 feet above the surface within a 4.3-mile radius of the airport, and 
extending to the 7.3-mile radius between the airport's 354[deg] bearing 
clockwise to the 192[deg] bearing.
    In addition, the Class E airspace area designated as an extension 
to a Class D or Class E surface area (Class E4 airspace area) is 
revoked, as arriving aircraft descends through 1,000 feet above the 
surface are already contained within the LIH Class D and Class E 
surface areas.
    The HNL Class E5 (700 feet above the surface) airspace area is 
modified to incorporate an additional Class E5 (1,200 feet above the 
surface) airspace area that encompasses the islands of Oahu, Molokai, 
Lanai, Kahoolawe, and Maui, but limited to 12 miles from the coastline. 
Additionally, the legal description for the Honolulu Class E5 (700 feet 
above the surface) airspace area is updated as follows: (1) the 
location is amended from Honolulu International Airport to Honolulu, 
and (2) the airport's name is amended from Honolulu International 
Airport to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport.
    The KOA Class E5 (700 feet above the surface) airspace area is 
modified to incorporate an additional Class E5 (1,200 feet above the 
surface) airspace area encompassing the island of Hawaii, but limited 
to 12 miles from the coastline. The KOA Class E5 (700 feet above the 
surface) airspace area is also modified to better contain the VOR 
Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)/TACAN RWY 17 approach procedures. 
The amended Class E5 (700 feet above the surface) airspace area extends 
upward from 700 feet above the surface within the airport's 7.4-mile 
radius, and within 4 miles of either side of the airport's Point in 
Space Alpha 002[deg] bearing, extending from the airport's 7.4-mile 
radius to 11 miles north. Additionally, the KOA Class E4 airspace area 
is modified to better contain the previously mentioned instrument 
approach procedures descending through 1,000 feet above the surface, 
extending upward from the surface within 2.8 miles either side of the 
airport's Point in Space Alpha 186[deg] bearing, extending from the 
airport's 4.3-mile radius to 5.7 miles south, and within 3.6 miles 
either side of the airport's Point in Space Alpha 002[deg] bearing, 
extending from the airport's Point in Space Alpha 4.3-mile radius to 
9.5 miles north. Lastly, the airport name was updated in its legal 
description from Kona International Airport at Keahole to Ellison 
Onizuka Kona International at Keahole Airport.

Regulatory Notices and Analyses

    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an 
established body of technical regulations for which frequent and 
routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. 
It, therefore: (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under 
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); 
and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the 
anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that 
only affects air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified 
that this rule, when promulgated, does not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Environmental Review

    The FAA has determined that this action qualifies for categorical 
exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321, 
et seq.) and in accordance with FAA Order 1050.1G, ``FAA National 
Environmental Policy

[[Page 54230]]

Act Implementing Procedures,'' paragraph B-2.5.a. This airspace action 
is not expected to cause any potentially significant environmental 
impacts, and no extraordinary circumstances exist that warrant 
preparation of an environmental assessment.
